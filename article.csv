0,Baidu plans to mass produce Level 4 self-driving cars with BAIC by 2021,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/13/baidu-plans-to-mass-produce-level-4-self-driving-cars-with-baic-by-2021/,2017/10/13,"Baidu, China’s internet technology giant, hopes to be in the business of mass producing autonomous cars by 2021, thanks to a partnership with BAIC Group, a Chinese automaker which will handle the manufacturing part of that equation. BAIC Group is one of Baidu’s many partners for its Apollo autonomous driving program, and it’ll use the open platform to produce vehicles with Level 3 autonomous features by 2019 before moving on to fully self-driving Level 4 cars by 2021, the companies announced today.
Baidu will contribute cybersecurity, image recognition and self-driving, as well as its DuerOS virtual assistant capabilities, and BAIC will integrate those technologies into its own vehicles. The two anticipate that by 2019, more than 1 million of BAIC’s production vehicles will feature Baidu networking tech, and the companies will be working on building out an automotive cloud-based ecosystem of products and services, too, including crowd-sourced traffic info and more.
Just last month, GM announced that it would be mass producing its own self-driving vehicles with subsidiary Cruise Automation. The GM large volume autonomous car is based on the Bolt platform, but features more integrated self-driving sensors and computing technology designed to be produced at scale.

1,"New Tesla voluntary recall applies to 11,000 Model X vehicles",https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/12/new-tesla-voluntary-recall-applies-to-11000-model-x-vehicles/,2017/10/12,"Tesla is taking a “proactive measure” out of an “abundance of caution,” the company says, in handling an issue with a cable used in the adjusting of second-row seating in a small percent of Model X vehicles. The automaker has issued a voluntary recall, which will apply to 11,000 Model X vehicles it would like to inspect — though it believes only 3 percent of those cars actually exhibit the issue.
The problem was discovered via internal testing, per Tesla, and basically involves the cable that controls the reclining of the two rear seats being too tight in some vehicles, which means that when the seats are folded back up from a flat position, they might not fully lock in place again. This could theoretically result in problems if adults are in the seats in case of an accident, though Tesla says that they haven’t seen anything related to this issue in the field, or in any customer car as of yet.
Tesla will be emailing customers with affected models today, and will be arranging service appointments. Both 2016 and 2017 Model X vehicles were affected, but the good news is that Tesla says that even if it finds a vehicle has the problem, no additional parts are required and the fix takes only about 10 minutes.
The carmaker also says it can actually address the recall entirely using its global mobile service fleet, meaning that no one should have to technically go into a service location to get it fixed. Tesla says that it’s currently managing as much as 30 percent of its repairs in some markets using the mobile service option, and that it has done 40 percent of the Takata airbag recall servicing it handled in the last month via this method.
A Tesla spokesperson provided the following statement to TechCrunch regarding the Model X recall:

Tesla is taking a proactive action to ensure the safety of some of Model X owners who may need an adjustment to their second row seat. Model X has received the highest rating in every category and subcategory in independent safety tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and we continue to conduct our own internal testing to ensure that Model X remains the safest SUV in the world.

During recent internal testing, Tesla determined that a small number of cables in the second row fold-flat seats in some 2016 and 2017 Model X vehicles may need to be adjusted. Although Tesla has not received reports of any issues or accidents relating to this condition, we will be conducting a voluntary recall to inspect the affected vehicles and confirm whether any adjustment is needed. Although we have never seen any incidence of it in the field, internal testing has indicated that if the cable is not properly adjusted, the seat back on the left side of the second row seats could move forward during a crash.

Tesla will be utilizing its mobile repair service to conduct repairs as a part of this recall – we can address 100% of these repairs via mobile service, and customers will have the choice to do that or to bring their car into a Service Center. In the past two months, we have conducted roughly 40% of the Takata airbag recall repairs via mobile service, and customer satisfaction results for our mobile service offering are consistently above 97%.

2,CarGurus spikes 72% in auto marketplace IPO,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/12/cargurus-spikes-72-in-auto-marketplace-ipo/,2017/10/12,"Used-car marketplace CarGurus spiked more than 72 percent during its first day of trading.
The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company had raised more than $150 million after pricing its IPO at $16. By the end of trading Thursday, shares had gone up more than 72 percent, closing at $27.58.
In a conversation earlier this morning with CarGurus CFO Jason Trevisan, he claimed that the business has become “the largest platform for both consumers and dealers to find a car.” He said that CarGurus has managed to sign up moe than 40,000 dealers on the platform, or more than 90 percent of the auto dealership businesses in the U.S.
CarGurus does not make money per transaction. Instead, it’s a freemium model, with dealers paying for full functionality of the CarGurus platform.
The company also has been building out its peer-to-peer marketplace, which does not currently generate revenue. Eventually, Trevisan says that the company will sell transaction-related services like escrow, warranty or financing.
In addition to traditional car dealerships, CarGurus competes with TrueCar, Cars.com and AutoTrader.com. TrueCar initially struggled following its 2014 IPO, but turned things around two years ago.
Trevisan said CarGurus, which was founded in 2006, was able to shun traditional venture financing because the company was cash-flow positive early on. He said that the business launched with just $4 million in funding from friends and family, but eventually raised money from mutual funds.
Revenue last year was $198.1 million. The company brought in $6.5 million in profit. This compares to $98.6 million in revenue and losses of $1.6 million in 2015.
The largest shareholders are Argonaut 22, T. Rowe Price and Allen & Co.
CarGurus hopes to use the proceeds from the IPO to further expand internationally, adding markets beyond Canada, U.K and Germany. The company also plans to do a bit of hiring, with a particular focus on developers and engineers.
The company listed on the Nasdaq.

3,Waymo releases its first self-driving ‘Safety Report’,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/12/waymo-self-driving-safety-report/,2017/10/12,"Waymo launched a campaign earlier this week alongside partners, including the National Safety Council, to help explain why it believes that its pursuit of autonomous driving is a means to safer roads. Now it’s releasing its first-ever Safety Report, which offers more detail on the procedures and technology it uses to ensure safety in deploying its autonomous fleet.
The 42-page document includes a summary overview of how Waymo’s cars function at a basic level, including under what conditions they work (and are designed to work exclusively) and how they “fail” back to a safe stop as a final fallback. It also explains what happens after a crash, should there be one, and what kind of data is recorded, as well as what measures are taken in terms of cybersecurity on the Waymo vehicles.
Waymo also details both its hardware and software testing processes, including crash avoidance and the overall durability of its sensors and other equipment. Finally, it spells out how a rider experiences driving in its cars, and how the technology works in the case of interacting with emergency vehicles, law enforcement and other first responders.

The document kicks off with a series of facts and figures designed to impress upon the reader the need for autonomous driving, and its potential impact in terms of making roads safer (94 percent of U.S. accidents were human-caused, for instance), economics ($594 billion in costs related to accidental death and injuries per year) and mobility (79 percent of Americans 65 and older live in communities that require cars to get around, basically).
Waymo also breaks down the five basic categories it uses for defining “safety” relative to its autonomous vehicles, including behavioral safety (driving decision on the road), functional safety (safe operation, including backups and redundancies), crash safety (ability to protect people within the car), operational safety (safety and comfort in interaction between passenger and car) and non-collision safety (safety for anyone interacting with the vehicle in any capacity, basically).
The report also details the sensor system, explaining what each does, and covers LiDAR, vision and radar — as well as supplemental sensors, including microphones to pick up emergency vehicles and other road noises.
Crucially, it also explains the “operational design domain” that Waymo uses to define where and when its vehicles can safely operate. This encompasses a range of factors needed for safe driving, including geographies, types of roads, range of speed, time of day, regulatory requirements and even weather.
The full Safety Report is embedded in its entirety below, and I recommend reading it if you’re at all interested in AV tech. It’s not only a good indication that Waymo does as it has always said and takes safety very seriously, but it’s also a comprehensive look at the company’s approach to self-driving as a whole, if a bit surface-level for experts in the field.

4,LG to open Europe’s largest EV battery factory in Poland next year,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/12/lg-to-open-europes-largest-ev-battery-factory-in-poland-next-year/,2017/10/12,"LG is opening Europe’s largest factory for building lithium-ion batteries destined for use in electric cars, the company announced. Its LG Chem division is going to open the doors for the facility in 2019 in Poland near Wroclaw, per Reuters, and the facility will be able to supply as many as 100,000 EV batteries per year beginning next year.
For comparison, Panasonic’s latest battery facility in China can make enough to supply the production of around 200,000 vehicles per year, and the Gigafactory hopes to eventually produce enough for around 500,000 vehicles per year. The Gigafactory at its current capacity, which is nowhere near total eventual output, is producing more batteries than any other factory in the world, according to Elon Musk.
Battery production could become a major choke point for vehicle electrification as more automakers shift more of their model lineups to EVs and hybrids. More factories can definitely help, but supply of base materials could become an even bigger hindrance in the future.

5,California DMV changes rules to allow testing and use of fully autonomous vehicles,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/11/california-dmv-changes-rules-to-allow-testing-and-use-of-fully-autonomous-vehicles/,2017/10/11,"The California Department of Motor Vehicles is changing its rules to allow companies to test autonomous vehicles without a driver behind the wheel — and to let the public use autonomous vehicles.
The DMV released a revised version of its regulations and has started a 15-day public comment period, ending October 25, 2017.
California law requires the DMV to work on regulations to cover testing and public use of autonomous vehicles, and the regulator said that this is the first step.
“We are excited to take the next step in furthering the development of this potentially life-saving technology in California,” the state’s Transportation Secretary, Brian Kelly, said in a statement.
California’s DMV took pains in its announcement to highlight that it wasn’t trying to overstep the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which has the final say on developing and enforcing compliance with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.
Rather, the California regulations, are going to require manufacturers to certify that they’ve met federal safety standards before their cars become (driverlessly) street legal.
And manufacturers still have to obey the state traffic laws written for California.
The revised regulations are the result of feedback from automakers, consumer advocates, local governments and insurance companies, the DMV said in a statement. It had previously released regulations on March 10, and this update incorporates the feedback from those various stakeholders into the current version of the rules.
Specific changes include, specifying local notifications on planned driverless testing, developing a template for how to report when a driver has disengaged autonomous modes, and identifying concerns that “would trigger an amended driverless testing or deployment applications to the DMV.”
California has had rules in place for driverless vehicles since 2014. As of now, 42 companies hold permits to test autonomous vehicles on California roads, the DMV said.
Written comments can be submitted to LADRegulations@dmv.ca.gov until October 25, 2017. Current regulations are availble on the California website under the “trending” section at the DMV homepage.
With the new revised regulations, California drives a bit farther down the road for autonomous vehicle testing, but it’s not alone. Singapore has already established zones for autonomous vehicle testing, and other nations are pushing to assume the pole position in the autonomous vehicle race.
Meanwhile, car companies are going to great lengths to see how well drivers can adjust to autonomous, driverless cars on the road. Witness Ford’s epic pranking of everyone by dressing up a driver as a car seat.

6,Porsche launches on-demand subscription for its sports cars and SUVs,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/10/porsche-launches-on-demand-subscription-for-its-sports-cars-and-suvs/,2017/10/10,"Want to drive a Porsche, without actually owning one? Porsche’s new Passport subscription program could be just what you’re looking for. The on-demand short-term rental program allows anyone in Atlanta to subscribe for $2,000 per month, which will provide access to eight models of Porsche including the 718 Boxster, Cayenne and Cayman S at launch.
Those who want a bit more can sign up for the Accelerate program, which is $3,000 per month, but which provides access to a total of 22 Porsche models and variants, including the 911 Carrera S, the Macan GTS and the Cayenne S E-Hybrid SUV.
The price of membership may seem steep, but it covers tax, registration, insurance, maintenance and even detailing fees, which can really add up when you’re talking about a Porsche. Also there’s a one-time $500 activation fee, as well as both a background and a credit check which is probably a fairly reasonable ask given the value of the vehicles you’ll be getting.
Atlantans who sign up can get their vehicles delivered on-demand to the location of their choosing in the metro Atlanta area starting this November, and then can exchange their cars for other models also using the Porsche Passport app. This Atlanta pilot, and its results, will determine whether Porsche continues to grow the program in the future.
Subscription-baesd car programs are increasingly an option automakers are looking to change up ownership and deal with the changing demands of customers. Cadillac debuted its own similar program early this year, and it’s likely going to be an option more car makers look at as consumers look around for alternatives to buying vehicles outright or traditional leasing models.

7,Velodyne quadruples LiDAR production to meet self-driving demand,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/10/velodyne-quadruples-lidar-production-to-meet-self-driving-demand/,2017/10/10,"Velodyne, largely considered the current leader in LiDAR tech for autonomous vehicle development, announced today that it has increased its production capacity by more than 400 percent in order to meet growing global demand. This means it’s now actually offering immediate availability for its LiDAR sensors, for the first time in a long time, for clients in Europe, Asia Pacific and North America.
This new capacity has come from a boosted production rate at Velodyne’s gigantic 200,000 square foot Megafactory, and it has doubled its full-time employee count over the past six months as well to help spur production. Velodyne’s HDL-32/64 LiDARs, the classic ‘chicken bucket’ design you’ve likely seen on autonomous test vehicles in media photos or out in the real world, is the industry standard at the moment, with relatively few competitors even approaching the company in terms of production capability.
Velodyne has some emerging competitors, however, including startup Luminar, which emerged from stealth with a large workforce and production-ready design earlier this year. But it’s also working on new versions of its own LiDAR which will decrease cost and conspicuousness on a path toward production AVs.

Nvidia Holodeck (yes, it’s actually called that) in an “intelligent virtual reality platform” created by the GPU maker that offers collaborative virtual environments with simulated real-world physics, highly detailed models built using photorealistic graphics at life-size scale. It’s not built to help Captain Picard live out film noir detective fantasies or swashbuckle the seas, however; Nvidia’s Holodeck is aimed at helping designers prototype, review and tweak designs to make it possible to bring products to market faster.
Holodeck is also AI-ready, meaning that you can train agents and deploy them in the virtual space to test your designs against anticipated real-world conditions, including virtual operators and incidental personnel and staff who might interact with any machinery or other objects being prototyped before they’re built.
Already, Nvidia has won praise from top architects, NASA engineers and cutting edge designers, based on their experience with pre-release testing. Now, it’s opening up to early access for a broader group, with the aim of refining it further.
Collaborative VR design tools are catching on in a big way among automakers, who are increasingly building out initial trials of virtual collaboration in service of vehicle design. There are plenty of other potential applications, too, and Nvidia could be poised to lead this shift given its experience on both the graphics side and in building AI that can enhance the simulated environments in use.

The Drive PX Pegasus builds on its predecessor the Drive PX 2, offering over 10 times as many operations per second in terms of computing capability, and it’s already being used by over 25 companies to develop fully driverless taxi vehicles for eventual deployment.
The self-driving computer is built on Nvidia’s CUDA GPUs, and also increase the practicality of the computing hardware requirements for actually fielding self-driving cars on real roads. Nvidia points out that vehicles today using Nvidia tech to field on demand autonomous taxis include basically entire data centres in the trunk, and Drive PX Pegasus is designed to help put them on track to bring this down to something more manageable for actual production deployment.
Drive PX Pegasus packs in four AI processors, including two of Nvidia’s latest generation Xavier system-on-a-chip models with embedded Nvidia Volta GPUs, with two next-generation discrete GPUs designed specifically to hep accelerate deep learning and computer vision. The overall size of the system is roughly that of a license plate, Nvidia says, and it greatly reduces energy consumption and overall cost as well.
Pegasus is set to be available to Nvidia partners during the second half of 2018, while companies can get started now with Drive PX 2 if they want to chart a path to upgrade later on.

10,Deutsche Post DHL to deploy self-driving delivery trucks by 2018,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/10/deutsche-post-dhl-to-deploy-self-driving-delivery-trucks-by-2019/,2017/10/10,"At Nvidia’s GTC Europe conference today, one of the company’s partners detailed plans to bring an autonomous delivery fleet to operating status starting in 2018. Deutsche Post DHL Group wants to put trucks on the road in partnership with auto supplier ZF by that time frame, using electric light transport vehicles equipped with ZF’s Nvidia-based ProAI self-driving system.
DPDHL will help make this happen staring now, by equipping its fleet of 3,400 electric delivery StreetScooter vehicles with ZF sensors, including video cameras, as well as LiDAR and radar. The data gathered by these vehicles will help inform ZF’s ProAI self-driving system, teaching the AI to be able to navigate itself along the delivery routes handled by DPDHL once its autonomous trucks are ready to come to market.
In addition to the Nvidia-powered ZF ProAI self-driving tech, which uses Nvidia’s Drive PX AI computers, DPDHL is also using Nvidia’s DGX-1 AI supercomputer in its data center to train the neural networks that will prove the basis for its future autonomous delivery fleet.
Nvidia and DPDHL unveiled the prototype electric light delivery vehicle at GTC Europe today, equipped with six cameras, plus two LiDAR sensors and a radar array.

11,"Waymo teams with MADD, the NSC and more on self-driving education",https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/09/waymo-teams-with-madd-the-nsc-and-more-on-self-driving-education/,2017/10/09,"Waymo is working with a number of organizations on a new self-driving education campaign to help answer questions the public has about autonomous vehicles and technology. The program is designed to provide easily accessible info that offers answers to questions including “are self-driving cars safe?” and “how do they know what to do?” and it includes participation from Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the National Safety Council, the Foundation for Blind Children, the East Valley Partnership and the Foundation for Senior Living.
The new campaign, called “Let’s Talk Self Driving” will include both digital and outdoor advertising, with an initial focus on Arizona, where Waymo is currently testing its autonomous ride hailing service in a limited pilot. The plan is to eventually expand this into a national program, with exposure to Waymo’s self-driving tech for the general public a key aspiration for its expansion.
Waymo’s partners in this program might be the most indicative of how it hopes to drive acceptance of autonomous vehicles among members of the public who might be skeptical about sharing the roads with self-driving cars. MADD National President Colleen Sheehey-Church notes in a statement that self-driving could “completely eliminate drunk driving and other causes of traffic deaths,” while the NSC says that “automation holds incredible promise” but that “Americans will need to understand what self-driving vehicles can and can’t do.”
Both the Foundation for Blind Children and the Foundation for Senior Living focus on the message of how autonomous driving could increase independence and mobility for populations for which that’s currently a challenge, and the East Valley Partnership adds in support for the potential of autonomy to decrease congestion and unlock more productive time.
Waymo basically couldn’t have asked for better partners in this initiative, in terms of outlining the potential public benefit of rolling out autonomous vehicles nationwide. Public acceptance, which will have a tremendous effect on regulatory concerns, will be as important as technology in bringing self-driving vehicles to consumers, so this campaign is likely to be one of many attempts to move the needle on general awareness.

12,Cruise acquires Strobe to help dramatically reduce LiDAR costs,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/09/cruise-acquires-strobe-to-help-dramatically-reduce-lidar-costs/,2017/10/09,"Cruise, the self-driving car startup GM acquired last year, has acquired a startup of its own – Strobe, a LiDAR sensor maker that reduces an entire LiDAR array down to just one chip, which Cruise says will be instrumental in helping it reduce the cost of LiDAR on a per vehicle basis by nearly 100 percent.
The cost issue is a big one: LiDAR remains one of the single most expensive component in the autonomous vehicle stack, and it’s a bottleneck not just in terms of cost, but also in terms of manufacturing complexity and performance and reliability over time across all types of weather, as Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt notes in a Medium post announcing the news.
Vogt says that decreasing costs for autonomous vehicles will be key in deploying them across a range of different areas, including in the suburbs and outside of major cities, where currently the economics would make it difficult to deploy something like an autonomous ride hailing service.
Strobe’s LiDAR component
Strobe’s technology offers accurate measurement of both distance and velocity, Vogt says, and combined with radar, can provide information vital to decision-making for self-driving cars. Strobe will bring their team and founders to Cruise, and Cruise will work with both its new engineers and with GM resources to develop LiDAR tech along with GM’s Hughes Research Labs skunkworks team.
Velodyne is currently the industry leader in terms of LiDAR employed in self-driving vehicle technology, but many are trying to improve the cost, form factor and reliability of LiDAR parts. Another startup, Luminar, recently revealed the scale of its own operation, and it’s also announced that it’s working with Toyota Research Institute along with other select partners to add its capabilities to autonomous test vehicles on the road.

He noted that it was “tentatively” scheduled, leaving the door open for a date change if need be. Turns out that was a good call.
In a tweet this afternoon, Elon says the Semi unveil date is now set for November 16th — a shift of about three weeks.
The reasoning for the rescheduling? Musk mentions two things they’re focusing on right now instead: Model 3 bottlenecks and Puerto Rico battery production.


Tesla Semi unveil now Nov 16. Diverting resources to fix Model 3 bottlenecks & increase battery production for Puerto Rico & other affected areas.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 6, 2017



Yesterday morning Musk offered Tesla’s assistance in rebuilding Puerto Rico’s electric system after the devastation of Hurricane Maria left just 10 percent of the island with power; by the afternoon, the governor of Puerto Rico was tweeting back to say he wanted to talk about it.
As for the Model 3 bottlenecks mentioned: Tesla aimed to ship around 1,500 Model 3s in the third quarter of 2017, but disclosed on Monday that they’d ended up shipping around 260. While the company pinned the shortfall on production bottlenecks, they noted that they already “understand” the underlying issues and are “confident of addressing the manufacturing bottleneck issues in the near-term” — so, presumably, tackling those issues will be a key part of these next few weeks.

14,Udacity spin-out Voyage is testing self-driving cars in retirement communities,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/04/udacity-spin-out-voyage-is-testing-self-driving-cars-in-retirement-communities/,2017/10/04,"Voyage, the self-driving technology company that spun out of Udacity earlier this year when some executives and students decided to commercialize their work, has been testing its autonomous vehicles in a retirement community in San Jose, and is looking to expand its trial.
The testing at Villages Golf and Country Club in California has involved using a modified Ford Fusion equipped with self-driving software and additional sensors, including LiDAR and radar, in a community which has about 4,000 residents. The roads, which are controlled in terms of allowed traffic, offer a good starting point for autonomous testing, according to a new report from The New York Times, because they cut down on the number of variables that have to be taken into account.
So far, Voyage has been testing on 15 miles of road that are shared with pedestrians, pets, other cars and even golf carts — but all with a max speed limit of 25 miles per hour. And though the roads are used like public ones, they’re private, which gives Voyage leeway in terms of how much information about its testing it has to disclose to public entities and regulators.
Voyage also thinks retirement communities are a good target audience in terms of AV use: seniors who no longer drive themselves stand to benefit a lot from being able to regain independence through the use of self-driving ride-hailing services and on-demand transportation.
The NYT reports that Voyage had to jump through a few hoops to make the test work — including paying double for insurance and agreeing to hand over anonymized data to its insurer, and providing an equity stake in the company to the Villages itself. But it sounds like a logical test starting point, and also a way to approach the problem differently from some of Voyage’s larger competitors.

15,Dyson seeks to beat rivals on range with its electric car,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/04/dyson-seeks-to-beat-rivals-on-range-with-its-electric-car/,2017/10/04,"Dyson is building an electric car, the company revealed last week, and now we know a bit more about their specific plan to bring one to market. Dyson won’t look to partner, and will instead build the vehicle hardware from the ground up itself, according to a new Wired interview with Dyson CEO Max Conze. By relying on its own battery and motor tech, Dyson hopes to be able to beat the range of existing electric vehicles by between 50 and 100 percent, Conze says.
That would indeed be a differentiating point for Dyson with its offering, and probably the best chance it has at delivering a product that can woo consumers away from electric offerings from traditional carmakers and the likes of Tesla. And Dyson says it wants to “do its own thing,” and use in-house engineering “that can do the car end-to-end and also […] own the manufacturing.”
Dyson isn’t planning on building its own self-driving software, however, and predicts it’ll be able to buy autonomous systems “off the shelf” from suppliers once the time comes for that technology to be properly integrated into a shipping vehicle.
Going it alone seems like a big challenge for a newcomer to the auto industry like Dyson – but Conze tells Wired it’s actually going to be an advantage in many ways, because they don’t have to build upon what came before. A clean slate means they can focus their efforts on something brand new, and a vehicle platform tailored totally to their electric goal.
Dyson also added that it’s not planning on investing significantly in charging infrastructure because it hopes to improve range to the point where needing to charge frequently isn’t an issue. Critics have expressed skepticism about the vacuum maker’s ability to pull this off, and seeming nonchalance about key factors like infrastructure seem to back up those doubts, but Dyson does have deep expertise with maximizing electric motor efficiency – and a history of demonstrating focus when it comes to innovating product categories that others have overlooked.

16,Judge delays Waymo/Uber trial until December 4th,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/03/judge-delays-waymouber-trial-until-december-4th/,2017/10/03,"This morning, Judge William Alsup ruled that the Waymo v. Uber trial would be delayed until December 4th. The trial had initially been expected to start with jury selection next Tuesday on October 10th. Ultimately this gives Waymo additional time to review new documents associated with the Stroz report in advance of the start of the trial.
Waymo has been pushing for the delay to account for the mountain of materials in need of review surrounding Stroz’s due diligence report. The report, which was published online last night, was commissioned to explore potential IP concerns around Uber’s acquisition of Otto.
During arguments today, Waymo’s legal team noted that the volume of documents related to the report is “shocking.” These are documents that Waymo is just getting its hands on and has not fully evaluated in advance of the start of the trial. Part of the team’s irritation is that it has allegedly asked for these documents to be sent over multiple times with no headway made.
Uber on the other hand has been cautious about letting pre-trial discovery drag on. Its legal team says that the majority of the documents Waymo wants to dig through have been secured in a storage facility since 2010. They assert that Waymo has already spent 4,450 hours reviewing materials and that the company is unlikely to find additional evidence in the old collection of documents.
Meanwhile Judge Alsup remains frustrated with both sides for presenting in “half truths.” Alsup said that despite the quality of the lawyers he has had to evaluate everything said. He spent significant time today evaluating the validity of statements made by both sides.
“I believe that Waymo has exaggerated the need for continuance and it’s not nearly as dire as what has been represented to me,” Judge Alsup asserted.
Despite his annoyance, he still decided to grant a continuance — a delay in the start of the trial. Jury selection will now occur on Nov 29th. The trial will run from December 4th until December 20th.
The delay did come with terms however. Judge Alsup’s new schedule is non negotiable and prevents new discovery absent stipulation or a overriding decision from Magistrate Judge Corley.
Over the coming weeks, Waymo will be looking to tie one of its trade secrets to Uber’s work. Waymo will be allowed to bring a motion to amend its list of nine trade secrets, alleged to have been stolen by Uber, up until October 23rd.
That list of nine trade secrets is said to be cemented barring an extreme discovery. If a major discovery is made and the list is allowed to be amended, Uber would be granted additional discovery.
Uber sent the following comment following the decision.

“The Court has made clear that Waymo’s case is not what they hoped, and that more time will not change the hard fact that their trade secrets never came to Uber. We’re ready to go to trial now, and will be ready after this very brief continuance.”

17,GM’s Cruise explains why self-driving tests in dense cities gives it an edge,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/03/gms-cruise-explains-why-self-driving-tests-in-dense-cities-gives-it-an-edge/,2017/10/03,"GM is sharing more info about its testing process for autonomous cars through Cruise, the startup it acquired last year. For the first time, Cruise has shared some numbers related to the advantages it says its program has by placing emphasis on city testing, vs. testing only in less densely occupied areas.
“Cruise does the majority of its testing, or at least a significant portion of it, in San Francisco, and in particular the most dense part of San Francisco,” explained Cruise CEO and founder Kyle Vogt on a call related to the news.
“The big thing that we want to point out today, is that driving in San Francisco is almost nothing like driving in the suburbs or other places where self-driving cars are tested,” Vogt explained. “There’s a lot of talk about miles, but really miles are not created equally.”
Vogt’s reference to talk of “miles” is almost certainly an indirect jibe at Alphabet’s Waymo, which frequently reminds the public that it has the most miles of autonomous vehicle testing to its credit among companies working on the problem. Also, Vogt followed up quickly with another veiled reference to Waymo’s testing program, which is running a trial ride hailing service in Arizona.
“In more suburban areas like Scottsdale, which is a suburb of Phoenix, we actually have data so we can compare the two,” Vogt said. Hey added that in the city (of SF specifically), tricky maneuvers like passing vehicles by crossing over into opposing lane of traffic actually happen quite frequently, as opposed to in suburbs.

In fact, this kind of thing happens 23.5 times as often in dense urban environments vs. sparsely populated suburbs. And it’s the same when it comes to interacting with emergency vehicles, Vogt said, noting that Cruise’s vehicles encounter and have to interact with emergency vehicles almost 47 times as often in San Francisco vs. in a test environment like Scottsdale.
“As human drivers, we don’t draw too much of a distinction between driving in a suburb and driving in a city,” Vogt said, noting that actually they’re very, very different. He added that the reason Cruise has this focus isn’t arbitrary, but because it wants to test in the most challenging conditions in order to accelerate the deployment of actual AVs on roads.
Vogt says the complexity of running autonomous vehicles on roads is actually exponentially harder in urban cases, because the more objects you see, the more complex interaction between those objects have to be considered. In a simple environment, he noted, generally a vehicle is only doing one thing at a time. In dense conditions like San Francisco, all of these are stacked up on top of each other – like making a lane change while in presence of an emergency vehicle.
In response to a question about whether this announcement was a direct shot at Waymo, which has deployed a test pilot as mentioned above in a suburban area in Phoenix, Vogt said that “I’m saying there’s almost no comparison between driving in a suburban environment and in an urban one.”
Cruise’s testing is broadly split about equally in terms of the divide between suburban and city environments, per Vogt. He also provided a brief update on the progress of the company’s San Francisco based ride-hailing service pilot for employees.
“It’s given us some valuable feedback on what’s important from the customer standpoint,” he said. “We’ve been able to make some tweaks to our software to improve the experience.”

18,Tesla electric semi truck possibly spied in new photo,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/03/tesla-electric-semi-truck-possibly-spied-in-new-photo/,2017/10/03,"Is this the new semi truck Tesla is set to unveil at the end of this month? The truck, posted to Reddit (then deleted, then re-posted) bears more than a passing resemblance to the image shared in a teaser released by the automaker itself (via The Verge). The sleek angled front also looks like something you’d expect to be electrically powered, if that makes any sense.
You can compare it yourself to the mostly shadowy teaser image shared by Tesla itself, but the main unifying factor here might be those flared fenders and angled headlights, which you can pretty clearly make out in the Reddit spy shot, too. The photo above was taken “somewhere in California,” where apparently Tesla has been known to test vehicles in the past.
Tesla’s officially revealing its semi truck on October 26, at an event teased by Elon Musk himself. The truck is rumored to have a range of between 200 and 300 miles on a single charge, which would be very impressive for an all-electric heavy-duty transport vehicle, though not something that’s suitable for long-haul trips. The big question will be how it charges – and how fast.

19,The due diligence report commissioned by Uber before acquiring Otto is now public,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/02/the-due-diligence-report-commissioned-by-uber-before-acquiring-otto-is-now-public/,2017/10/02,"A potentially pivotal document in the legal fight between Uber and Waymo, the self-driving car company that was originally part of Google, has been released. It is a report (embedded at the bottom of this post) commissioned by Uber from cybersecurity firm Stroz Friedberg last year as part of its due diligence before acquiring Otto, a self-driving truck startup founded by former Google employees. Stroz was asked to investigate whether or not Otto co-founder Anthony Levandowski, a former Google engineer who worked on Waymo, and other Otto employees took confidential information from Google or breached their non-compete clauses.
Waymo, which filed a lawsuit against Uber in February, has fought for the document’s release, arguing that it likely contains information relevant to its allegations that Levandowski stole thousands of files from Google and brought them to Uber. It also said it may answer some of the questions Levandowski has refused to answer by exercising his Fifth Amendment rights. Uber, which fired Levandowski in May, declined to provide it, claiming that the document contains confidential information between attorneys and clients.
After a federal circuit judge ruled last month that Uber must hand over the report, Waymo said it needs more time to review it and asked for the trial, which is scheduled to start in a week, to be postponed. A hearing will take place tomorrow on whether or not to grant Waymo’s request.
Stroz investigators reviewed over 100,000 documents, 74,000 pictures and 176,000 source code files for the report. It shows that Levandowski accessed Google files, including ones related to the design of driverless cars, even after he left the company, but it doesn’t conclude what he did with them.
Among other revelations, Levandowski told Stroz that he found five discs containing Google information in a closet while searching his house for devices to give the investigators, but had them destroyed at a commercial shredding factory called Shred Works in Oakland. Levandowski told Stroz that they contained proprietary information, including source code and design files related to Google self-driving cars.
Levandowski also said that he informed Uber employees, including chief executive officer Travis Kalanick, about the existence of the discs in March 2016. He says Kalanick said he wanted nothing to do with the discs and told Levandowski to “do what he needed to do.” After that, Levandowski says he took them to Shred Works and watched as they were destroyed.
Stroz followed up during its investigation by visiting Shred Works, but couldn’t confirm if the documents were indeed ordered destroyed by Levandowski. While a Shred Works facility manager found a receipt that indicated it had received cash to destroy five discs around the time Levandowski told Uber about them, the signature on the receipt was illegible and no one at the faciility recognized Levandowski from a photo Stroz showed them.
Stroz also said it found 50,000 work emails from Levandowski’s time at Google on his personal computer. Levandowski claimed that he did not remember when he last looked at the emails and “seemed surprised” at how many of them were on his laptop. But because ten of those emails were accessed between September 2015 and January 2016, when Levandowski left Google, Stroz investigators wrote that it was “difficult to believe that Levandowski was not, prior to his interview, fully aware of the extent of the data that he had retained.”
Stroz found that Levandowski had accessed Google files even after he left the company and then deleted them, including source code and electronic design files related to driverless cars. He also asked an unknown recipient to delete iMessages from him during the investigation and even attempted to empty the trash on his Macbook Pro while he was at Stroz’s office, but investigators found no files contained in his trash at the time he tried to empty it.
Investigators wrote that even though Levandowski may have deleted those files in “good faith” to comply with Google’s requirements, he shouldn’t have after he knew the investigation was going to take place:
“Many of these deletions may have been good faith attempts by Levandowski to purge retained Google material from his devices in accordance with his obligation not to retain confidential Google data. However, by March 2016, Levandowski was aware that Stroz Friedberg was going to implement a process to preserve, identify and potentially remediate retained Google material from his devices. At that point, the better course would have been to let that process control. In addition, there was an effort by Levandowski and his Ottomotto colleagues to delete texts in real time.”
In a press statement, an Uber spokesperson said:
“Before Uber acquired Otto, we hired an independent forensics firm to conduct due diligence because we wanted to prevent any Google IP from coming to Uber. Their report, which we are pleased is finally public, helps explain why—even after 60 hours of inspection of our facilities, source code, documents and computers—no Google material has been found at Uber. Waymo is now attempting to distract from that hard fact, even attempting to hide its core trade secrets case from the public and the press by closing the courtroom. In the end, the jury will see that Google’s trade secrets are not and never were at Uber.”
As expected, Waymo has a different take. Here is its statement about the release of the report:
“The Stroz Report unequivocally shows that, before it acquired his company, Uber knew Anthony Levandowski had a massive trove of confidential Waymo source code, design files, technical plans and other materials after leaving Google; that he stole information deliberately, and repeatedly accessed it after leaving Waymo; and that he tried to destroy the evidence of what he had done. In addition, Mr. Levandowski used his smartphone to take thousands of covert photographs of computer screens displaying Google confidential files. Knowing all of this, Uber paid $680 million for Mr. Levandowski’s company, protected him from legal action, and installed him as the head of their self-driving vehicle program. This report raises significant questions and justifies careful review.”
