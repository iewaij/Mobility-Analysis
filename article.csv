0,Delphi partners with BlackBerry QNX on its autonomous driving platform,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/20/delphi-partners-with-blackberry-qnx-on-its-autonomous-driving-platform/,2017/09/20,"Delphi is planning to launch its own autonomous driving solution for car manufacturers and mobility service fleet operators in 2019, and it announced today that it will use BlackBerry QNX as the operating system for the automated drive solution.
Both BlackBerry QNX and Delphi are long-time auto industry stalwarts who have been reconfiguring their businesses to focus on the opportunity represented by the advent of autonomous driving tech. Delphi has split its business, spinning of its powertrain arm to focus primarily on autonomy and high-tech offerings; BlackBerry QNX has shifted from a focus on infotainment solutions to software that underpins and secures self-driving.
Partnerships like this one will benefit both in terms of helping make sure that they can become key technology supply players as automakers move towards automated vehicle deployment. Delphi specifically is looking at BlackBerry QNX’s track record in safe and secure automotive software as a way to help kickstart its autonomous platform development and get it ready for real-world deployment, where it’ll face intrusion and hacking attempts.

1,Ford and Mahindra explore strategic cooperation around car tech in India,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/18/ford-and-mahindra-explore-strategic-cooperation-around-car-tech-in-india/,2017/09/18,"Ford and Indian automaker and mobility company Mahindra Group have entered into a new agreement to explore a potential strategic partnership focused on a number of different areas, including mobility, electrifications, connected vehicles and transportation infrastructure and more.
Ford and Mahindra’s initial cooperation period extends for three years, during which time the general idea is to identify opportunities for longer period collaboration. Mahindra, which manufactures cars in India as well as a range of commercial vehicles including tractors, as well as aerospace technology, would provide Ford with key expertise in operating in the potentially lucrative market. For Mahindra, gaining access to Ford’s growing expertise in connected and autonomous technology could be a significant upside.
While Ford has been a presence in the Indian auto market since 1995, and exports vehicles from its facilities in Chennai, Tamil Nadu and Sanadn, Gujarat, teaming up with Mahindra could give it more opportunity to explore future focuses of its expanded business, which increasingly looks at fleet operations, connected mobility services and more.

2,"Samsung launches $300M autonomous driving fund, puts $90M into TTTech",https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/14/samsung-launches-300m-autonomous-driving-fund-puts-90m-into-tttech/,2017/09/14,"Not to be outpaced in the connected car market by other tech giants, today the world’s largest smartphone maker, Samsung, announced two major pieces of news to take its automotive strategy up a gear. It has launched the Samsung Automotive Innovation Fund, a $300 million fund to back startups and other interesting bets in the automotive market. And as a first investment out of that fund, Samsung has put €75 million (nearly $90 million) into TTTech, an Austria-based developer of platforms and safety software for connected cars, alongside a corresponding investment from Audi.
In addition to this, Samsung also announced a strategic initiative to develop connected-car technology with Harman, the auto and audio product maker that it acquired last November for $8 billion.
“During this period of extraordinary transformation in the automotive industry, we are excited to play a leadership role in supporting and shaping the future of smarter, more connected vehicles,” said Young Sohn, President and Chief Strategy Officer of Samsung Electronics and Chairman of the Board of HARMAN, in a statement. “The Autonomous/ADAS Strategic Business Unit and automotive fund reflect the company’s commitment to the values of open innovation and collaboration. In partnership with OEMs and startups, we will make the driver and passenger experience safer, more convenient, and more enjoyable.”
While giants like GM, Volkswagen and Toyota (among others) have traditionally dominated the automotive industry, the next wave of innovations that will shape how we (and other things) get from A to B is fast coming around the bend. This leaves everything to play for, as car ownership, in-car systems, and how cars will be operated are all getting disrupted and updated through technology.
That’s driving a large wave of investment. Car companies like GM, Volkswagen, Daimler and many others are putting billions of dollars towards backing a range of startups that are building technology and services for that brave new automotive future (a small handful of examples: GM investing $1 billion in Lyft, Volkswagen investing $180 million in smart car tech maker Mobvoi, and Ford pumping $1 billion into Argo AI for self-driving tech). Car makers are also investing internally in their own R&D to complement that.
Then there are the tech companies: Apple, Google and Baidu are also making large bets here, building autonomous cars of their own and also investing in and buying up talent to enhance those strategies (not without hiccups, of course).
Samsung is among those who are hoping to be at the forefront of these developments, looking at the car as the latest “hardware” that it can build and help control.
At the end of August, the company received a permit to run self-driving car tests in California, alongside an earlier permit that it got in Korea, and announcements like today’s will make sure that they will have not just their own tech, but that of partners, to put into those vehicles.
This is not Samsung’s first move to invest in automotive tech. Previous investments have included automated driving startups AImotive, Renovo; Quanergy, TetraVue, and Oculii for sensors; Autotalks and Valens for connectivity; and Graphcore for high-performance computing, the company noted.
It doesn’t look like there has been a full round amount disclosed for Samsung’s investment TTTech but we are trying to find out. Prior to today, the startup had raised around $54 million, with backers including Audi, General Electric and Infineon — another sign of the players that are hoping to have a seat at the table (or behind the wheel, if we’re looking for a relevant metaphor) in the next generation of automotive solutions.
TTTech works on road, air and aerospace systems — its systems are used in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and NASA’s Orion — but it said that Samsung’s investment will be used specifically to augment the work it has been doing with Audi on self-driving car systems for the Volkswagen Group (which owns Audi). This is about getting Samsung chips and other equipment into cars, and the companies are already showing off how the results will look:

TTTech specialises across a range of services like “functional safety, deterministic networking, real-time systems, and complex software integration” for autonomous and other automated systems, and its safety tech powers the piloting program on the Audi 8.
“Automotive advances like autonomous controls and advanced driver assistance systems will have a profound impact on society—from transforming urban spaces to bringing mobility to aging populations.   At Samsung, we see it as our responsibility to invest in the technologies that will revolutionize the way we live, work, and connect with one another,” said Samsung’s Sohn. “TTTech has demonstrated a remarkable ability to innovate and build world-class technologies and platforms. This is a seminal moment for Samsung and our Automotive Innovation Fund, and we look forward to working with leading OEMs like Audi and the entire TTTech team to set a new standard for automotive-safety technology.”
“There is already a high demand for ADAS solutions, and that demand is rapidly growing with the advancements in connected cars and autonomous driving,” said Dinesh Paliwal, President and CEO of HARMAN, in a statement. “This strategic business unit demonstrates Samsung’s and HARMAN’s commitment to answer that call – to be the definitive partner for seamless and integrated technologies. It also reflects the incredible power that Samsung and HARMAN, as a collective force, will bring to our OEM customers as we combine Samsung’s scale and resources with HARMAN’s deep automotive experience and networks. Together, we are driving the future of automotive.”
HARMAN has named John Absmeier Senior Vice President of the unit, alongside his current position as VP of smart machines.

3,UK’s FiveAI gets $35M to build a taxi service powered by its own self-driving car platform,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/uks-fiveai-gets-35m-to-build-a-taxi-service-powered-by-its-own-self-driving-car-platform/,2017/09/05,"The race is on for autonomous vehicle technology, and now a startup out of the U.K. is the latest to throw its hat into the ring to help build it. Cambridge-based FiveAI — a partner in the U.K.’s StreetWise self-driving project — has raised £14 million ($18 million) and £12.8 million ($17 million) in two tranches to fill out its plans for a two-part business in the world of self-driving services. First, FiveAI is building its own autonomous driving system; and second, FiveAI will use that AI-based platform to take on Uber and other transportation services with a fleet of self-driving taxis.
Lakestar Capital — the firm founded by prolific (and successful) investor Klaus Hommels — led this Series A round, with Amadeus Capital Partners, Notion Capital and Kindred (which all previously invested in its seed round of $2.7 million) also participating.
On top of the Series A, FiveAI will also get a boost in the form of a grant from the U.K. government: it has so far received £12.8 million ($17 million) for StreetWise, a project it’s working on with Transport for London, the Transport Research Laboratory, Oxford University, insurer Direct Line and others to develop a self-driving car pilot for London to cut traffic congestion and free up parking spaces. StreetWise is slated for its first test runs at the end of 2019.
There are many, many companies today working on autonomous car systems. They include other startups like Zoox and Nutonomy (which, like FiveAI, are building platforms that they plan to use in their own fleets), transportation providers like Uber, car makers (which themselves are acquiring startup talent to kickstart their efforts), those like Bosch that build in-car systems already and, of course, tech giants like Google, Apple and Baidu that approach cars like the next big hardware challenge.
With the billions in funding and armies of engineers that these companies have to commit to these efforts, FiveAI’s Series A and government grant appear very modest indeed.
But Stan Boland — FiveAI’s CEO and co-founder — is not one to be deterred. In an interview earlier today in FiveAI’s (still sparse) new offices, he made a case for why Europe needs its own startup in this area. For one, our driving culture is completely different and our cities don’t look like cities in the U.S. or Asia. And further, he argues that it’s high time that we see more moonshots coming from here, building on the region’s strength in artificial intelligence.
“We think it’s time that Europe builds a big tech company,” he said, noting that transport could well be at the heart of that big tech company. “Transport is a sector that is ready for change.”
It so happens that Boland is probably one founder investors will listen to when he explains a big plan. He has been at the head of some of Europe’s biggest startup exits in the last several years: they include Element 14, a spin-out from ARM that was acquired by Broadcom for $640 million; Icera, acquired by Nvidia for $367 million; and IoT startup Neul, acquired by Huawei, before moving on to FiveAI with other co-founders Ben Peters, Steve Allpress, John Redford and Simon Walker.
“If anything, the bolder you are with investors, the more they seem to want to give you,” he said. (This may be a consequence of the aforementioned track record. I’m fairly certain that if, say, I walked into Klaus Hommels’ office and described my vision for an autonomous car startup, I might get quietly escorted out of the room.)
“FiveAI is a fantastic example where the U.K. has the talent, ambition and market to build a truly successful technology-led company. Dense European cities present totally different technical, behavioral, regulatory and infrastructure challenges to their U.S. and Chinese counterparts for safe urban driverless technologies,” said Lakestar Capital’s Dharmash Mistry, who is joining FiveAI’s board with this round. “By assembling its talented team in the U.K. and seeking to support London’s transport objectives in partnership with the city itself, FiveAI can play a vital role in reducing congestion, emissions, costs, accidents and journey times, boosting the city economy at the same time.”
To be clear, he also added that FiveAI has raised exactly as much as it wanted to, for now, and he also said that he has also put some of his own money into the operation, as well.
To date, FiveAI has yet to launch any products, and if you have been following the autonomous car space you know there are many pieces that will need to come together before FiveAI, or any other company, can hope for large deployments.
Boland describes FiveAI today as in “Phase One” of its business plan: it is building an autonomous platform to run vehicles, which will include demonstrating the platform’s cognitive abilities and running pilots. Phase Two will include the development of a dispatch system, the user experience development and the first commercial launch. It will also involve much more work to improve the regulatory environment “to make it feasible.” He believes this will come in 2021.
Phase Three will be FiveAI’s big push to scale in the market. “It’s at that point that we will need to buy lots of cars,” where FiveAI’s autonomous system will be loaded, he said. “It’s probably at that point that we’ll need to raise a significant amount of money, in the hundreds of millions or billions.”
As for a Plan B, there is no Plan B that Boland will consider today.
“We do recognize that startups do pivot, but we are not running multiple contingency plans right now,” he said. 
“It may sound completely mad to some,” he said, “but the reason why we think it’s needed and will work is because personal mobility is not going to be a winner takes all market. There is no single solution that will work everywhere. We can change public transport.”
FiveAI is not revealing its valuation with this round.

4,Auto giant Continental buys Singapore-based Quantum Inventions for $29M,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/21/auto-giant-continental-buys-singapore-based-quantum-inventions-for-29m/,2017/08/21,"German automotive giant Continental is furthering its push into the future of transportation after it got its check book out to acquire Quantum Inventions, a Singapore-based company that specializes in mobility data services.
The deal was announced in July with little fanfare and it is officially undisclosed, but a source told TechCrunch that it is around the SG$40 million mark — that works out to around $29 million. That’s a pretty significant exit — both in name of acquirer and deal size — for Southeast Asia’s nascent yet promising tech ecosystem.
You’d be hard pressed to call Quantum Inventions a startup, although it certainly operating in startup style. The company was founded in 2006, over ten years ago, and it has 120 staff across offices in Singapore, India, Malaysia and Indonesia. It is focused on ‘mobility solutions’ in the consumer, automotive and government/enterprise sectors. That’s a fairly broad term but essentially it means managing data to make navigation-related services run smarter and more efficiently.
One example is the work that the company has done in Singapore, where its technology has been used to used to the government develop a new satellite-based Electronic Road Pricing system, which handles tolls, parking and other fees and is designed to ease congestion. Quantum Inventions works with a Mitsubishi affiliate, which won the project’s tender, and Singapore’s NCS to manage the vast data output to glean insight and information.
“Compliance from technical standpoint very important,” Saurav Bhattacharyya, Quantum Inventions CEO, told TechCrunch in an interview. “Human compliance in any kind of system is the main issue, moving towards autonomous or advanced systems you have higher level of compliance and that’s where a central-backed congestion management platform in real-time can get to many places.”
The company doesn’t just focus on smart cities — though that is a strength of Singapore — and its other units touch on enterprise services like fleet management, in-car consumer services, and mobile apps and data such as navigation.
Bhattacharyya said that right now, mobility data is managed in commonly managed in silos, but he said this practice will change in the future as increased usage of the cloud and city planning centralizes data and processes.
The business itself had become profitable with 50 percent compound growth over the past decade, so why sell now when the future is still to come?
Bhattacharyya said the initial plan was to go to market to raise funding, but after being subject to acquisition interest, Quantum Inventions looked at its options. Beyond a financial exit for investors and the team, he said it was drawn to Continental as a partner that can open doors while adding tech and other resources.
“We had a few suitors over the last year, one of the important things for us was to ensure we have a company that knows it takes R&D to stay ahead and have global relationships,” he said. “You can raise $100 million but can’t buy relationships.”
On that latter point, he expects that his company will be able to develop much faster with more resources at its fingertips.
“We come in as a strong engineering fit,” Bhattacharyya added. While the deal “leaves us independent, with the backing of Continental’s global channels — that’s testament to what we have created.”
For now the plan is to continue the business as it is — with an enrichment of resources — but in the future as the market changes, so the business may also shift its focus.
“We will keep our verticals but may align to certain strengths or relationships that Continental has, but still covering automotive and cities. Logistics is very strong and we’ll intend to keep doing that, maybe couple of years down the line makes sense to harmonize platform into one,” he explained.
Continental has been busy brokering deals in Asia lately. It recently announced a joint venture with operator China Unicom focused on transport systems, and it has partnered with Baidu to develop self-driving cars.
“Asia continues to play an ever increasing role in our strategy,” Helmut Matschi, member of the Executive Board at Continental and head of the Interior division, said in a statement. “Now the purchase of Quantum Inventions underline our focus on developing mobility services solutions. We are excited to provide an expanded portfolio of customized solutions in the dynamic mobility services market.”

5,Snapsheet raises $12 million to save you time after a car accident,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/13/snapsheet-raises-12-million-to-save-you-time-after-a-car-accident/,2017/06/13,"Chicago-based Snapsheet has raised $12 million to streamline the process after car accidents. The company has built a mobile application that surveys the vehicle damage and serves as a virtual appraiser.
The latest round of funding is led by Tola Capital and comes just months after a $20 million Series C.
“Snapsheet’s virtual claims platform streamlines and simplifies the claims handling process for everyone – the carrier, the customer and the repair shop,” Sheila Gulati, managing director at Tola Capital says about why she invested.
Co-founder CJ Przybyl said that they’ve been getting a lot of funding opportunities because they “invented the category.” It not only saves time for the car owners, but it also benefits insurance companies.
Snapsheet allows the insurance businesses to offer a “white label self-service mobile app,” he explained. While some of them, like Allstate, have opted to create this themselves, Snapsheet has managed to convince 45 insurance carriers to work with them.
Snapsheet makes money by charging for each estimate they provide. They’ve been hiring former appraisers to inspect the photos submitted via the app from home.
Przybyl says they will be using the funding to improve their machine learning capabilities. They’ll also be expanding internationally.
And while they’ve raised a lot of capital, they’re “not planning on an IPO,” he said. At the moment, Przybyl is “not sure what our exit plans would be.”

6,Auto site Carvana tumbles 26% in stock market debut,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/28/auto-site-carvana-tumbles-26-in-stock-market-debut/,2017/04/28,"Carvana, the site for buying and selling cars, had a rough first day in the public markets. After pricing its IPO at $15 per share, it ended the day down 26 percent, at $11.10.
Bankers typically recommend a price that would cause the shares to go up about 20 percent or so on the first day, known as a “pop.” But Carvana maximized every last dollar in its $225 million offering, at the cost of new investors.
They’re still hoping the IPO will raise their profile and bring about new customers. Carvana wants to make shopping for a car as easy as buying a book on Amazon.
“We built a website that’s very easy to navigate,” CEO and founder Ernie Garcia, told TechCrunch. “The customer response has been very strong.”
With vending machines in Texas and Tennessee, customers can buy a car without having to interface with pesky salesmen. They also can order directly on the website and get free shipping if they live in one of the 21 target markets, primarily in the eastern half of the country. Others throughout the continental U.S. can still order cars through Carvana, but may have to pay for shipping.
These aren’t new cars. They are older vehicles that Carvana obtains directly from consumers, rental car fleets or expired leases.
Carvana’s revenue is growing fast. Last year they brought in $365.1 million in revenue, compared to $130.4 million the year before and $41.7 million the year before that.
But losses are growing, too. The company lost $93.1 million last year, compared to $36.8 million the year before.
When asked about a growing portion of young people shunning car ownership in the age of Uber, Garcia downplayed concerns. “There are certain markets where that’s a trend,” but he’s selling to a “broad mix of customers.”
Launched just four years ago, Phoenix, Arizona-based Carvana doesn’t fit the profile of a typical internet IPO.  Like its Silicon Valley brethren, Carvana received funding prior to the IPO, but instead chose not to share investor names. The S-1 filing only shows CEO Ernest Garcia and CVAN Holdings as 5 percent stockholders, the threshold for required disclosure.

7,Char.gy taps into lampposts to charge your electric car,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/10/char-gy-zaps-the-street-furniture-for-super-powers/,2017/04/10,"If you have a garage with a power socket, an electric car makes an awful lot of sense. If you park on the street, however, the infrastructural challenge of keeping your electron-powered vehicle topped up becomes complicated enough that perhaps sticking to driving on squished dinosaurs makes sense for a while longer. Until Char.gy comes along, that is.
“Seventy-two percent of drivers in London don’t have off-street parking,” says Richard Stobart, CEO of the London-based Char.gy. “If you want an electric car, not being able to charge at home is a major disincentive.”
So, in a world where people want to drive electric cars, cities are trying to clean up the air and car makers want to sell electric cars, how do you take on the not insignificant challenge of charging car batteries in a dense and fast-moving city such as London? You tap into other, already existing infrastructure, of course.

“People want to charge their cars while they are doing something else, preferably when they are parked at home and asleep in their beds,” Stobart points out, and offers a solution. The company has developed charge points that connect to the existing street furniture: Lampposts. Makes sense: The cables are already there, the local government owns them, and once you’ve gone that far, you may as well make the next couple of logical steps.
“Our vision is that there will be several lampposts near your home with a charge-point that you can park near to charge overnight,” Richard explains. “We are developing a platform to manage the charging too, using a business model not dissimilar from mobile phone contracts. Users pay a monthly fee for access to the charge points and a free allocation of charge.”
The early-stage company is running a pilot program with Richmond Council in London, installing a number of units in Barnes and Kew, with the first charging points appearing later this summer.
“We are trying to create a win-win solution for everyone, not least local government,” says Stobart, addressing part of the challenge of building a marketplace with multiple players. “We are making it seamless and effectively free for the councils and solving the problem of half of all public charge points being out of service.”

9,"Intel buys Mobileye in $15.3B deal, moves its automotive unit to Israel",https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/13/reports-intel-buying-mobileye-for-up-to-16b-to-expand-in-self-driving-tech/,2017/03/13,"First they partnered, and now comes the acquisition: The computing giant Intel has confirmed that it is acquiring Mobileye, a leader in computer vision for autonomous driving technology, for $15.3 billion — the biggest-ever acquisition of an Israeli tech company.
Specifically, “Under the terms of the agreement, a subsidiary of Intel will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Mobileye for $63.54 per share in cash, representing a fully-diluted equity value of approximately $15.3 billion and an enterprise value of $14.7 billion,” the company noted in a statement. The deal is expected to close in about nine months, Intel said.
Mobileye today covers a range of technology and services, including sensor fusion, mapping, front- and rear-facing camera tech and, beginning in 2018, crowdsourcing data for high-definition maps, as well as driving policy intelligence underlying driving decisions. This deal will bring under Intel’s umbrella not only a much bigger range of the different pieces that go into autonomous driving systems, but also a number of relationships with automakers. In the call today, Mobileye’s CTO and co-founder Amnon Shashua said the company is working with 27 car manufacturers, including 10 production programs with Audi, BMW and others going into 2017.
“This acquisition is a great step forward for our shareholders, the automotive industry and consumers,” said Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO, in a statement. “Intel provides critical foundational technologies for autonomous driving including plotting the car’s path and making real-time driving decisions. Mobileye brings the industry’s best automotive-grade computer vision and strong momentum with automakers and suppliers. Together, we can accelerate the future of autonomous driving with improved performance in a cloud-to-car solution at a lower cost for automakers.”
“We expect the growth towards autonomous driving to be transformative. It will provide consumers with safer, more flexible, and less costly transportation options, and provide incremental business model opportunities for our automaker customers,” Ziv Aviram, Mobileye co-founder, president and CEO, added. “By pooling together our infrastructure and resources, we can enhance and accelerate our combined know-how in the areas of mapping, virtual driving, simulators, development tool chains, hardware, data centers and high-performance computing platforms. Together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry.”
Confirming our earlier report, Intel said that Mobileye’s CTO and co-founder, Prof. Amnon Shashua, will lead Intel’s autonomous driving division, which will be based in Israel. Doug Davis, Intel’s SVP, will oversee how Mobileye and Intel work together across the whole company and will report to Shashua.
Other notable exits that have tapped into Israel’s expertise in computer vision and machine learning have included Google buying mapping startup Waze for $1.1 billion and Apple buying 3D sensor specialist PrimeSense for reportedly around $300 million.
The negotiations about what stays where for Mobileye and Intel are reminiscent of one of the other big M&A deals in Israel’s tech history, concerning Waze. Originally, Waze was being courted by Facebook, although there were disagreements over where Waze’s staff would be centered: engineering wanted to stay in Israel while Facebook was keen to get them to Facebook’s HQ in Menlo Park. Ultimately, that delay led to Google swooping in, agreeing to Waze’s terms and closing the deal.
Intel has been working officially with Mobileye since last year. Earlier this year, with BMW, the two started to test 40 self-driving cars equipped with the two companies’ technology. Mobileye was also an early partner of Tesla’s for its autonomous technology, although that relationship is ending amid some controversial undertones about safety measures at the carmaker. Other investments that Intel has made in the space of cars include taking a stake in Here (which will feed into the mapping initiatives at Mobileye); acquiring Itseez and Yogitech for safety and navigation functionalities in autonomous cars; making a commitment of at least $250 million to the space (which sounds so tiny considering today’s price tag); keeping a strong presence at auto shows; and, in November, launching a dedicated autonomous driving group, which is headed up by Doug Davis, who will now report to Mobileye’s CTO.
Mobileye went public on the Nasdaq in 2014 and currently has a market cap of about $10.5 billion. It’s trading up now more than 33 percent ahead of the market opening on the news. As a point of context, the company had moved only 0.83 percent on Friday’s trades.
Intel had been a leader in processors at the peak of the PC era, although it has competed hard (and often lost) as smartphones overtook the larger devices as consumers’ computers of choice.
Moving deeper into self-driving technology is part of Intel’s bigger strategy to build up its position in emerging areas of computing. Other verticals that Intel has focused on include connected “objects” (IoT) and virtual and augmented reality. It has been following through on this strategy with acquisitions as well as organic growth.
“The combination is expected to accelerate innovation for the automotive industry and position Intel as a leading technology provider in the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles,” the company continued. “Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to $70 billion by 2030. The transaction extends Intel’s strategy to invest in data-intensive market opportunities that build on the company’s strengths in computing and connectivity from the cloud, through the network, to the device.”
Intel has disclosed several other acquisitions in Israel to fill out that strategy, including buying a personal assistant platform from Ginger Software; Omek Interactive for gesture-based technologies; and Replay Technologies for 3D video.
Intel is not the only company that is investing in and acquiring startups in the area of computer vision to raise its game in the area of autonomous cars.
Just earlier today, Valeo, the automotive parts giant, announced that it had acquired gestigon, a start‑up out of Germany that develops in-car 3D image processing software — used both to communicate to the driver as well as pick up signals from within the car and from the driver to communicate to a self-driving (or partially self-driving) car what to do next.
Terms of the deal, which includes staff as well as IP, were not disclosed. Valeo has been a regular investor in autonomous driving tech, taking a stake, for example, in French autonomous shuttle company Navya and getting a license in California to test self-driving cars. This latest acquisition shows that it remains serious about doing more in this area.
We’ll be dialing into the companies’ call with investors in about 30 minutes and will update this story with more then.

10,India-based used car marketplace Truebil refills its tank with $3M raise,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/16/indias-truebil-raises-3-million/,2017/02/16,"Truebil, a marketplace for selling used cars in India, has closed a $3 million post-Series A funding round from China’s Shunwei Capital. Its $5.5 million Series A was raised in January 2016.
Unlike more traditional rivals like CarTrade, which just raised $55 million led by Singapore’s Temasek, its sister site CarWhale and Cardekho, Truebil dis-intermediates the professional auto trader because it enables direct consumer-to-consumer transactions.
Truebil was founded in 2015 and it is currently present in Mumbai and Bangalore. The company said it is selling 200 cars per month, with 1,000 new listings going up each month. Aside from the marketplace, it also offers a service that buys offline and sells refurbished vehicles: Truebil Direct. The firm purchases used vehicles from owners, which are then refurbished and sold on the site as a more premium option. Truebil Direct is also unique because it allows an owner to sell their car instantly.
The company said its revenue is growing 20 percent per month across both businesses — the marketplace and Truebil Direct. Annual GMV, it claimed, surpassed $220 million in 2016. Truebil said it will invest the new capital on operations, infrastructure and R&D. The round takes the company to $9 million from investors to date, according to Crunchbase data.

11,Look out for Ultrahaptics haptic feedback in new cars this year,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/03/ultrahaptics-launching/,2017/01/03,"aptic controls: No amount of photos can make them look good. Try it out, though: It’s a little bit like magic. If you look closely, you can see the Leap Motion that’s being used for the hand tracking. The haptic feedback comes from the ultrasonic array immediately below the Leap Motion.

Since Ultrahaptics was founded in 2013, the company has showed off a string of better and better technical demos. Which has been fun, but obviously where the rubber really hits the road (pun most emphatically intended) is when the products start showing up in the real world. 2017 may just prove to be the year that happens.
Underneath all the car-porn, Bosch’s products usually give a heads-up of what’s to come in the near future
Cars, perhaps more than in any other market, is where haptic feedback interfaces make the most sense. Car makers love the flexibility of touch screens; it means you don’t have to figure out what every button does and where it goes in the long production cycles of automobiles. You carve out a big slab of space to fit a screen, and the software guys do the rest. Makes sense; this is the exact same approach that means you can use your smartphone for a billion different things, rather than just sending SMS messages, making phone calls and playing snake. There’s a problem with touch screens, though. A big one. You can’t operate them without looking at the screen. Which is a really, really bad idea when you’re barreling down the road at 70 miles per hour in 3,000 lbs worth of steel and glass. Which brings us back to haptic interfaces.
An interface that gives you all the feels
A few weeks ago, BMW showed off the HoloActive haptic interface. It’s part of a concept car that will give you a whiff of what cars might be up to a decade from now, so who knows if that turns up next year, 20 years from now, or, oh, I don’t know, never. That’s the way of concept cars. A much more certain route to market is when large OEM suppliers start showing off technology. And that’s why a demo car from Bosch caught my attention at CES. It may just be the springboard that will catapult the Bristol-based Ultrahaptics from the relative obscurity of entertaining technical demos, to the shiny, sparkly stratosphere of real-world use.
The demonstration of the haptic feedback system at Ultrahaptics’ stand at CES. In the image, you can see the Leap Motion the company is using for tracking. Not pictured: The invisible haptic feedback that’s the actual magic sauce in this setup.
If you’re not a car aficionado, it’s possible you only know Bosch for their wiper blades. That’s cool, but whatever the logo on the front of your car, chances are your car contains more than a few parts from the German equipment manufacturer. The company makes all sorts of clever bits and pieces for cars, including ABS systems, electronics, engine injection systems and much more. It’s fair to see Bosch as the over-sized parts bin that car manufacturers pick from when they design their next-generation cars.
As part of Bosch’s CES Show Car, the company is showing off two fun new technologies that is making it easier to interact with your car without taking your eyes off the road. One is a production-ready version of neoSense, which is designed to aid drivers touchscreen “buttons” by touch.

The second technology is a haptic gesture control system. It uses Ultrahaptics’ technology to give feedback to the driver. Instead of having to touch a screen, drivers can simply move their hand in the air. The sensors “see” the hand and by using ultrasound technology, the driver can “feel” the controls. Imagine swiping to the right to skip to the next track of music, for example, and feeling a little ridge in thin air that signifies that you’ve skipped a track. Or, perhaps a better example, moving your hand up until you feel a tingling sensation signifying the air conditioning controls, before swiping left or right to turn the temperature up or down.
“We’re incredibly excited about how receptive the automotive market has been to Ultrahaptics. Gesture recognition has come a long way in the last few years. It’s now affordable for a whole range of different markets and applications,” Ultrahaptics’ CEO Steve Cliffe told me. “With its growing popularity the need for haptics has become more and more obvious. Now for the first time, with Ultrahaptics’ technology, gesture recognition is completed with the sense of touch in mid-air.”
Both Ultrahaptics and Bosch are extraordinarily tight-lipped about which (if any) car manufacturers are spooling up the use of the technology in cars, but I have it on good authority that we will see this in production cars sooner rather than later.
Haptic controls are undoubtedly going to take a bit of getting used to, but if it helps keep drivers’ eyes on the road, I’m all for it. Definitely one to keep an eye out for.

12,OS builder Thundersoft buys UI maker Rightware for $68M to expand in automotive,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/19/os-builder-thundersoft-buys-ui-maker-rightware-for-68m-to-expand-in-automotive/,2016/12/19,"Thundersoft, a company out of China that designs operating systems for drones and other connected devices, has made an acquisition to drive deeper into automotive technology: it has paid €64 million ($68 million; RMB471 million) for Rightware, a company out of Helsinki that develops graphical user interfaces for connected devices, with a special focus on automotive: its Kanzi product is currently used in some 20 automotive brands, the company said.
The deal should close in early 2017.
Thundersoft makes operating systems and other platform tools for device makers. Acquiring a company like Rightware that focuses on graphical interfaces for automotive systems positions Thundersoft as a stronger offering for customers looking at end-to-end solutions.
There is a clear opportunity here, since car makers are turning to outside partners like these to both provide technology but also guidance in how to navigate themselves as the car industry continues to evolve. (This has also been some of the logic driving car groups buying into mapping companies, and partnering with tech companies to build and develop new in-car systems.)
Thundersoft, which was founded in 2008 and is publicly traded in China, has taken strategic backing from companies like Qualcomm and Intel. It is using the acquisition not only to build out its business in the car industry, but also to help it grow more outside of China. Rightware is its first acquisition outside of China.
“The automotive market is one of the fastest growing segments for Thundersoft, and we are providing in-vehicle infotainment and cluster OS solutions to our customers worldwide,” said Larry Geng, CEO of Thundersoft, in a statement. “Cars are getting smarter — with rich applications and fully optimized OS solutions. Rightware has the best user experience design technology, which will be featured in more connected cars in the market. In combination with Rightware’s unique technology, design knowhow and world-class talent, we can bring more value to our customers and transform the automotive industry with our innovations.”
Rightware — which will continue to operate as an independent company, currently employing 50 but also now hiring more — has been around since 2009 but its last round of disclosed funding was a $5 million round back in 2014, so it seems like this, in part, is one way of expanding its business in a climate where remaining a smaller independent player may have been more challenging.
“Kanzi is expected to power over 25 million cars by 2022. With Thundersoft, we can expand this footprint further and support our customers even better,” said Jonas Geust, CEO of Rightware, in a statement. “We see that the specialisation within the global automotive industry software will continue. This creates a huge possibility for us to position Kanzi as the industry standard software solution. The arrangement further strengthens our presence in the growing Asian automotive market and complements our strong footprint in the European and American automotive markets.”
Another notable point is that Rightware originally started out focusing on building a platform for graphic interfaces for all kinds of devices, with the emphasis on phones and tablets, before focusing on cars. This in itself is an interesting shift that speaks to the pace of change in the car world today, and how many have come to see it as a key piece of “hardware” while mobile has somewhat slowed down in growth and development as customers have consolidated essentially on two platforms, Android and iOS. 
Rightware said that current management will remain and “re-invest in the company” as part of the deal. (This presumably means that they have kept a stake in the transaction at least for the initial earn out.) Existing shareholders include Finnish Industry Investment Ltd, Inventure Fund Ky, Nexit Ventures, the current management and the company founders.

13,Blackmore raises $3.5 million to build better eyes for your self-driving car,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/12/blackmore-raises-3-5-million-to-build-better-eyes-for-your-self-driving-car/,2016/12/12,"A Bozeman, Montana startup called Blackmore Sensors and Analytics Inc. has raised $3.5 million to build lidar systems that can help vehicles see more details about what’s in front of them than existing sensors do today.
The company spun out of a research and development firm called Bridger Photonics that developed lidar systems for micron-precise laser cutting and welding, originally, and then for military surveillance.
Generally lidar systems “see” by emitting beams of light every nanosecond. When the light bounces back, based on how long it takes to return, lidar determines how far away an object is.
Blackmore’s lidar systems are distinct from others on the market because they employ what’s known as frequency modulation, rather than amplitude modulation. So the light beams that Blackmore’s systems transmit will vary in color. When those colored light beams bounce back off a person, object or structure, they give Blackmore’s lidar system enough data to understand not just how far away a thing is, and how big it is, but also how it is moving.
Blackmore President and co-founder Randy Reibel said, “Because we simultaneously get range to target, and how fast a target is moving, we can get a lot of information without having to do a lot of extra computation. This is important for autonomous vehicles because you can quickly tell if there’s someone walking with a velocity signature that is normal, or slow, in a crosswalk. Or you can tell if there’s a person riding a bicycle.”
Reibel said the company’s existing lidar system is about the size of a soda can. The company will use its funding, in part, to create new systems that are miniaturized, and won’t require mechanical parts within, namely rotating mirrors to move beams of light around.
Next Frontier Capital led the Series A investment in Blackmore, joined by Millennium Technology Value Partners.
According to Next Frontier General Partner Richard Harjes, his firm sees Blackmore as “seriously ahead on the tech” that could make self-driving cars safe and a mainstream reality sooner rather than later.
The investor said he expects the company to use its funding for ongoing research and development, but also to strike strategic relationships in 2017 with original equipment manufacturers, startups working on autonomous vehicles and tier 1 suppliers to the automotive industry.
“We already have a working system, now we need to get it dialed in on a vehicle,” Harjes said.
One reason his firm backed Blackmore, the investor noted, was because of its dual-pronged approach to the market: “Blackmore has a serious lead using lidar for security applications given its defense background and this strength will drive the non-automotive aspect of the firm. This sets Blackmore apart from most others.”
The startup, which employs 22 full-time today, competes with well-funded lidar makers like Quanergy and Velodyne.

14,BMW and Baidu’s self-driving car partnership has reportedly run out of gas,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/18/bmw-baidu/,2016/11/18,"It’s been an up-and-down week for Baidu and its autonomous-driving car vision. On the plus side, the Chinese tech firm yesterday announced that it had begun testing self-driving vehicles in Wuzhen. But, on the negative, its partnership with BMW has reportedly fallen through according to comments from executives.
BMW’s China CEO Olaf Kastner reportedly told Reuters that the alliance is over because “the development pace and the ideas of the two companies are a little different.”
Wang Jing, who leads the autonomous vehicles project at Baidu, added that his company is now “open for any partners, [and] actually I’m talking to many.”
Baidu declined to comment. BMW did not immediately respond to a request for comment; we’ll update this post if it does.
Baidu had been using a fleet of modified 3-series vehicles from BMW, with tests expanding to the U.S. earlier this year. However, its tests in Wuzhen are with vehicles supplied by Chinese automakers BYD, Chery and BAIC. In August, Baidu received permission to conduct similar tests in California.
Baidu is aiming to get its first production vehicles on the road using its technology by 2018, with a broader, mass production rollout targeted for 2021.
Tests aside, Baidu has invested considerable resources into the artificial intelligence and tech that powers its self-driving cars. It partnered with chip-maker NVIDIA to develop a “top-to-bottom” platform for autonomous vehicles. Elsewhere, the search giant was part of a $150 million investment in California-based LiDAR-maker Velodyne — alongside Ford — to help make its sensor components more affordable for mass market production.
BMW, meanwhile, is reportedly aiming to launch a fully self-driving vehicle in 2025. The German automaker has reportedly accelerated its electric vehicle plans following changes at the executive level, including a new CFO, and the merger of its marketing and sales divisions for Mini and BMW into a single organization.

15,LeEco secures $600M in fresh funding as financial issues reportedly halt electric car project,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/16/leeco-funding/,2016/11/16,"There’s good news and bad news for LeEco, the ambitious Chinese tech company that is working on electric cars, smartphones, smart TVs and more.
Fresh from the leaking of an internal letter from billionaire CEO Yueting Jia which cautioned against its rapid international expansion, the company has landed $600 million in fresh funding. At the same time, however, the brakes have apparently been hit on its electric vehicle project in the U.S.
LeShi, LeEco’s Chinese parent company, raised the new cash from more than 10 Chinese companies, Reuters first reported. A spokesperson declined to name the investors specifically, but did tell TechCrunch that the backers are all Jia’s classmates from Beijing-based Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business.
Jia wrote to the company’s 10,000-plus staff earlier this month warning that the company’s growth on multiple new projects was unsustainable. LeEco began in smart TVs and a Netflix-like service, but it has fanned out into commerce, smartphones and an electric car project with U.S.-based Faraday Future.
The letter was assumed by many to mean that LeEco’s U.S. operations and the electric car project that it is working on with Faraday Future are in jeopardy. However, speaking at the TechCrunch Beijing event last week, LeEco’s North American operations lead Brian Hui denied that his business would be impacted. He also stressed that the development of the car is the firm’s “highest priority” and will continue. Hui did admit that LeEco is entering a new phase of its business which, among other things, will mean fewer large scale investments like the recent $2 billion acquisition of Vizio.
The commitment of new financing looks to have come at just the right time with reports suggesting that LeEco and Faraday Future are desperately in need of money for the car project, which is aimed at toppling Tesla.
Jalopnik reported that work on the duo’s proposed $1.8 billion manufacturing plant in Nevada has paused, while it is apparently behind on payments to its construction firm.
LeEco did not comment on the current situation of the factory when we asked. Reuters reported that the initial $300 million in capital will arrive before the end of November, wherein it will go towards the Faraday Future partnership and the fledgling LeMall business in the U.S., an e-commerce platform for selling LeEco’s hardware.

16,Samsung is buying Harman for $8B to further its connected car push,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/13/samsung-harman/,2016/11/13,"Samsung is increasing its focus on the connected car after the Korean firm announced plans to buy auto and audio product maker Harman in an all cash deal worth $8 billion.
You may best associate the name with audio equipment, but Harman is big on cars, too. The acquisition is Samsung’s largest to date and a big deal for its automotive ambitions. Around 65 percent of Harman’s sales — which totaled $7 billion over the last year — were for car-related products. Samsung added that Harman products, which included connected car devices and audio systems, are installed in an estimated 30 million vehicles worldwide.
Samsung lags Google and Apple on in-car entertainment and software systems (Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, respectively) so this deal will give it the kind of reach that could allow it to compete more evenly with its rivals inside the car.
“Harman perfectly complements Samsung in terms of technologies, products and solutions, and joining forces is a natural extension of the automotive strategy we have been pursuing for some time,” Oh-Hyun Kwon, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Samsung Electronics, said in a statement.
Terms of the deal will see Samsung pay $112.00 per share. That’s a healthy premium on Harman’s current share price of $87.65, and it gives the deal a total value of approximately $8 billion. The transaction is expected to close by mid-2017, at which time Harman will become a standalone subsidiary of Samsung. Dinesh Paliwal will continue to lead the firm as its Chairman, President and CEO, both Harman and Samsung said.
“Samsung is an ideal partner for Harman and this transaction will provide tremendous benefits to our automotive customers and consumers around the world,” Paliwal added via canned comment.
With Google rapidly advancing its automotive technology and Apple reportedly developing an electric vehicle (or not), it is perhaps not surprising that Samsung has made ground on automotive itself in 2016.
This summer, it invested $450 million into China-based electric car maker BYD, which includes Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. among its investor base. Other reports suggested that the Korean giant was also eyeing up a bid for Magneti Marelli, a manufacturing subsidiary of Fiat Chrysler.
This investment will go beyond automotive, though, according to Samsung. The firm said it plans to marry its own electronics division and expertise with that of Harman for audio — both on the consumer and professional side of business — and connected devices, aka the internet of things, or IOT for short.
IOT is still very much a buzzword, but Samsung said it plans to utilize Harman’s 8,000 developers to “deliver the next generation of cloud-based consumer and enterprise experiences, as well as end-to-end services for the automotive market through the convergence of design, data and devices.”
Other notable acquisitions from Samsung of late include Viv, a highly regarded virtual assistant from the creators of Apple’s Siri service, and cloud computing company Joyent.

17,Snapsheet raises $20 million for app to help drivers file claims after a crash,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/17/snapsheet-raises-20-million-for-app-to-help-drivers-file-claims-after-a-crash/,2016/10/17,"A Chicago-based startup called Snapsheet has raised a Series C round of $20 million to make life easier for people who have been through a car crash.
The company’s cloud-based software is used by auto insurance providers to guide users through a photo- and information-gathering process on the scene of an accident. It is basically white labeled as a mobile app for each auto insurance provider. On the back end, Snapsheet helps the insurance providers virtually process claims without having to send an adjuster to inspect a vehicle.
The startup’s Series C funding came, in part, from big names in the insurance world. The deal was led by F-Prime Capital and IA Capital Group, and joined by strategic backers Fosun Insurance Group, Liberty Mutual Strategic Ventures, Intact Financial Corp. and USAA. The startup has been working with new school insurance carriers like MetroMile and Turo, and has racked up 35 corporate clients so far, according to a company statement.
Snapsheet President CJ Przybyl said claims handling is becoming more sophisticated, thanks to technology like smartphones, crowdsourced photos, telematics and machine learning. It’s integrating all the technology it can into its platform to help insurance providers process claims more quickly, to get their customers paid as soon as possible and back in safe, repaired vehicles. The company will use its new funding for product development, and hiring especially in client support, sales and marketing roles he said.
Although he acknowledged that software like Snapsheet’s could be put to use to help other insurance providers analyze damage to homes or other property, Przybyl said auto claims represent such a huge market, the company won’t seek to expand beyond autos.
“Insurance tech is winner take most for players that really stay focused and understand how important customer service is,” he said.
Snapsheet investor and F-Prime Partner Ben Malka said one big reason his firm backed the company is the effect its technology has on the customers of auto insurance providers.
“People who use Snapsheet in conjunction with their carriers claims process end up with a superior customer experience. NPS scores are significantly better most other claims resolution methods,” he said, referencing the “net promoter scores” of auto insurance providers.
Additionally, he said, Snapsheet is tapping into new willingness on the part of insurance companies to use tech for a competitive advantage. “The insurance sector is embracing innovation more forcefully than in years past,” he said.
Przybyl said one thing Snapsheet intends to develop, given the funding, is machine learning that can predict what a customer’s questions might be, before they ask them, about filing a claim or the status of a claim. With that kind of system in place, the Snapsheet-powered app can deliver information to a customer before they have become anxious about finding it, he said.

18,"Pay-per-mile insurance startup Metromile raises $191.5M, acquires Mosaic Insurance",https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/21/pay-per-mile-insurance-startup-metromile-raises-191-5m-acquires-mosaic-insurance/,2016/09/21,"The automotive industry is in flux with the rise of self-driving and electric cars, and the concept of car ownership altogether being thrown into question. With this, the car insurance industry is changing, too, and now, an on-demand car insurance startup has raised a large round of funding as it aims to be leader of that change.
Metromile, the provider that lets you pay-per-mile for insurance, said that it has raised a whopping $191.5 million in funding — “primarily equity”, according to CEO Dan Preston. Metromile will use the money to acquire an insurance carrier called Mosaic Insurance to handle the underwriting of its policies itself; as well as to expand new states in the U.S. and continue building its platform.
Preston declined to disclose the company’s valuation with its latest round.
As notable as the size of Metromile’s funding is the list of investors behind it. They include a couple of insurance giants, Canada’s Intact Financial and China Pacific Insurance (CPIC); top VCs Index Ventures, New Enterprise Associates (NEA), First Round Capital, Mitsui and SV Angel; Metromile founder and Chairman David Friedberg (of Climate Corporation fame); and Mark Cuban.
The funding is a surprising and large boost for a company that has been around since 2011 but has seemingly only raised $14 million before now. (And to be clear, the $191.5 million being announced today is actually three rounds rolled into one. CEO Dan Preston tells me it includes a Series D funding of $103.1 million; an additional strategic investment of $50 million from China Pacific Insurance; and a Series C financing from late 2014 that was never made public, of $38.4 million.)
In the interim, Metromile has acquired licenses to operate in all 50 U.S. states although it’s currently only underwriting policies in four: New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Virginia. With the funding, that underwriting will expand to California, Illinois and Washington, and beyond.
“We will start accelerating our state roll out at the beginning of 2017,” Preston said. “For the time being, our focus is on the huge opportunity for per-mile insurance in the US but we’re excited about exploring global opportunities with partners in the future.”
Metromile sells its insurance directly to those who will be using it, but one of the big ways that it can acquire those users is through alliances with others. So far there has been only one of these, with the ridesharing behemoth Uber, which partnered with the startup in 2015 to provide an option for insurance coverage for those times when you are not carrying a passenger (which falls under a different insurance scheme).
Preston says that it’s continuing to work with Uber and the change over to Metromile underwriting all of its own insurance — a result of the Mosaic acquisition — will not impact Uber drivers “for the time being.”
“We are focused on moving our personal business over first. The new claims experience is currently only available for Metromile’s personal policies,” he said. “Uber driver-partner policies will continue to be underwritten by insurers in the National General Insurance Group and their coverage will not be compromised in any way.”
Miles ahead
Metromile has carved out a reputation for disrupting some of the more obvious inefficiencies of the standard insurance business model and the pricing that has been developed around it.
“Sixty-five percent of drivers pay higher premiums to subsidize the minority who drive the most,” Preston explained. The cases where this is perhaps most acute are in cities where people are not entirely dependent to their cars. “Our go to market strategy is focused on large urban areas and aimed at developing a brand with each city that we roll out into. The people who switch to pay-per-mile insurance commute differently. They take multiple forms of public transit, walk, bike or even ride-share to work so a usage based option makes more sense to them.”
While Metromile is tapping into some of the bigger changes that are taking place in the world of transportation, taking on traditional big providers like Geico, Progressive and State Farm, it’s not the only one. There are many of other companies offering pay-as-you-go car insurance right now, including those same huge insurance conglomerates through to startups (some of which have closed due to competition from the large players).
Preston says that the others are different because they use other instruments to measure a driver’s actions to provide a rate.
“What many people call pay as you go insurance is actually behavioral based insurance,” he said. “Metromile is the only multi-state per-mile insurance product and does not rate based on behavior other than miles driven.” Metromile’s model reduces insurance costs for low-mileage drivers by charging based on actual usage of the vehicle. It does this by way of a small wireless device called the Metromile Pulse, which plugs into the diagnostic port of the insured’s vehicle to count the number of miles driven. Drivers are then billed a base rate and a per-mile rate. The company claims that its typical, low-mileage customer can save, on average, $500 per year on insurance.
Preston adds that Metromile’s second differentiator is down to “urbanization and a shifting mindset of millennials.” By this, he means that the less frequent and less regular use of cars by these groups makes per-mile services — which would otherwise work out to be very expensive for more habitual drivers — more appealing.
The third factor that drives users to Metromile is the company’s app. Similar to how many other startups have disrupted their incumbent predecessors, Metromile provides a mobile experience that lets users see and track just how much they are using the insurance and how much they will need to pay. It also has other features like vehicle location, travel data and more.
The changing landscape for transportation will potentially present new opportunities for Metromile in the future.
One area is in connected cars, where you could imagine Metromile being integrated as a built-in option by the automakers: “We have not yet announced any integrations with connected car companies, but are extremely excited about the opportunity,” he told me when I asked about potential partnerships.
Similarly, autonomous and shared-ownership cars — areas that companies like GM, with its Maven initiative, are investing a lot of effort these days — are also targets.
“With multiple types of mixed-use vehicles and autonomous cars, the nature of insurance risk modeling is going to change and insurance companies should aim to adapt to it,” Preston said. “From a consumer perspective, car ownership will continue to be important for people in the US for many years. That said, commuting miles will change because of better public transportation infrastructure and more transportation options which is why pay-per-mile insurance is an important option.”
As we’ve seen in other industries, while Metromile may potentially cut into the business of large insurance companies, it’s also attracting these same competitors as strategic investors, who invest as a hedge against their own existing business.

19,Mercedes-Benz and Matternet unveil vans that launch delivery drones,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/07/mercedes-benz-and-matternet-unveil-vans-that-launch-delivery-drones/,2016/09/07,"Mercedes-Benz Vans and drone tech startup Matternet have created a concept car, or as they’re calling it a Vision Van, that could change the way small packages are delivered across short distances.
The Vision Van’s rooftop serves as a launch and landing pad for Matternet’s new, Matternet M2 drones.
The Matternet M2 drones, which are autonomous, can pick up and carry a package of 4.4 pounds across 12 miles of sky on a single battery charge in real world conditions.
They are designed to reload their payload and swap out batteries without human intervention. They work in conjunction with Mercedes-Benz Vans’ on-board and cloud-based systems so that items within a van are loaded up into the drone, automatically, at the cue of software and with the help of robotic shelving systems within the van.

Matternet designed a hard-shelled case to protect and carry any given cargo. The drone’s payload can transmit data about the contents and destination of a given delivery.
For a logistics company using the Matternet M2 drones or Vision Vans, that data could serve as a kind of proof of delivery, and alert users the instant a package has arrived.
Andreas Raptopoulos, co-founder and CEO of Matternet explained that while all of this sounds and looks like the stuff of sci-fi, the vans with integrated drone technology could be put to immediate good use where regulations allow.
The Vision Van can, for example, launch a Matternet M2 drone with a payload to a final destination that’s not accessible to a van or driver, whether that’s due to traffic in a populated urban area or a lack of safe roads in a more rural or disaster-stricken area.

Or, the drones could fly a package from a distribution center or warehouse to a van so a driver can ultimately take the package down and walk it up to a customer’s doorstep nearby.
A division of Daimler, Mercedes-Benz may be better known for its luxury and sports cars. However, the Mercedes-Benz Vans unit sold 321,000 vehicles in 2015, according to a company financial statement, with popular models in travel and logistics including the Sprinter, Marco Polo, Vito (known as the Metris in the U.S.) and Citan.
According to a company press statement Mercedes-Benz has invested an undisclosed amount in Matternet. According to SEC filings, Matternet has so far raised $9.5 million of a targeted $11.5 million venture funding round.

Raptopolous declined to comment on the filing or the company’s funding status. Executives from Mercedes-Benz Vans were not immediately available for an interview.
Earlier this year, Matternet developed unmanned aircraft systems for UNICEF that are being used to transport blood samples for HIV testing in Malawi. The initiative could speed up the delivery of care to HIV-positive infants across the country where 10,000 children died of HIV-related illnesses in 2014.
