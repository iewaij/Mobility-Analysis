0,Peter Thiel isn’t so sure self-driving tech is a good investment,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/27/peter-thiel-isnt-so-sure-self-driving-tech-is-a-good-investment/,2017/10/27,"
Billionaire investor Peter Thiel doesn’t like investing in trends, he’s fond of saying. It’s a mantra he repeated this week at the Future Investment Initiative, an investment forum in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where he took the stage with journalist Maria Bartiromo.
Asked about where he’s investing, he noted that he’s looking outside of Silicon Valley largely, but he suggested he doesn’t put much stock in “buzzwords” like SaaS software or virtual computing or augmented reality or artificial intelligence. “Even though these trends may or may not happen, as investments, they’re dangerous,” he said. In fact, “when you hear buzzwords, you should run away as fast as you can.” Otherwise, you’re left dealing with “many companies of that kind, and many competitors.”
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Thiel feels the same way about self-driving technologies —  even while his venture firm, Founders Fund, is an investor in the ride-sharing company Lyft, whose future would seem to depend on its ability to become a self-driving company at some point.
Thiel did say, however, that he will make one exception to his own rule. He said he’s willing to look at trends that “aren’t on anybody’s radar.”
In fact, one trend that he suggested is hiding in plain sight and merits far more attention than it receives today — perhaps because it’s simply less sexy than self-driving cars or flying taxis — is good-old telecommuting and how its inevitable rise will change the landscape.
Indeed, asked about the future of transportation, Thiel seemed to suggest there might not be much need for it, at least, not by individuals needing to get to their jobs.
Said Thiel:

Certainly, just the shift to companies like Uber or Lyft, which I’m invested in, is itself a big change. The self-driving car trend is an important trend for the economy; it will change consumer behavior tremendously. If you had self-driving cars, you could have a longer commute because you could work in the car.
I’m not sure it’s a good investment [emphasis ours], because there are a lot of companies doing similar technologies in self-driving cars and it’s hard to know how differentiated they are.
The transportation-related technology that I wonder about more than self-driving cars is, is there some way to do an end run around our broken transportation systems, and the IT version that people have talked about for decades is telecommuting.
So, will there be some way that you won’t need transportation at all, and you can just do your work remotely? For a variety of reasons, this hasn’t worked for the last 30 to 40 years and it hasn’t worked for one reason or another [including concerns that] when people work from home, they don’t work as hard, that a lot of the value of work comes from talking with people.
But I think we’re starting to see more of this telecommuting in Silicon Valley and elsewhere, where people are finding small teams of developers outside of Silicon Valley. There are ways to allocate the work to different people.
So . . . telecommuting, that’s a trend that’s worth exploring a lot more, that’s underrated.

Funding of car technology-related startups reached an all-time high of $1.6 billion during the first half of this year, according to data from CB Insights.
You can check out more of Thiel’s chat with Bartiromo here.
Unfortunately — and possibly as a condition of his appearance — there was no talk about his work with the Trump administration, his continued involvement with which has kept Thiel in the headlines for much of 2017.

1,Waymo to start testing its self-driving cars in Michigan,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/26/waymo-to-start-testing-its-self-driving-cars-in-michigan/,2017/10/26,"
Waymo’s next stop for its self-driving Chrysler Pacifica test vehicles is Michigan. The company that sprung from Google’s self-driving car project will be deploying its autonomous cars just in time for Michigan’s winter, too, which will mean that they should encounter a range of major challenges, including snow, sleet and frozen roads.
This isn’t the first time Waymo has brought its vehicles to snowy conditions: It’s done some testing near Lake Tahoe to see how its cars would perform in more wintery environs,. But putting some of its Pacifica fleet to the test in Michigan is a different story, and will involve likely more rigorous and consistent testing.
Waymo previously opened a dedicated development center for its self-driving tech in Novi, Michigan, but this makes the first time it’ll be testing its vehicles in the state on pubic roads, and builds on its existing work there to develop tech along with partners.
The testing will begin in the Greater Detroit area, starting with Novi, in the next few weeks, and all vehicles will have trained safety drivers on board like the rest of Waymo’s testing fleet.
Winter testing is not new for Waymo, which has been running trials in cold conditions since 2012, but having a fleet in operation in dedicated winter conditions in Michigan will be a huge boon to its ability to ensure its tech is not only ready to deliver autonomy on winter roads, but also to make sure its tech stack and hardware are ready to last over time in harsher conditions.

2,Daimler’s new electric heavy-duty truck has 220 miles of range,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/25/daimlers-new-electric-heavy-duty-truck-has-220-miles-of-range/,2017/10/25,"
Daimler has a new all-electric semi truck that it revealed at this year’s Tokyo Motor Show, with a range of around 220 miles on a single charge and a heavy-duty towing capacity of around 11 tons, or just two tons less than its diesel equivalent.
The Vision One packs in batteries with storage capacity of up to 300 kilowatt hours, and that 220 miles of range allow for short haul trips between relatively closely spaced cities – not suitable for long haul, of focuses, but more flexible in terms of carrying large loads over medium distances.
The E-FUSO brand is also a new sub-brand of Daimler’s Mitsubishi trucking unit, which will lie alongside FUSO but focus on its all-electric ambitions and aim of delivering a purely electric version of all the trucks across its range. Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus co. notes that it’s the first vehicle maker of its kind to have a brand dedicated to EV buses and trucks.
This truck debut comes after FUSO has started to deploy its eCanter light duty truck to its first commercial customers, and just ahead of the debut of a Tesla’s electric heavy-duty transport truck, which is set to be unveiled next month at a special event.
Tesla’s truck is reported to have a range of between 200 and 300 miles, which could put it right tin line with the new E-FUSO Vision One. This is definitely a shot across the bow of Tesla’s trucking ambitions, though we’ll have to see what Elon Musk’s company will be demonstrating in terms of additional features, including perhaps autonomous capabilities, that it thinks will set its offering apart.

3,Nissan’s IMx electric concept car wants to get to know you,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/25/nissans-imx-concept-electric-concept-car-wants-to-get-to-know-you/,2017/10/25,"
Nissan’s latest electric vehicle concept aims for crossover appeal, with a design that goes well beyond the Nissan Leaf in terms of aggressive styling and visual appeal. The IMx also focuses on self-driving technologies, and on learning a user’s preferences and providing them with a wraparound informatics display that incorporates its learnings about its user.
The IMx design has been conceived to communicate its electric underpinnings on the outside, and it’s a look that was conceived based on taking inspiration from Japanese swords, and also from ‘washi,’ or Japanese paper that’s made for subtly and durability with a painstaking multi-step creation process.

It’s definitely an attractive car, with a full glass roof and sleek narrow headlights, and an interior with wood trim that lend to the sense of open interior space made possible by the extra room made available through use of the electric drivetrain. The suicide doors and lack of a B pillar further add to that sense of expansive, usable space.

The Nissan IMx also has a range of smart features on board, including the ability to engage Nissan’s self-driving ProPILOT system, which takes over driving duties. This includes some neat additional features like a retracting steering wheel and brake and gas pedal, which descend into the dashboard and the floor respectively to provide more room for the driver to relax comfortably.

Nissan’s latest concept car also features a wraparound display that provides live information around the driver and passengers in the cockpit, just below the windshield and passenger windows. The screen will provide info like navigation data, as well as suggestions about what they might like to do, extrapolating that information based on past trip data.
Nissan told me that it’s working with partners on its in-vehicle smart assistant, but it wouldn’t articulate which partners it’s using specifically. It also hinted that the assistant might be able to follow the driver beyond the vehicle throughout their daily life.

The car’s interface use cameras placed throughout the vehicle and artificial intelligence to interpret user commands and anticipate their needs, with the intend of minimizing manual controls and other potential distractions.
Nissan says that while this is just a concept, it’s still intended to reflect the actual direction of their efforts around ‘Intelligent Mobility’ and its productization.

4,Toyota sees traditional gas engines phased out of its line by the 2040s,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/25/toyota-sees-traditional-gas-engines-phased-out-of-its-line-by-the-2040s/,2017/10/25,"
Toyota sees dedicated gas and diesel engines in its vehicles lineup reducing to zero by the 2040s, on its path to its goal of reducing the CO2 emissions of its vehicles by 90 percent by 2050 (compared to 2010). At a press conference hosted by the company at the 2017 Tokyo Motor Show today, Toyota’s Chief Safety Technology Officer Kiyotaka Ise noted that this is their anticipated time frame for ending the production of gas and diesel cars.
The timeline is close to the target dates mentioned by some other companies, and matches up with the ban targets set by a number of countries, including France and the U.K., with China also announcing plans to set a timeline for the end of purely internal combustion engine vehicles.
This doesn’t mean that Toyota will sell only electric vehicles from the 2040s on — the company has been one of the slowest movers among automakers when it comes to building purely electric cars, and it has repeatedly said that it believes the best strategy is to embrace a range of powertrain options, including fuel cell and hybrid vehicles, to suit the needs of different markets around the world.
Internal combustion tech will still be used from the 2040s on, Ise said, via hybrid engines, but the use of purely ICE drivetrains won’t make sense after this date given the company’s aggressive emissions targets and the progress of its technology in hybrid powertrain options.

5,Toyota’s Concept-i Walk offers rolling personal mobility,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/25/toyotas-concept-i-walk-offers-rolling-personal-mobility/,2017/10/25,"
Toyota’s thinking outside the car with one of two new Concept-i vehicles it revealed at the Tokyo Motor Show this year. The Concept-i Walk is a sidewalk mobility device that takes up the same physical space as a person walking and that can anticipate and avoid collisions automatically.
It looks sort of like a scaled-down Segway, but it’s designed for easy operation for anyone using a single joystick for navigation and acceleration. As mentioned, it occupies no more space than a single pedestrian, which means it should be easy to use in real-world settings now, without any requirements in terms of changing behavior to accommodate the new transportation mode.

The Concept-i Walk has a slim body, culminating in the integrated control joystick, which is ergonomically designed to work with the human body. When the vehicle detects danger using its on-board sensors, it provides an alert and then automatically avoids whatever it sees, including things like a child darting out in front of its path, for instance.
The total width of the base is less than a person’s shoulder width, and its length front-to-back is less than a person’s average stride — so it takes up less space than a person walking, Toyota says. And unlike vehicles like the Segway, there’s no body weight shifting required, with steering designed around that single handle, which is positioned at about stomach height so it can be used in a relaxed position by the rider.
All a driver needs to do is lightly flex their wrist right or left to make turns, as it’s designed to work with limited arm mobility for greater accessibility.
The vehicle has three wheels for stability when stopping, and the wheelbase is variable to provide stability at multiple speeds. Toyota’s Yui personal AI agent is here, too, carrying the assistant across the Concept-i line, which includes the original concept vehicle revealed at CES this year, and now the Walk and the Ride, too.

Yui on the Concept-i Walk has a projector built-in for visual communication, allowing it to project contextual information on shop windows for instance, and speakers for voice communication.
Its total cruising range on a single charge is around 6 to 12 miles, and Toyota is aiming to have it weigh around 44 pounds, which is relatively portable for a personal vehicle like this. It’ll have a maximum speed of around 4 miles per hour, as it’s designed to work with the existing flow of pedestrian traffic.
This concept reflects a growing interest at Toyota to work on solutions across personal mobility, and to unlock freedom of movement for groups including seniors that traditionally have had problems with this. It’s still just a concept, but Toyota seems committed to exploring mobility at all levels, and also to designing an assistant experience that follows the user across each part of that journey.

6,Toyota’s new Concept-i Ride is your tiny automotive friend about town,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/25/toyotas-new-concept-i-ride-is-your-tiny-automotive-friend-about-town/,2017/10/25,"
Toyota unveiled two new members of its Concept-i series at the Tokyo Motor Show this year, including the new Concept-i Ride, designed for in-city transportation and equipped with user-friendly functions intended specifically for wheelchair users. The i-Ride is tailor-made for universal, shared mobility per the automaker.
It’s a quite compact vehicle, which Toyota says makes it very easy to park in dense urban areas. It also means wheelchair users do not need to look for wheelchair specific spots, and are still able to get into and out of the car in normally sized spaces according to Toyota.
The vehicle features wraparound large window, which allow for a wide view of the road, and therefore peace of mind for the user, per the carmaker.
Currently, it’s also hard to get wheelchairs into a car, and the process could get clothes dirty since you’re basically dragging the wheelchair across your body into the passenger side. This concept mode lifts the wheelchair up using the power door, and then you can pull It into the vehicle next to the seat towards the back of the cabin, without taking up crucial driver cabin space.
The car is also equipped with a power seat to address the issues wheelchair users have with entering the vehicle by providing ample range of motion.

The driver’s seat slides from side to side and raises and lowers to minimize the gap between curb nd car, and to allow easiest possible entry for wheelchair users.
The Concept-I Ride positions that driver’s at the center of the front of the car, hopefully making for a more pleasant and less distracted driving experience, with easier to judge positioning of the car since there are equal distances between yourself and either side of the vehicle.
Also, when there’s a need to carry a passenger, the passenger seat is arranged diagonally behind the driver seat for maximum spacial feel, and without changing the positioning of that center-sat driver seat.

To drive the vehicle, the Concept-i Ride does not use a steering wheel, but instead uses a joystick instead on the armrest. if you shift the controller forward the car will move forward, and likewise for backwards, right and left – there are no pedals for acceleration and gas, since it’s all done via the joysticks.
Concept-i Ride will have Toyota’s Yui AI agent on board, and incorporated into the front panel. Yui, which first debuted at CES with the original i-Concept, creates relationships with the driver. also the agent follows the driver across vehicles, so it’ perfect fit for cars like this one, given how focused it is on providing the building blocks for car sharing service models.
This vehicle is designed to be fully electric with a total range of between 100 and 150 km, or up to 93 miles on a single charge. That’s not industry leading by any means, but it should work well for those in an urban environment looking for a car they can use to run errands locally and occasionally take short day trips.
Toyota hopes to field the Concept-i series by around 2020, starting with a version of the car it debuted at CES.

7,Uber focuses on Earnings improvements in latest driver-side changes,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/24/uber-focuses-on-earnings-improvements-in-latest-driver-side-changes/,2017/10/24,"
Uber has modified some of the core ways earnings work for its drivers, as the latest chapter in its ongoing ‘180 Days of Change’ program. Uber debuted its 180 Days campaign earlier this year, with the long-awaited introduction of in-app tipping for drivers, and it has subsequently rolled out a range of other features, as well.
These changes to earnings continue the theme of adding features that Uber hopes will increase driver satisfaction and retention, both of which it has had challenges with in the past. Earnings is an area that could have a tremendous impact on satisfaction, for obvious reasons, and all of these changes focus on delivering higher earning capacity for drivers across most types of rides.
Drivers will now begin earning more for long pickups, with a special additional fee that applies when they have to travel a longer distance with a longer ETA to collect a rider. Uber suggests this will help on the driver side by incentivizing drivers to accept rides when they see long pickup ETAs.
Drivers will also be able to earn more from late cancellations, specifically around long pickups with last-minute cancellations. Drivers will earn either the standard cancellation fee, or a distance and time fee for the long pickup fee, whichever is greater, whenever these cancellations occur.
Another area where drivers currently lose out is around longer wait times, and starting now they’ll earn more on a per minute basis after the initial two minutes whenever a rider makes them wait for a pickup.
Finally, Uber is going to start incorporating tolls directly into fares, which will mean that drivers don’t have to pick up the bill when it comes to fares that involved driving across tolled routes.

8,Singapore to cap number of cars allowed on roads from 2018,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/23/singapore-to-cap-number-of-cars-allowed-on-roads-from-2018/,2017/10/23,"
Cars congesting roads is a problem in just about every major urban center around the world, but some areas are worst in this regard than others. Singapore is one of those, and it’s going to do something about it – the government there has announced that it will cut the annual growth rate of cars and motorcycles allowed on roads in the country from 0.25 percent to zero starting next February.
The zero growth rate is something that Singapore essentially has to do – it spans a smaller total area than New York City, as Bloomberg notes, and yet it has given over 12 percent of its total land area to roads thus far. The decision to cap new cars on the road is due to there just not being enough land for more road expansion.
This new cap doesn’t apply to transport vehicles for goods and buses, which will continue to be able to grow at 0.25 percent per year through at least 2021. It’ll also revisit the cap for all vehicles in 2025.
Singapore isn’t alone in facing the challenge of there just being too many cars on the road, and too many demands on infrastructure as a result. But it is a particularly poignant example of what happens when that reaches a crisis point, and a good sample case to look to to see why there’s such a focus on mobility services and alternative transportation services particularly for dense urban environments.

9,Chariot resumes shuttle service in SF today,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/23/chariot-resumes-shuttle-service-in-sf-today/,2017/10/23,"
Chariot, the commuter shuttle service that had to halt rides in San Francisco last week, is resuming operations this afternoon. Last week, the California Public Utilities Commission suspended Chariot’s operating permit after the service didn’t pass three consecutive California Highway Patrol inspections.
On Friday, the CHP re-inspected Chariot and the company “passed all inspections,” Chariot CEO Ali Vahabzadeh wrote in an email to customers today. He added that Chariot is “in compliance with all regulations” and does not “expect any future interruptions.”
Three CHP inspections before Friday found there were Chariot drivers who did not have valid Class B California driver licenses. In order to drive passenger buses, Chariot operators need to have Class B licenses.
“This resulted in an unsatisfactory rating for each inspection,” CHP Public Information Officer John D. Fransen told TechCrunch last week. “The carrier was advised that continued unsatisfactory ratings would result in denial, suspension, or revocation of the carriers California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) operating authority.”
Here’s the full email Chariot CEO Ali Vahabzadeh sent to customers today:

We’re happy to share that effective Monday afternoon, service will be back on and running as regularly scheduled. We’ve resolved the situation and do not expect any future interruptions. Thank you so much for your patience, and for all your support during this time. 
From our brand new and monthly-serviced vehicles, to our employee drivers who undergo extensive training, we take our commitment to safety very seriously and know you trust us daily with your commute. We passed all inspections on Friday as expected and continue to be in compliance with all regulations.
Thanks again for being a loyal Chariot rider and helping us become the best way to commute in SF. See you on the road this afternoon!

10,Lyft hires Katie Dill as VP of Design,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/23/lyft-hires-katie-dill-as-vp-of-design/,2017/10/23,"
Lyft has hired Katie Dill as its new Vice President of Design, overseeing design in a broad sense across the company, covering user experience, product and more. Dill joins from Airbnb, where she was Director of Experience and helped usher in the peer-to-peer rental business’s new brand identity.
Prior to her time at Airbnb, Dill was a Creative Director at renowned firm frog design in San Francisco. She came to design in a somewhat roundabout way, she told me in an interview, having started off in college with a Bachelor’s degree in History.
“I grew up on the East coast knowing very little about design, and graduated from college still not having even heard of it,“ Dill told me in an interview. “I learned about the actual practices of design, and it being a profession through the IDEO ‘making a shopping cart’ video. A good friend of mine knew about the little inventions I wold make around the house, saw the video and thought ‘hey this might be a good fit for your.’”
Dill’s background might not have been in design, but she was naturally driven to create solutions to problems by inventing or modifying her own tools and devices – she realized this could be a career path and moved across the country to study industrial design to make it happen.
Eventually, she ended up at Airbnb at a pivotal time for the company. The peer-to-peer lodging startup was just coming in to its own, moving from a period of hyper growth to one of maturation as a brand and as a business, and part of that maturation process was developing a new brand ID and guiding design principles to move it into its next phase.
Dill thinks that her experience at Airbnb should offer a lot of crossover for her role at Lyft. Both are hospitality businesses, she says (and Lyft co-founder John Zimmer’s background in hospitality truly shows in Lyft’s approach, according to Dill), and. both are double-sided marketplaces where the key to good design is balancing the experience of both service providers and service users.
“The similarities are that Lyft is working at building a service that goes into the online and the offline worlds, it develops a community, and it’s helping to leverage hospitality to make an experience great,” she explained. “It’s growing rapidly, too – earlier this year, only half the U.S. had access to Lyft and now it’s 95 percent. That kind of rapid growth certainly has lots of potential, but also has lots of challenges.”
Ultimately, the carry-over skills and experience from her time at Airbnb are core to what she’ll be doing at Lyft, as well.
“I’m familiar with building a community between strangers and developing trust between strangers,” Dill said. “I’m familiar with developing a service that in many ways equipped a community to deliver that service, as opposed to it being delivered first and foremost by employees.”
I asked Dill about how she views Lyft’s autonomous driving ambitions, and whether that will impact her job from a design perspective. She said that it all ties in to the core hospitality goals of the company, as a service provider and a platform on which others can offer their own services.
“John Zimmer’s background in hospitality is one of the things that inspired me most about Lyft in chatting with the team. Seeing how the company has brought that into everything they’ve done has been really inspiring. It’s more than just a ride, it’s more than transportation – they really are building a community and ensuring that experiences are great through that lens and that absolutely will hold true with autonomous as well.”

11,Lyft raises $1 billion at $11 billion valuation led by Alphabet’s CapitalG,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/19/lyft-raises-1-billion-at-11-billion-valuation-led-by-alphabets-capitalg/,2017/10/19,"
Ride-hailing company Lyft has raised a new $1 billion funding round, putting its post-money valuation at $11 billion total. The round was led by Alphabet’s CapitalG, its growth-focused investment fund, and CapitalG partner David Lawee will join Lyft’s board as part of the transaction.
Lyft shared the news in an official blog post, and noted that it has run over 500 million rides to date, and expanded its coverage in the U.S. to 95 percent of the population, which is up from just 54 percent at the start of 2017.
Lyft raised $600 million at a $7.5 billion valuation in April this year, with investment from new partners including Canada’s public employee pension fund. The company was reported to be raising a new $1 billion round, with Alphabet involved, back in September.
Alphabet’s GV early investment fund was an early Uber backer, which makes this more interesting. But relations between Uber and Google’s parent company have likely soured in general now that Alphabet’s Waymo self-driving company is engaged in an ongoing legal battle with Uber over allegedly stolen trade secrets regarding LiDAR tech.
Lyft has a self-driving partnership in place with Waymo, too – the company announced the alliance back in May, around its open platform for autonomous vehicle technology.

Toyota is debuting a new concept vehicle for the forthcoming Tokyo Motor Show, and it’s a fuel cell vehicle that’s designed to get around 1,000 km (around 621 miles) on a single hydrogen pack that can be refuelled in about 3 minutes total. The concept looks like an aggressively future-styled minivan, though it’s billed as a “premium saloon,” and it’s got an interior design that emphasizes second row seating space.
The Fine-Comfort Ride is designed to be flexible in its seat configuration, so that it can use used maximally by just one occupant, or rather as a meeting or communication and collaboration room for a group.

It’s also got a virtual Agent built into touch displays on the driver and passenger windows and screens, for a full surround infotainment experience. The motors are in the wheels, positioned at the absolute outside edges of the car, too, which Toyota says makes for silent running and quite operation.
There are also no dividing pillars separating the front and rear seats, and the bucket seating looks like lounge furnishings from a Blade Runner movie. It’s actually a super cool vision of future mobility, albeit probably not a particularly realistic one.
Toyota should have plenty more to show off at the Tokyo Motor Show next week, so stay tuned for more big reveals, and hopefully more far-out concepts.

When one self-driving technology entrepreneur highlights the efforts of another company working on autonomous vehicles, you pay attention: That’s what happened with Voyage co-founder MacCallister Higgins, who tweeted a short video of the top of Apple’s ‘Project Titan’ test Lexus SUV, outfitted with a suite of sensors and autonomous hardware.
This isn’t the first time we’ve seen the car and its roof array, but it’s probably the best up-close look at it we’ve had, and it’s also being seen through expert eyes instead of through those of nearby residents who happen upon one in the wild. Higgins says, for instance, that the large rooftop assembly probably actually contains “the majority of the compute stack,” as opposed to having that stuffed in the trunk like it is in many other vehicles.


Going to need more than 140 characters to go over 🍎's Project Titan. I call it ""The Thing"" pic.twitter.com/sLDJd7iYSa
— MacCallister Higgins (@macjshiggins) October 17, 2017



Higgins also said that the front and back both have 6 LiDARS, and an observer noted that putting the radar array on the roof is also an interesting choice.
The benefit of this design might be that it’s relatively plug-and-play, requiring very little in the way of in-vehicle modifications, beyond bolting the roof rack to the vehicle. That would also make it easy to switch test cars theoretically in the future, and it could have an impact product-wise in terms of gearing towards modularity in design so that this can be adapted to many purposes and vehicles as an aftermarket add-on.

The cars have 70 miles of pure EV range on their built-in battery pack, but can also go up to 400 miles using the onboard gas engine to generate the power for the battery and motor.
The vehicles meet the conditions for London’s forthcoming requirement that all new taxis on roads be technically “zero emission capable” as of the start of January, 2018. The taxis also feature a number of onboard convenience features and other tech add-ons, including built-in Wi-Fi, USB chargers, a panoramic roof and six seats, plus contactless terminals for accepting tap cards and mobile payments.
This is still a car that will probably spend a lot of time guzzling gas, considering its range and the amount of travel that drivers normally do during a day in the city. But it’s a far greener alternative compared to what’s used now, and it has the potential to get better over time.

15,Amazon patents a drone that delivers a charge to power up EVs on the go,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/17/amazon-patents-a-drone-that-delivers-a-charge-to-power-up-evs-on-the-go/,2017/10/17,"
A recent Amazon patent could be an answer to range anxiety, albeit one that sounds a bit more sci-fi than practical solution at the moment: the newly granted patent (via Roadshow) describes a drone that could carry a battery charge for electric cars, and deliver them to any cars out on the road that need them while in route, providing enough juice to get to a proper charging station.
There’s a lot that seems crazy about this patent, however – including the fact that drones themselves require a lot of tricky power management to get even limited flight times with lightweight cargo on board. Keeping themselves charged and within range of vehicles in need of a top-up might be the most challenging aspect of the idea overall, in fact.
It’s not the only hurdle in terms of making this thing real, either; the patent also describes a rooftop docking station that the drone can land on to stay connected with the vehicle and provide power on an ongoing basis while it continues along its route. That means either aftermarket modifications or buy-in from automakers will be required to make it happen, too.
At the moment, it’s not a super realistic concept, in other words. But it has potential, especially if we get to a future where EVs are commonplace, as are drone delivery services (something Amazon definitely is interested in making happen).

Amazon and Garmin have teamed up to bring the wisdom and subservient attitude of Alexa to a car near you.
The Garmin Speak is an Echo Dot-like device that sits in the dash of your car and brings the full range of Alexa skills into the car. What’s more, the Garmin Speak integrates Alexa services through the car stereo, meaning you can listen to music, audiobooks, news and weather through a full-fledged sound system (comparatively) instead of tiny speaker.
You can also use Garmin’s turn-by-turn navigation by simply saying “Alexa, ask Garmin.”
What’s more, users will be able to place orders on Amazon and control their smart devices at home through the Garmin Speak. So if, for example, you forgot to turn off the lights or lock the door (and you have the smart home accessories capable of doing that for you), you can simply take care of it from the driver’s seat.

The Garmin Speak will use data from your smartphone, once you download the free Garmin Speak app, through a connection via Bluetooth or AUX cord.
There are plenty of smart assistant services out there for drivers, including CarPlay, Google Android Auto, Alexa herself, and Cortana, some of which are integrated at the OEM level.
Garmin Speak is available now for $150 here.

17,Cruise’s self-driving Chevrolet Bolts are coming to New York next year,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/17/cruises-self-driving-chevrolet-bolts-are-coming-to-new-york-next-year/,2017/10/17,"
GM’s Cruise Automation will expand its test pool, while keeping a focus on city driving, something it has said gives it an edge in the autonomous driving space. What better city to use for testing, then, than New York, one of the densest and most hectic traffic nightmares in North America.
Cruise will test its self-driving fleet in New York in a five-mile square section of Manhattan, the company announced led via the WSJ, in a move that will also make it the first automaker to test autonomous vehicles in the city. Each will have a safety driver on board, as they do in the current San Francisco test, but now they’ll be tackling inclement four-season weather, as well as other drivers and pedestrians who are less laid back than their west coast counterparts.
Alongside the pilot deployment, Cruise will also be operating a new research center in the city, likely because it doesn’t make much sense to round trip the data back to its offices in San Francisco. No word yet on timeframes for consumer-facing deployment, but as Cruise’s testing in NYC proceeds, it seems likely the GM subsidiary will replicate its staff-facing prototype on-demand autonomous pick up service in Manhattan, too.
Cruise recently explained that it believes its testing in city environments provides much more useful data in terms of helping teach its autonomous driving systems, vs. testing in suburban areas, like the Arizona pilot location for Waymo’s on-demand ride hailing trial. I’d expect more major cities to become testing targets for Cruise as capacity and local regulators allow, then, since it seems like GM will aim to deploy and future consumer self-driving services in those areas first.

Mercedes-Benz Arocs trucks are an autonomous means to an end: The industrial vehicles can work without drivers, and without requiring a bevy of expensive sensors equipped on the truck itself. The service vehicles work by following the leader, along GPS mapped routes, providing high accuracy from a lead vehicle with control over the followers.
The Arocs version of autonomous transportation also builds emergency safety measures into each, allowing for hazard management. It’s designed for circumscribed areas, too, which make it more practical to achieve in the near-term vs. ambitious self-driving projects like free driving on real-world roads.
Their Arocs in the video are networked via encrypted radio transmission, with a full control panel in the lead vehicle. Each truck is interchangeable, meaning they can all act as the lead in a pinch, and each follows not only the leader but a strictly laid out and mapped path to coordinate their efforts, which in this case focus on show removal at an airfield.

There are a range of truck-based operations that involve covering a pre-defined route repeatedly in essentially the same fashion over and over, with only minor allowances needed for basic safety, like being able to identify and stop if a hazard is in the way. You can imagine luggage carts, waste disposal, on-campus mail delivery and more using similar setups, as well as industrial scale grass cutters and other landscaping vehicles.

19,Uber-SoftBank deal “very likely” to be finalized in the next week,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/16/uber-softbank-deal-very-likely-to-be-finalized-in-the-next-week/,2017/10/16,"
The Uber-SoftBank deal is almost done, said Arianna Huffington on stage at WSJ D.Live in Laguna Beach on Monday. When pressed whether SoftBank’s multi-billion dollar investment in Uber could be finalized within the week, the Uber board member replied that it’s “very likely.”
She confirmed media reports that the proposed deal would involve both a direct investment in the company at the last private valuation and also a secondary transaction, buying out existing shareholders at a yet-to-be-determined discount.
Uber is still “waiting on what’s going to transpire in terms of the price,” said Huffington.
She added that having SoftBank “on your cap table is very important when they’re also investing in so many of our competitors around the world.” Implying that there could be more acquisitions in ridesharing, she said to “expect to see some consolidation.”
Huffington also spoke about the difficult period Uber has faced in the past few months. The company’s work environment had come under fire, leading to the departure of several key executives, including co-founder and CEO Travis Kalanick.
“If your culture is so driven by growth at the expense of other things, there are consequences,” said Huffington. “Culture, we’re now recognizing, is the immune system of a company.”
She voiced optimism about Uber’s new leader, Dara Khosrowshahi. Calling him “unflappable,” she said that there’s a renewed focus on image. His “goal is to get people to love the company and not just the product.”
Huffington also said that Khosrowshahi has a greater focus on cost-cutting, in order to meet the goal of taking Uber public by 2019.

Baidu, China’s internet technology giant, hopes to be in the business of mass producing autonomous cars by 2021, thanks to a partnership with BAIC Group, a Chinese automaker which will handle the manufacturing part of that equation. BAIC Group is one of Baidu’s many partners for its Apollo autonomous driving program, and it’ll use the open platform to produce vehicles with Level 3 autonomous features by 2019 before moving on to fully self-driving Level 4 cars by 2021, the companies announced today.
Baidu will contribute cybersecurity, image recognition and self-driving, as well as its DuerOS virtual assistant capabilities, and BAIC will integrate those technologies into its own vehicles. The two anticipate that by 2019, more than 1 million of BAIC’s production vehicles will feature Baidu networking tech, and the companies will be working on building out an automotive cloud-based ecosystem of products and services, too, including crowd-sourced traffic info and more.
Just last month, GM announced that it would be mass producing its own self-driving vehicles with subsidiary Cruise Automation. The GM large volume autonomous car is based on the Bolt platform, but features more integrated self-driving sensors and computing technology designed to be produced at scale.

21,"New Tesla voluntary recall applies to 11,000 Model X vehicles",https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/12/new-tesla-voluntary-recall-applies-to-11000-model-x-vehicles/,2017/10/12,"
Tesla is taking a “proactive measure” out of an “abundance of caution,” the company says, in handling an issue with a cable used in the adjusting of second-row seating in a small percent of Model X vehicles. The automaker has issued a voluntary recall, which will apply to 11,000 Model X vehicles it would like to inspect — though it believes only 3 percent of those cars actually exhibit the issue.
The problem was discovered via internal testing, per Tesla, and basically involves the cable that controls the reclining of the two rear seats being too tight in some vehicles, which means that when the seats are folded back up from a flat position, they might not fully lock in place again. This could theoretically result in problems if adults are in the seats in case of an accident, though Tesla says that they haven’t seen anything related to this issue in the field, or in any customer car as of yet.
Tesla will be emailing customers with affected models today, and will be arranging service appointments. Both 2016 and 2017 Model X vehicles were affected, but the good news is that Tesla says that even if it finds a vehicle has the problem, no additional parts are required and the fix takes only about 10 minutes.
The carmaker also says it can actually address the recall entirely using its global mobile service fleet, meaning that no one should have to technically go into a service location to get it fixed. Tesla says that it’s currently managing as much as 30 percent of its repairs in some markets using the mobile service option, and that it has done 40 percent of the Takata airbag recall servicing it handled in the last month via this method.
A Tesla spokesperson provided the following statement to TechCrunch regarding the Model X recall:

Tesla is taking a proactive action to ensure the safety of some of Model X owners who may need an adjustment to their second row seat. Model X has received the highest rating in every category and subcategory in independent safety tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and we continue to conduct our own internal testing to ensure that Model X remains the safest SUV in the world.

During recent internal testing, Tesla determined that a small number of cables in the second row fold-flat seats in some 2016 and 2017 Model X vehicles may need to be adjusted. Although Tesla has not received reports of any issues or accidents relating to this condition, we will be conducting a voluntary recall to inspect the affected vehicles and confirm whether any adjustment is needed. Although we have never seen any incidence of it in the field, internal testing has indicated that if the cable is not properly adjusted, the seat back on the left side of the second row seats could move forward during a crash.

Tesla will be utilizing its mobile repair service to conduct repairs as a part of this recall – we can address 100% of these repairs via mobile service, and customers will have the choice to do that or to bring their car into a Service Center. In the past two months, we have conducted roughly 40% of the Takata airbag recall repairs via mobile service, and customer satisfaction results for our mobile service offering are consistently above 97%.

22,CarGurus spikes 72% in auto marketplace IPO,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/12/cargurus-spikes-72-in-auto-marketplace-ipo/,2017/10/12,"
Used-car marketplace CarGurus spiked more than 72 percent during its first day of trading.
The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company had raised more than $150 million after pricing its IPO at $16. By the end of trading Thursday, shares had gone up more than 72 percent, closing at $27.58.
In a conversation earlier this morning with CarGurus CFO Jason Trevisan, he claimed that the business has become “the largest platform for both consumers and dealers to find a car.” He said that CarGurus has managed to sign up moe than 40,000 dealers on the platform, or more than 90 percent of the auto dealership businesses in the U.S.
CarGurus does not make money per transaction. Instead, it’s a freemium model, with dealers paying for full functionality of the CarGurus platform.
The company also has been building out its peer-to-peer marketplace, which does not currently generate revenue. Eventually, Trevisan says that the company will sell transaction-related services like escrow, warranty or financing.
In addition to traditional car dealerships, CarGurus competes with TrueCar, Cars.com and AutoTrader.com. TrueCar initially struggled following its 2014 IPO, but turned things around two years ago.
Trevisan said CarGurus, which was founded in 2006, was able to shun traditional venture financing because the company was cash-flow positive early on. He said that the business launched with just $4 million in funding from friends and family, but eventually raised money from mutual funds.
Revenue last year was $198.1 million. The company brought in $6.5 million in profit. This compares to $98.6 million in revenue and losses of $1.6 million in 2015.
The largest shareholders are Argonaut 22, T. Rowe Price and Allen & Co.
CarGurus hopes to use the proceeds from the IPO to further expand internationally, adding markets beyond Canada, U.K and Germany. The company also plans to do a bit of hiring, with a particular focus on developers and engineers.
The company listed on the Nasdaq.

23,Waymo releases its first self-driving ‘Safety Report’,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/12/waymo-self-driving-safety-report/,2017/10/12,"
Waymo launched a campaign earlier this week alongside partners, including the National Safety Council, to help explain why it believes that its pursuit of autonomous driving is a means to safer roads. Now it’s releasing its first-ever Safety Report, which offers more detail on the procedures and technology it uses to ensure safety in deploying its autonomous fleet.
The 42-page document includes a summary overview of how Waymo’s cars function at a basic level, including under what conditions they work (and are designed to work exclusively) and how they “fail” back to a safe stop as a final fallback. It also explains what happens after a crash, should there be one, and what kind of data is recorded, as well as what measures are taken in terms of cybersecurity on the Waymo vehicles.
Waymo also details both its hardware and software testing processes, including crash avoidance and the overall durability of its sensors and other equipment. Finally, it spells out how a rider experiences driving in its cars, and how the technology works in the case of interacting with emergency vehicles, law enforcement and other first responders.

The document kicks off with a series of facts and figures designed to impress upon the reader the need for autonomous driving, and its potential impact in terms of making roads safer (94 percent of U.S. accidents were human-caused, for instance), economics ($594 billion in costs related to accidental death and injuries per year) and mobility (79 percent of Americans 65 and older live in communities that require cars to get around, basically).
Waymo also breaks down the five basic categories it uses for defining “safety” relative to its autonomous vehicles, including behavioral safety (driving decision on the road), functional safety (safe operation, including backups and redundancies), crash safety (ability to protect people within the car), operational safety (safety and comfort in interaction between passenger and car) and non-collision safety (safety for anyone interacting with the vehicle in any capacity, basically).
The report also details the sensor system, explaining what each does, and covers LiDAR, vision and radar — as well as supplemental sensors, including microphones to pick up emergency vehicles and other road noises.
Crucially, it also explains the “operational design domain” that Waymo uses to define where and when its vehicles can safely operate. This encompasses a range of factors needed for safe driving, including geographies, types of roads, range of speed, time of day, regulatory requirements and even weather.
The full Safety Report is embedded in its entirety below, and I recommend reading it if you’re at all interested in AV tech. It’s not only a good indication that Waymo does as it has always said and takes safety very seriously, but it’s also a comprehensive look at the company’s approach to self-driving as a whole, if a bit surface-level for experts in the field.

LG is opening Europe’s largest factory for building lithium-ion batteries destined for use in electric cars, the company announced. Its LG Chem division is going to open the doors for the facility in 2019 in Poland near Wroclaw, per Reuters, and the facility will be able to supply as many as 100,000 EV batteries per year beginning next year.
For comparison, Panasonic’s latest battery facility in China can make enough to supply the production of around 200,000 vehicles per year, and the Gigafactory hopes to eventually produce enough for around 500,000 vehicles per year. The Gigafactory at its current capacity, which is nowhere near total eventual output, is producing more batteries than any other factory in the world, according to Elon Musk.
Battery production could become a major choke point for vehicle electrification as more automakers shift more of their model lineups to EVs and hybrids. More factories can definitely help, but supply of base materials could become an even bigger hindrance in the future.

25,California DMV changes rules to allow testing and use of fully autonomous vehicles,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/11/california-dmv-changes-rules-to-allow-testing-and-use-of-fully-autonomous-vehicles/,2017/10/11,"
The California Department of Motor Vehicles is changing its rules to allow companies to test autonomous vehicles without a driver behind the wheel — and to let the public use autonomous vehicles.
The DMV released a revised version of its regulations and has started a 15-day public comment period, ending October 25, 2017.
California law requires the DMV to work on regulations to cover testing and public use of autonomous vehicles, and the regulator said that this is the first step.
“We are excited to take the next step in furthering the development of this potentially life-saving technology in California,” the state’s Transportation Secretary, Brian Kelly, said in a statement.
California’s DMV took pains in its announcement to highlight that it wasn’t trying to overstep the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which has the final say on developing and enforcing compliance with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.
Rather, the California regulations, are going to require manufacturers to certify that they’ve met federal safety standards before their cars become (driverlessly) street legal.
And manufacturers still have to obey the state traffic laws written for California.
The revised regulations are the result of feedback from automakers, consumer advocates, local governments and insurance companies, the DMV said in a statement. It had previously released regulations on March 10, and this update incorporates the feedback from those various stakeholders into the current version of the rules.
Specific changes include, specifying local notifications on planned driverless testing, developing a template for how to report when a driver has disengaged autonomous modes, and identifying concerns that “would trigger an amended driverless testing or deployment applications to the DMV.”
California has had rules in place for driverless vehicles since 2014. As of now, 42 companies hold permits to test autonomous vehicles on California roads, the DMV said.
Written comments can be submitted to LADRegulations@dmv.ca.gov until October 25, 2017. Current regulations are availble on the California website under the “trending” section at the DMV homepage.
With the new revised regulations, California drives a bit farther down the road for autonomous vehicle testing, but it’s not alone. Singapore has already established zones for autonomous vehicle testing, and other nations are pushing to assume the pole position in the autonomous vehicle race.
Meanwhile, car companies are going to great lengths to see how well drivers can adjust to autonomous, driverless cars on the road. Witness Ford’s epic pranking of everyone by dressing up a driver as a car seat.

Want to drive a Porsche, without actually owning one? Porsche’s new Passport subscription program could be just what you’re looking for. The on-demand short-term rental program allows anyone in Atlanta to subscribe for $2,000 per month, which will provide access to eight models of Porsche including the 718 Boxster, Cayenne and Cayman S at launch.
Those who want a bit more can sign up for the Accelerate program, which is $3,000 per month, but which provides access to a total of 22 Porsche models and variants, including the 911 Carrera S, the Macan GTS and the Cayenne S E-Hybrid SUV.
The price of membership may seem steep, but it covers tax, registration, insurance, maintenance and even detailing fees, which can really add up when you’re talking about a Porsche. Also there’s a one-time $500 activation fee, as well as both a background and a credit check which is probably a fairly reasonable ask given the value of the vehicles you’ll be getting.
Atlantans who sign up can get their vehicles delivered on-demand to the location of their choosing in the metro Atlanta area starting this November, and then can exchange their cars for other models also using the Porsche Passport app. This Atlanta pilot, and its results, will determine whether Porsche continues to grow the program in the future.
Subscription-baesd car programs are increasingly an option automakers are looking to change up ownership and deal with the changing demands of customers. Cadillac debuted its own similar program early this year, and it’s likely going to be an option more car makers look at as consumers look around for alternatives to buying vehicles outright or traditional leasing models.

Velodyne, largely considered the current leader in LiDAR tech for autonomous vehicle development, announced today that it has increased its production capacity by more than 400 percent in order to meet growing global demand. This means it’s now actually offering immediate availability for its LiDAR sensors, for the first time in a long time, for clients in Europe, Asia Pacific and North America.
This new capacity has come from a boosted production rate at Velodyne’s gigantic 200,000 square foot Megafactory, and it has doubled its full-time employee count over the past six months as well to help spur production. Velodyne’s HDL-32/64 LiDARs, the classic ‘chicken bucket’ design you’ve likely seen on autonomous test vehicles in media photos or out in the real world, is the industry standard at the moment, with relatively few competitors even approaching the company in terms of production capability.
Velodyne has some emerging competitors, however, including startup Luminar, which emerged from stealth with a large workforce and production-ready design earlier this year. But it’s also working on new versions of its own LiDAR which will decrease cost and conspicuousness on a path toward production AVs.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang once told me that one of the things he was most excited about for the future of his company’s tech was bringing the Holodeck to life – and now, that’s exactly what Nvidia is doing with its new Holodeck photorealistic VR platform for designers and developers.
Nvidia Holodeck (yes, it’s actually called that) in an “intelligent virtual reality platform” created by the GPU maker that offers collaborative virtual environments with simulated real-world physics, highly detailed models built using photorealistic graphics at life-size scale. It’s not built to help Captain Picard live out film noir detective fantasies or swashbuckle the seas, however; Nvidia’s Holodeck is aimed at helping designers prototype, review and tweak designs to make it possible to bring products to market faster.
Holodeck is also AI-ready, meaning that you can train agents and deploy them in the virtual space to test your designs against anticipated real-world conditions, including virtual operators and incidental personnel and staff who might interact with any machinery or other objects being prototyped before they’re built.
Already, Nvidia has won praise from top architects, NASA engineers and cutting edge designers, based on their experience with pre-release testing. Now, it’s opening up to early access for a broader group, with the aim of refining it further.
Collaborative VR design tools are catching on in a big way among automakers, who are increasingly building out initial trials of virtual collaboration in service of vehicle design. There are plenty of other potential applications, too, and Nvidia could be poised to lead this shift given its experience on both the graphics side and in building AI that can enhance the simulated environments in use.

Nvidia revealed a new artificial intelligence computer based on its Drive PX platform designed specifically to bring Level 5 (completely self-driving) autonomous vehicles to market. The Drive PX Pegasus builds on its predecessor the Drive PX 2, offering over 10 times as many operations per second in terms of computing capability, and it’s already being used by over 25 companies to develop fully driverless taxi vehicles for eventual deployment.
The self-driving computer is built on Nvidia’s CUDA GPUs, and also increase the practicality of the computing hardware requirements for actually fielding self-driving cars on real roads. Nvidia points out that vehicles today using Nvidia tech to field on demand autonomous taxis include basically entire data centres in the trunk, and Drive PX Pegasus is designed to help put them on track to bring this down to something more manageable for actual production deployment.
Drive PX Pegasus packs in four AI processors, including two of Nvidia’s latest generation Xavier system-on-a-chip models with embedded Nvidia Volta GPUs, with two next-generation discrete GPUs designed specifically to hep accelerate deep learning and computer vision. The overall size of the system is roughly that of a license plate, Nvidia says, and it greatly reduces energy consumption and overall cost as well.
Pegasus is set to be available to Nvidia partners during the second half of 2018, while companies can get started now with Drive PX 2 if they want to chart a path to upgrade later on.

At Nvidia’s GTC Europe conference today, one of the company’s partners detailed plans to bring an autonomous delivery fleet to operating status starting in 2018. Deutsche Post DHL Group wants to put trucks on the road in partnership with auto supplier ZF by that time frame, using electric light transport vehicles equipped with ZF’s Nvidia-based ProAI self-driving system.
DPDHL will help make this happen staring now, by equipping its fleet of 3,400 electric delivery StreetScooter vehicles with ZF sensors, including video cameras, as well as LiDAR and radar. The data gathered by these vehicles will help inform ZF’s ProAI self-driving system, teaching the AI to be able to navigate itself along the delivery routes handled by DPDHL once its autonomous trucks are ready to come to market.
In addition to the Nvidia-powered ZF ProAI self-driving tech, which uses Nvidia’s Drive PX AI computers, DPDHL is also using Nvidia’s DGX-1 AI supercomputer in its data center to train the neural networks that will prove the basis for its future autonomous delivery fleet.
Nvidia and DPDHL unveiled the prototype electric light delivery vehicle at GTC Europe today, equipped with six cameras, plus two LiDAR sensors and a radar array.

31,"Waymo teams with MADD, the NSC and more on self-driving education",https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/09/waymo-teams-with-madd-the-nsc-and-more-on-self-driving-education/,2017/10/09,"
Waymo is working with a number of organizations on a new self-driving education campaign to help answer questions the public has about autonomous vehicles and technology. The program is designed to provide easily accessible info that offers answers to questions including “are self-driving cars safe?” and “how do they know what to do?” and it includes participation from Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the National Safety Council, the Foundation for Blind Children, the East Valley Partnership and the Foundation for Senior Living.
The new campaign, called “Let’s Talk Self Driving” will include both digital and outdoor advertising, with an initial focus on Arizona, where Waymo is currently testing its autonomous ride hailing service in a limited pilot. The plan is to eventually expand this into a national program, with exposure to Waymo’s self-driving tech for the general public a key aspiration for its expansion.
Waymo’s partners in this program might be the most indicative of how it hopes to drive acceptance of autonomous vehicles among members of the public who might be skeptical about sharing the roads with self-driving cars. MADD National President Colleen Sheehey-Church notes in a statement that self-driving could “completely eliminate drunk driving and other causes of traffic deaths,” while the NSC says that “automation holds incredible promise” but that “Americans will need to understand what self-driving vehicles can and can’t do.”
Both the Foundation for Blind Children and the Foundation for Senior Living focus on the message of how autonomous driving could increase independence and mobility for populations for which that’s currently a challenge, and the East Valley Partnership adds in support for the potential of autonomy to decrease congestion and unlock more productive time.
Waymo basically couldn’t have asked for better partners in this initiative, in terms of outlining the potential public benefit of rolling out autonomous vehicles nationwide. Public acceptance, which will have a tremendous effect on regulatory concerns, will be as important as technology in bringing self-driving vehicles to consumers, so this campaign is likely to be one of many attempts to move the needle on general awareness.

32,Cruise acquires Strobe to help dramatically reduce LiDAR costs,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/09/cruise-acquires-strobe-to-help-dramatically-reduce-lidar-costs/,2017/10/09,"
Cruise, the self-driving car startup GM acquired last year, has acquired a startup of its own – Strobe, a LiDAR sensor maker that reduces an entire LiDAR array down to just one chip, which Cruise says will be instrumental in helping it reduce the cost of LiDAR on a per vehicle basis by nearly 100 percent.
The cost issue is a big one: LiDAR remains one of the single most expensive component in the autonomous vehicle stack, and it’s a bottleneck not just in terms of cost, but also in terms of manufacturing complexity and performance and reliability over time across all types of weather, as Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt notes in a Medium post announcing the news.
Vogt says that decreasing costs for autonomous vehicles will be key in deploying them across a range of different areas, including in the suburbs and outside of major cities, where currently the economics would make it difficult to deploy something like an autonomous ride hailing service.
Strobe’s LiDAR component
Strobe’s technology offers accurate measurement of both distance and velocity, Vogt says, and combined with radar, can provide information vital to decision-making for self-driving cars. Strobe will bring their team and founders to Cruise, and Cruise will work with both its new engineers and with GM resources to develop LiDAR tech along with GM’s Hughes Research Labs skunkworks team.
Velodyne is currently the industry leader in terms of LiDAR employed in self-driving vehicle technology, but many are trying to improve the cost, form factor and reliability of LiDAR parts. Another startup, Luminar, recently revealed the scale of its own operation, and it’s also announced that it’s working with Toyota Research Institute along with other select partners to add its capabilities to autonomous test vehicles on the road.

33,Elon pushes back Tesla Semi unveiling to focus on Model 3 and Puerto Rico,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/06/elon-pushes-back-tesla-semi-unveiling-to-focus-on-model-3-and-puerto-rico/,2017/10/06,"
Back at the beginning of September, Elon Musk tweeted that the company would unveil its long rumored all-electric semi truck on October 26th. He noted that it was “tentatively” scheduled, leaving the door open for a date change if need be. Turns out that was a good call.
In a tweet this afternoon, Elon says the Semi unveil date is now set for November 16th — a shift of about three weeks.
The reasoning for the rescheduling? Musk mentions two things they’re focusing on right now instead: Model 3 bottlenecks and Puerto Rico battery production.


Tesla Semi unveil now Nov 16. Diverting resources to fix Model 3 bottlenecks & increase battery production for Puerto Rico & other affected areas.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 6, 2017



Yesterday morning Musk offered Tesla’s assistance in rebuilding Puerto Rico’s electric system after the devastation of Hurricane Maria left just 10 percent of the island with power; by the afternoon, the governor of Puerto Rico was tweeting back to say he wanted to talk about it.
As for the Model 3 bottlenecks mentioned: Tesla aimed to ship around 1,500 Model 3s in the third quarter of 2017, but disclosed on Monday that they’d ended up shipping around 260. While the company pinned the shortfall on production bottlenecks, they noted that they already “understand” the underlying issues and are “confident of addressing the manufacturing bottleneck issues in the near-term” — so, presumably, tackling those issues will be a key part of these next few weeks.

34,Udacity spin-out Voyage is testing self-driving cars in retirement communities,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/04/udacity-spin-out-voyage-is-testing-self-driving-cars-in-retirement-communities/,2017/10/04,"
Voyage, the self-driving technology company that spun out of Udacity earlier this year when some executives and students decided to commercialize their work, has been testing its autonomous vehicles in a retirement community in San Jose, and is looking to expand its trial.
The testing at Villages Golf and Country Club in California has involved using a modified Ford Fusion equipped with self-driving software and additional sensors, including LiDAR and radar, in a community which has about 4,000 residents. The roads, which are controlled in terms of allowed traffic, offer a good starting point for autonomous testing, according to a new report from The New York Times, because they cut down on the number of variables that have to be taken into account.
So far, Voyage has been testing on 15 miles of road that are shared with pedestrians, pets, other cars and even golf carts — but all with a max speed limit of 25 miles per hour. And though the roads are used like public ones, they’re private, which gives Voyage leeway in terms of how much information about its testing it has to disclose to public entities and regulators.
Voyage also thinks retirement communities are a good target audience in terms of AV use: seniors who no longer drive themselves stand to benefit a lot from being able to regain independence through the use of self-driving ride-hailing services and on-demand transportation.
The NYT reports that Voyage had to jump through a few hoops to make the test work — including paying double for insurance and agreeing to hand over anonymized data to its insurer, and providing an equity stake in the company to the Villages itself. But it sounds like a logical test starting point, and also a way to approach the problem differently from some of Voyage’s larger competitors.

35,Dyson seeks to beat rivals on range with its electric car,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/04/dyson-seeks-to-beat-rivals-on-range-with-its-electric-car/,2017/10/04,"
Dyson is building an electric car, the company revealed last week, and now we know a bit more about their specific plan to bring one to market. Dyson won’t look to partner, and will instead build the vehicle hardware from the ground up itself, according to a new Wired interview with Dyson CEO Max Conze. By relying on its own battery and motor tech, Dyson hopes to be able to beat the range of existing electric vehicles by between 50 and 100 percent, Conze says.
That would indeed be a differentiating point for Dyson with its offering, and probably the best chance it has at delivering a product that can woo consumers away from electric offerings from traditional carmakers and the likes of Tesla. And Dyson says it wants to “do its own thing,” and use in-house engineering “that can do the car end-to-end and also […] own the manufacturing.”
Dyson isn’t planning on building its own self-driving software, however, and predicts it’ll be able to buy autonomous systems “off the shelf” from suppliers once the time comes for that technology to be properly integrated into a shipping vehicle.
Going it alone seems like a big challenge for a newcomer to the auto industry like Dyson – but Conze tells Wired it’s actually going to be an advantage in many ways, because they don’t have to build upon what came before. A clean slate means they can focus their efforts on something brand new, and a vehicle platform tailored totally to their electric goal.
Dyson also added that it’s not planning on investing significantly in charging infrastructure because it hopes to improve range to the point where needing to charge frequently isn’t an issue. Critics have expressed skepticism about the vacuum maker’s ability to pull this off, and seeming nonchalance about key factors like infrastructure seem to back up those doubts, but Dyson does have deep expertise with maximizing electric motor efficiency – and a history of demonstrating focus when it comes to innovating product categories that others have overlooked.

36,Judge delays Waymo/Uber trial until December 4th,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/03/judge-delays-waymouber-trial-until-december-4th/,2017/10/03,"
This morning, Judge William Alsup ruled that the Waymo v. Uber trial would be delayed until December 4th. The trial had initially been expected to start with jury selection next Tuesday on October 10th. Ultimately this gives Waymo additional time to review new documents associated with the Stroz report in advance of the start of the trial.
Waymo has been pushing for the delay to account for the mountain of materials in need of review surrounding Stroz’s due diligence report. The report, which was published online last night, was commissioned to explore potential IP concerns around Uber’s acquisition of Otto.
During arguments today, Waymo’s legal team noted that the volume of documents related to the report is “shocking.” These are documents that Waymo is just getting its hands on and has not fully evaluated in advance of the start of the trial. Part of the team’s irritation is that it has allegedly asked for these documents to be sent over multiple times with no headway made.
Uber on the other hand has been cautious about letting pre-trial discovery drag on. Its legal team says that the majority of the documents Waymo wants to dig through have been secured in a storage facility since 2010. They assert that Waymo has already spent 4,450 hours reviewing materials and that the company is unlikely to find additional evidence in the old collection of documents.
Meanwhile Judge Alsup remains frustrated with both sides for presenting in “half truths.” Alsup said that despite the quality of the lawyers he has had to evaluate everything said. He spent significant time today evaluating the validity of statements made by both sides.
“I believe that Waymo has exaggerated the need for continuance and it’s not nearly as dire as what has been represented to me,” Judge Alsup asserted.
Despite his annoyance, he still decided to grant a continuance — a delay in the start of the trial. Jury selection will now occur on Nov 29th. The trial will run from December 4th until December 20th.
The delay did come with terms however. Judge Alsup’s new schedule is non negotiable and prevents new discovery absent stipulation or a overriding decision from Magistrate Judge Corley.
Over the coming weeks, Waymo will be looking to tie one of its trade secrets to Uber’s work. Waymo will be allowed to bring a motion to amend its list of nine trade secrets, alleged to have been stolen by Uber, up until October 23rd.
That list of nine trade secrets is said to be cemented barring an extreme discovery. If a major discovery is made and the list is allowed to be amended, Uber would be granted additional discovery.
Uber sent the following comment following the decision.

“The Court has made clear that Waymo’s case is not what they hoped, and that more time will not change the hard fact that their trade secrets never came to Uber. We’re ready to go to trial now, and will be ready after this very brief continuance.”

37,GM’s Cruise explains why self-driving tests in dense cities gives it an edge,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/03/gms-cruise-explains-why-self-driving-tests-in-dense-cities-gives-it-an-edge/,2017/10/03,"
GM is sharing more info about its testing process for autonomous cars through Cruise, the startup it acquired last year. For the first time, Cruise has shared some numbers related to the advantages it says its program has by placing emphasis on city testing, vs. testing only in less densely occupied areas.
“Cruise does the majority of its testing, or at least a significant portion of it, in San Francisco, and in particular the most dense part of San Francisco,” explained Cruise CEO and founder Kyle Vogt on a call related to the news.
“The big thing that we want to point out today, is that driving in San Francisco is almost nothing like driving in the suburbs or other places where self-driving cars are tested,” Vogt explained. “There’s a lot of talk about miles, but really miles are not created equally.”
Vogt’s reference to talk of “miles” is almost certainly an indirect jibe at Alphabet’s Waymo, which frequently reminds the public that it has the most miles of autonomous vehicle testing to its credit among companies working on the problem. Also, Vogt followed up quickly with another veiled reference to Waymo’s testing program, which is running a trial ride hailing service in Arizona.
“In more suburban areas like Scottsdale, which is a suburb of Phoenix, we actually have data so we can compare the two,” Vogt said. Hey added that in the city (of SF specifically), tricky maneuvers like passing vehicles by crossing over into opposing lane of traffic actually happen quite frequently, as opposed to in suburbs.

In fact, this kind of thing happens 23.5 times as often in dense urban environments vs. sparsely populated suburbs. And it’s the same when it comes to interacting with emergency vehicles, Vogt said, noting that Cruise’s vehicles encounter and have to interact with emergency vehicles almost 47 times as often in San Francisco vs. in a test environment like Scottsdale.
“As human drivers, we don’t draw too much of a distinction between driving in a suburb and driving in a city,” Vogt said, noting that actually they’re very, very different. He added that the reason Cruise has this focus isn’t arbitrary, but because it wants to test in the most challenging conditions in order to accelerate the deployment of actual AVs on roads.
Vogt says the complexity of running autonomous vehicles on roads is actually exponentially harder in urban cases, because the more objects you see, the more complex interaction between those objects have to be considered. In a simple environment, he noted, generally a vehicle is only doing one thing at a time. In dense conditions like San Francisco, all of these are stacked up on top of each other – like making a lane change while in presence of an emergency vehicle.
In response to a question about whether this announcement was a direct shot at Waymo, which has deployed a test pilot as mentioned above in a suburban area in Phoenix, Vogt said that “I’m saying there’s almost no comparison between driving in a suburban environment and in an urban one.”
Cruise’s testing is broadly split about equally in terms of the divide between suburban and city environments, per Vogt. He also provided a brief update on the progress of the company’s San Francisco based ride-hailing service pilot for employees.
“It’s given us some valuable feedback on what’s important from the customer standpoint,” he said. “We’ve been able to make some tweaks to our software to improve the experience.”

38,Tesla electric semi truck possibly spied in new photo,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/03/tesla-electric-semi-truck-possibly-spied-in-new-photo/,2017/10/03,"
Is this the new semi truck Tesla is set to unveil at the end of this month? The truck, posted to Reddit (then deleted, then re-posted) bears more than a passing resemblance to the image shared in a teaser released by the automaker itself (via The Verge). The sleek angled front also looks like something you’d expect to be electrically powered, if that makes any sense.
You can compare it yourself to the mostly shadowy teaser image shared by Tesla itself, but the main unifying factor here might be those flared fenders and angled headlights, which you can pretty clearly make out in the Reddit spy shot, too. The photo above was taken “somewhere in California,” where apparently Tesla has been known to test vehicles in the past.
Tesla’s officially revealing its semi truck on October 26, at an event teased by Elon Musk himself. The truck is rumored to have a range of between 200 and 300 miles on a single charge, which would be very impressive for an all-electric heavy-duty transport vehicle, though not something that’s suitable for long-haul trips. The big question will be how it charges – and how fast.

39,The due diligence report commissioned by Uber before acquiring Otto is now public,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/02/the-due-diligence-report-commissioned-by-uber-before-acquiring-otto-is-now-public/,2017/10/02,"
A potentially pivotal document in the legal fight between Uber and Waymo, the self-driving car company that was originally part of Google, has been released. It is a report (embedded at the bottom of this post) commissioned by Uber from cybersecurity firm Stroz Friedberg last year as part of its due diligence before acquiring Otto, a self-driving truck startup founded by former Google employees. Stroz was asked to investigate whether or not Otto co-founder Anthony Levandowski, a former Google engineer who worked on Waymo, and other Otto employees took confidential information from Google or breached their non-compete clauses.
Waymo, which filed a lawsuit against Uber in February, has fought for the document’s release, arguing that it likely contains information relevant to its allegations that Levandowski stole thousands of files from Google and brought them to Uber. It also said it may answer some of the questions Levandowski has refused to answer by exercising his Fifth Amendment rights. Uber, which fired Levandowski in May, declined to provide it, claiming that the document contains confidential information between attorneys and clients.
After a federal circuit judge ruled last month that Uber must hand over the report, Waymo said it needs more time to review it and asked for the trial, which is scheduled to start in a week, to be postponed. A hearing will take place tomorrow on whether or not to grant Waymo’s request.
Stroz investigators reviewed over 100,000 documents, 74,000 pictures and 176,000 source code files for the report. It shows that Levandowski accessed Google files, including ones related to the design of driverless cars, even after he left the company, but it doesn’t conclude what he did with them.
Among other revelations, Levandowski told Stroz that he found five discs containing Google information in a closet while searching his house for devices to give the investigators, but had them destroyed at a commercial shredding factory called Shred Works in Oakland. Levandowski told Stroz that they contained proprietary information, including source code and design files related to Google self-driving cars.
Levandowski also said that he informed Uber employees, including chief executive officer Travis Kalanick, about the existence of the discs in March 2016. He says Kalanick said he wanted nothing to do with the discs and told Levandowski to “do what he needed to do.” After that, Levandowski says he took them to Shred Works and watched as they were destroyed.
Stroz followed up during its investigation by visiting Shred Works, but couldn’t confirm if the documents were indeed ordered destroyed by Levandowski. While a Shred Works facility manager found a receipt that indicated it had received cash to destroy five discs around the time Levandowski told Uber about them, the signature on the receipt was illegible and no one at the faciility recognized Levandowski from a photo Stroz showed them.
Stroz also said it found 50,000 work emails from Levandowski’s time at Google on his personal computer. Levandowski claimed that he did not remember when he last looked at the emails and “seemed surprised” at how many of them were on his laptop. But because ten of those emails were accessed between September 2015 and January 2016, when Levandowski left Google, Stroz investigators wrote that it was “difficult to believe that Levandowski was not, prior to his interview, fully aware of the extent of the data that he had retained.”
Stroz found that Levandowski had accessed Google files even after he left the company and then deleted them, including source code and electronic design files related to driverless cars. He also asked an unknown recipient to delete iMessages from him during the investigation and even attempted to empty the trash on his Macbook Pro while he was at Stroz’s office, but investigators found no files contained in his trash at the time he tried to empty it.
Investigators wrote that even though Levandowski may have deleted those files in “good faith” to comply with Google’s requirements, he shouldn’t have after he knew the investigation was going to take place:
“Many of these deletions may have been good faith attempts by Levandowski to purge retained Google material from his devices in accordance with his obligation not to retain confidential Google data. However, by March 2016, Levandowski was aware that Stroz Friedberg was going to implement a process to preserve, identify and potentially remediate retained Google material from his devices. At that point, the better course would have been to let that process control. In addition, there was an effort by Levandowski and his Ottomotto colleagues to delete texts in real time.”
In a press statement, an Uber spokesperson said:
“Before Uber acquired Otto, we hired an independent forensics firm to conduct due diligence because we wanted to prevent any Google IP from coming to Uber. Their report, which we are pleased is finally public, helps explain why—even after 60 hours of inspection of our facilities, source code, documents and computers—no Google material has been found at Uber. Waymo is now attempting to distract from that hard fact, even attempting to hide its core trade secrets case from the public and the press by closing the courtroom. In the end, the jury will see that Google’s trade secrets are not and never were at Uber.”
As expected, Waymo has a different take. Here is its statement about the release of the report:
“The Stroz Report unequivocally shows that, before it acquired his company, Uber knew Anthony Levandowski had a massive trove of confidential Waymo source code, design files, technical plans and other materials after leaving Google; that he stole information deliberately, and repeatedly accessed it after leaving Waymo; and that he tried to destroy the evidence of what he had done. In addition, Mr. Levandowski used his smartphone to take thousands of covert photographs of computer screens displaying Google confidential files. Knowing all of this, Uber paid $680 million for Mr. Levandowski’s company, protected him from legal action, and installed him as the head of their self-driving vehicle program. This report raises significant questions and justifies careful review.”

40,"Tesla made only 260 Model 3 cars in Q3, but is ‘confident’ it can fix bottleneck",https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/02/tesla-made-only-260-model-3-cars-in-q3-but-is-confident-it-can-fix-bottleneck/,2017/10/02,"
Tesla has released its quarterly vehicle production numbers for the third quarter of 2017, which it says was its “all-time best quarter for Model S and Model X deliveries” — but it was not a great quarter for production of the Model 3, of which only 260 were made. This was far under predicted totals, which Tesla ascribes to “production bottlenecks,” though it also says that it “understands” the issues and that there are “no fundamental issues with the Model 3 Production or supply chain.”
Tesla had said in August that it should be able to achieve production of around 1,500 cars during the quarter, so it clearly undershot its earlier target. This explains why, at the Model 3 initial employee launch event in July, Elon Musk stressed that Model 3 would face “production hell,” which would proceed only at the pace of its slowest component production rate.
Tesla says that it is “confident of addressing the manufacturing bottleneck issues in the near-term,” but didn’t provide an updated prediction for its future production capacity. Musk said in July that it knows that its production rate for the 3 will look like an S-curve, but it’s not yet sure the scale and shape of that S-curve, as the component supply chain for the vehicle includes 30 percent of parts sourced from outside North America, and is subject to significant “force majeure risk.”
Including the Model 3, Tesla produced 25,336 vehicles, the vast majority of which were Model S and X vehicles. Of the 260 Model 3s it made during the quarter, 220 were delivered to customers, those being presumably mostly staff and investors.

41,GM to introduce two new all-electric cars by 2019 in path to zero emissions,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/02/gm-to-introduce-two-new-all-electric-cars-by-2019-in-path-to-zero-emissions/,2017/10/02,"
GM today announced a strategy to eventually deliver a zero emission product line across all its segments, though it didn’t put a specific timeline on when it would achieve that goal. The process is complex, said Mark Reuss, EVP Global Product Development, and GM doesn’t see there being “one year where we flip a switch and it’s all electric.”
Still, GM is committing to rolling out two new all-electric vehicles within the next 18 months, and to having at least 20 new all-electric vehicles in the market by 2023. GM also debuted its new SURUS fuel-cell concept platform today, which is a four-wheel steering concept truck-based vehicle with two electric motors and a flexible design which could work with a range of different vehicles in commercial capacities, including delivery vehicles, trucks or ambulances.
This build on previous declarations made by GM CEO Mary Barra, who announced that the company is ultimately committed to world with zero emissions, and zero crashed. The Chevrolet Bolt has helped immensely with progress towards the zero emissions part, Reuss said.
He noted that GM has sold “thousands” of the Bolt in its first year, and that Chevrolet customers “love them.” Reuss also added that the Bolt is a “window into how GM will move humanity forward in the future, with all-electric propulsion.”
Reuss added that “GM believes the future is all-electric,” and that “these aren’t just words in a war of press releases,” referring to the spate of recent announcements by automakers committing to offering either hybrid or electric versions of their entire lineup by some future date. GM cautioned that its approach will be more methodical, however, and based on user feedback.
“An electric solution cannot be one size fits all,” Reuss said. “We believe you need both battery electric and fuel cell electric… how we apply each of these technologies will depend on what we hear from customers about their needs.”
Meanwhile, GM said it will continue to increase efficiency of fuel injection vehicles to facilitate the transition. Reuss noted that GM has advantages in this race because
“light weighting of vehicles has been a priority over many years,” even with its fuel cars, and you then combine that with the agility of the battery pack, and GM’s strategy of reducing the coast of battery packs in use by reducing the size of the battery pack itself to find its competitive advantage.
Reuss repeatedly emphasized the importance of fuel cell electric in GM’s zero emission strategy, since it’ll become part of both consumer retail and military, commercial, utility segments for the automaker. He said that they’ll start with commercial infrastructure to support such a rollout, and then have that transition to informing the retail segment infrastructure rollout as well.

Aeronautics industry giant Airbus is teaming up with hardware early-stage investment firm HAX to create a four-month accelerator program based in Shenzhen focused on a high-flying goal – “urban air mobility.” The program will seek to guide startups working on various aspects of flying cars and aerial city transportation, including air traffic management, perception systems, autonomous flight and collisions avoidance.
The program will offer participants a minimum $100,000 as an upfront investment, as well as advice and guidance from experts on both the HAX and Airbus teams, across the four-month long program.
This is the latest in a string of interesting developments around short-haul urban air transportation tech, which includes a number of startups with strong backing, like Sebastian Thrun’s Kitty Hawk. Airbus has also been developing its own vertical take-off and landing craft (VTOL) strategy through its Vahanna project, and it’s become an area of focus for investors and engineering training in the world of Silicon Valley.
The new program likely won’t be the last of its kind, but it will be interesting to see what kinds of startups form around this opportunity given that the timeline for putting autonomous aircraft to work in a commercial capacity at scale, profitably, seems quite a long ways out.

43,Self-driving startup Drive.ai to open Singapore office with new Grab funding,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/28/self-griving-startup-drive-ai-to-open-singapore-office-with-new-grab-funding/,2017/09/28,"
Autonomous vehicle technology startup Drive.ai has raised $15 million in a new round from Grab and others, Southeast Asia’s largest Uber rival. The added funding will help Drive.ai expand internationally, and it plans to open a Singapore office in the coming months in order to provide a base of operations for considering a deployment of its self-driving cars in the country.
This isn’t yet a formal partnership between Grab and Drive.ai, though Grab has previously partnered with Boston’s NuTonomy to put self-driving vehicles on the road in Singapore. Instead, it’s an investment that will also involve Grab assisting Drive.ai with its evaluation of the local market for deployment of its tech, including facilitating partnerships between government and other local businesses.
In an interview, Drive.ai CEO Sameep Tandon called the effort to develop usable self-driving tech “a global space race,” and said that international expansion is important to the company as a result. The Singapore opportunity also came about thanks a lucky combination of factors, including meeting with the Grab team at home in California, and also a visit to Singapore by Drive.ai co-founder and president Carol Reiley.
“[Carol] visited Singapore last year around Christmas time, and met with Grab’s AV team around then,” Tandon explained. “Coincidentally we had several of Grab’s folks come out here, they were in the area so we gave them an AV ride. They became really excited about the long-term possibilities with us as well as how deep learning could make the self-driving car brain better. Once Anthony [Tan], Grab’s CEO came over it was pretty much a done deal at that point.”
As to why Singapore proved the right opportunity for Drive.ai’s first international office and expansion target, Tandon explained that a combination of factors make it a spot that’s ideal for their own goals and development plans.
“We look at Singapore as a country, it’s been a technological juggernaut,” Tandon said. “When innovations happen in the region, basically they start in Singapore and then move out to other places within the region, whether it’s Indonesia, Vietnam or China. What’s also really interesting to us about Singapore is they have this sort of existential problem here – for them autonomous driving is not a matter of ‘if,’ it’s a matter of ‘when.’ They have this high population density in a very small physical area, and the extra challenges that go along with that.”
This has resulted in a government and transportation agencies that are very supportive of self-driving technology companies, and trying to find innovative solutions to these problems. They’re already working with a number of these agencies to flesh out what their presence in the country will look like.
Drive.ai is fresh off a partnership with Lyft and a $50 million funding round, and earlier this year it revealed more about how its approach is different from others working on self-driving – thanks to a specific focus on creating a retrofit kit that can be installed in existing fleets to give them autonomous capabilities. This should help it achieve more of a global presence, and Tandon says they’ll continue to keep an eye on worldwide hot spots when it comes to autonomous technology opportunities.

The project is codenamed “Neptune,” and the concept designs envision a sleek underwater craft with aggressive pointy-ended pontoons and a central passenger bubble cockpit with an unobstructed, all-around view.
The Neptune submersible combines Aston Martin’s design skills with Triton’s ability to produce functional submersibles for researchers, explores and the super-rich. Triton’s expertise lies in making sure that submarines can actually submerge safely, which is what gives me hope that this concept will indeed proceed to the limited edition production phase, as Aston Martin says it will.

Project Neptune is based on an existing three-person submarine platform from Triton’s lineup, so that’s another win in terms of production viability. And even when it does get made, it’s going to be an “exclusive, strictly limited edition vehicle” so you probably won’t see these dotting the local harbor regardless.
Still, I would like one, and I’ll move to an ocean-bound city to make it happen.

45,Daimler acquires German P2P carpooling startup Flinc,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/28/daimler-acquires-german-p2p-carpooling-startup-flinc/,2017/09/28,"
Daimler — the German car giant that owns Mercedes-Benz among other brands — has made one more acquisition to further its reach in ridesharing and what it sees as the next generation of how cars are owned and used. It has acquired Flinc, a startup also out of Germany that has built a platform and app for peer-to-peer-style carpooling.
People who are driving in one direction find people who are looking to go in the same direction and offer them rides, with the subsequent deal either negotiated in cash or simple done for free.
I’m not sure that Daimler’s deal for Flinc was done for free, but the financial terms are not being disclosed.
Flinc — which exists as a standalone app and is also integrated into other services, such as larger enterprise’s company apps for work colleagues to carpool together — will continue to operate independently, Daimler said, led by the startup’s founders, Dr. Klaus Dibbern, Michael Hübl and Benjamin Kirschner.
Founded in 2010, flinc had raised an undisclosed amount of money from a group of investors that include Deutsche Bahn (the German train and transport company); General Motors Ventures and Ecomobility Ventures. GM’s investment was partly strategic: European subsidiary Opel integrated Flinc into its own employee backend to enable ridesharing amongst its own employees.
Indeed, I wonder if the fact that Flinc doesn’t seem to have made profit the primary idea behind the rides that it enables (its URL is even “flinc.org”) is one of the reasons why it has happily existed while fire and brimstone has rained down upon Uber for allegedly flouting commercial driving regulations in multiple markets.
A large part of Flinc’s technology appears to involve smart navigation: it works out your route from A to B, and then the route for individuals looking for rides, and then it matches them up, serving options between potential pairs only one at a time to avoid double-booking and confusion. Some 500,000 people have used the service to date.
Daimler Mobility Services, the division that has made the acquisition, says that the deal is part of Daimler’s strategy to “transition from being an automobile manufacturer to a mobility services provider.”
It’s one more sign of how automakers are preparing for a potential future where cars are more expensive (because they carry more tech in them, such as self-driving capabilities), and are therefore purchased less often, leading automotive manufacturers to search for other kinds of business models around their vehicles.
“Transport options are just as varied as the mobility demands of our customers. Whether flexible carsharing, ride-hailing or door-to-door ridesharing, with our mobility services, we are able to provide the ideal solution,” said Jörg Lamparter, head of Mobility Services at Daimler, in a statement. “With Flinc, we are taking on an extremely well-coordinated team that brings valuable experience in the field of short-distance ridesharing.”
Daimler has not been a stranger to the bigger changes we are seeing in the transportation industry. Recent investments from the company have included putting $60 million into quick-charging battery startup Storedot, $250 million into Via, a shuttle-based ridesharing company, and investments into Careem, Blacklane, FlixBus and Turo. Other acquisitions include car2go and mytaxi (which includes its acquisition also of Uber competitor Hailo).
Daimler is not alone in the race for more technology and startups that are building it. General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen and Volvo have all also bet big on autonomous cars and transportation startups that are helping consumers live without owning their own vehicles.

The connected car and another fragmented market




Tesla talks a lot about safety, and rightfully so. They have beaten even the safest cars at their own game and thus have created a family brand in the process. In the spirit of safety and family, one of the major success stories that Tesla hasn’t brought to the forefront is that it could very well be the greatest family car since the modern-day station wagon — but for less obvious reasons.
The “easy” stuff. The model S and X hold an incredible amount of cargo and people and get you to your destination in a quiet, supremely comfortable and almost effortless manner. Yes, the power comes on like a knife through warm butter, in such a linear fashion that even the great combustion engines are quivering in their cylinders. With all its engineering prowess, however, the supercharging is where the true family friendliness starts to shine.
Consider for a moment the last time you took a road trip with your kid(s), something over 200 miles. Did you stop? If so, how many times? Did you take time out of the drive to get out and stretch and walk? What type of food did you eat along the trip? How did you and your family feel when you arrived at your destination? If you answered “no” to the above and prefer snacks, junk food and cranky, hangry co-pilots, then you probably aim to travel with lowest time duration in mind. This is generally the worst for your children, not to mention your health and state of mind… and this is where charging comes in.
With all its engineering prowess, however, the supercharging is where the true family friendliness starts to shine.
 
It’s undeniable that each time you use your Tesla for a road trip, you’re going to likely add between 20-40 minutes to your trip, per charge. Conversely, for a similar distance in a traditional gasoline-powered car, you may only need to stop for 5-10 minutes to fill up, saving you a net gain of about 20 minutes. Here lies the secret of Tesla. The extra time required to charge creates a shift in mindset, and the dreaded kicking and screaming from the back seat turns into an opportunity to get out, eat a normal and healthier meal and play.
Superchargers are usually sponsored by a restaurant, shopping center or grocery store so you and the kids can find something for everyone. Instead of eating snacky gas station food in the car, you are set up to sit down and eat a real and healthier meal at a picnic table or in a family restaurant. It has proven to be a smart model for Tesla to partner with local commerce in building their network. Many of the superchargers are situated next to parks, and almost always have space to walk around, kick a ball, have a picnic and thus provide a certain quietness not found when paying at the pump.
For the Tesla families, there’s great software showing you restaurants with clean bathrooms, grocery stores and charging availability for you as a driver to choose from. If your kids prefer Panera Bread over a grocery store, no problem, there’s an app for that; try Teslarati or EVTripping.
If you’re like most Tesla drivers, you’re looking to balance the amount of time needed to charge with the overall trip. With a recent update that Tesla pushed to the driver’s dash, you can now see supercharger availability, which is a good starting point. If you want to get a bit more detail, you can use a product called TezLab (full disclosure, my company built TezLab) that will show you your charging rate and estimated wait times, among other features, enabling you to maximize family time while you charge.
As the summer winds down and I reflect on the almost 7,000 miles of driving that’s been done, I now look forward to the times when I can charge. The experience of getting out of the car, plugging in the charger, grabbing the kids and walking away to reset is a shift, but a rewarding one. You’ll likely feel more refreshed, even with a slightly longer duration, and have a happier family if you decide to make the move to electric for your next family car.

47,Uber is shutting down its Xchange vehicle leasing business,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/27/uber-is-shutting-down-its-xchange-vehicle-leasing-business/,2017/09/27,"
Uber has confirmed to TechCrunch that it will shut down its Xchange Leasing subsidiary, which provided vehicle leases to drivers on the service that couldn’t otherwise procure vehicles through traditional financing options.
The shutdown wasn’t unexpected – Uber said in August that it was working on what to do with the business, after reports emerged that it was considering a shutdown. Uber at the time decided together with its board that it was resulting in “sustainably high losses,” per a Wall Street Journal report.
Today’s shutdown was reported first by the Wall Street Journal, and confirmed to TechCrunch via a spokesperson, who provided the following statement from the company:
“We have decided to stop operating Xchange Leasing and move towards a less capital-intensive approach.”
The Xchange Leasing shutdown will affect around 500 jobs, per the Journal, and indicates that the company ultimately wasn’t able to find a better solution regarding what it should do with its leasing business.
Uber has also partnered with other companies on making cars available to drivers on shorter term, no commitment bases, including providers like GM’s Maven, so that could be something it focuses more on in future to make vehicles available to drivers without their own cars.

Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant will be your cockpit companion in future BMWs: The automaker will offer Alexa in select cars starting in 2018, Amazon announced today at a special event revealing a host of product news at its Seattle HQ.
The vehicle integration will begin in the middle of next year, the companies revealed, and will provide access to Alexa skills and voice-based capabilities right from the infotainment system. This isn’t the first time Alexa has shown up in vehicles, as Ford demonstrated a test version of its Sync platform with Alexa functionality baked in at CES last January.
BMW also previously teamed up with Amazon to release Alexa skills for the BMW Connected app, that let vehicle owners do things like check how much fuel there is in their cars from their Echo devices at home.
The new partnership with BMW means that its vehicles will also include far-field microphones throughout the vehicle, which will make voice interaction easy, and it’ll display visual output using the car’s in-vehicle display information and navigation display.

Delphi is renaming the part of its business that’s focused on automated driving and electrification, calling the new entity Aptiv starting from March, when it will formalize the separation of that aspect of its company from the portion focused on more traditional powertrain.
Once the spin-off is finished, Delphi’s current CEO Kevin Clark will become CEO of Aptiv, and Delphi’s current CTO Glen De Vos will also make the transition over to the same role at Aptiv, which probably gives you a good sense of where the company’s priorities lie in terms of future focus.
Aptiv was chosen for the name because of how it reflects “adaptiveness,” according to the company, and the overall focus will be on the so-called “brain” elements of the vehicle, as well as its sensing capabilities, ADAS and connected services.
As for the rest of Delphi, current Powertrain business president Liam Butterworth will take over as CEO.
Delphi has made a number of moves in autonomous driving, including partnering with Intel and operating some test vehicles developed in partnership with the chipmaker and its own recent acquisition Mobileye. It’s likely its partnerships will all continue under the new Aptiv entity and name.

50,Toyota Research Institute debuts its next-generation automated driving platform,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/27/toyota-research-institute-self-driving-2-1/,2017/09/27,"
Toyota Research Institute (TRI) isn’t letting the grass grow long on its autonomous vehicle research platform: The research wing of carmaker Toyota is updating its self-driving test car to version 2.1, and it’s demonstrating the new architecture on a closed course for the first time ever. The new self-driving research vehicle incorporates new perception models, enabled in part by new hardware and component suppliers including LiDAR provider Luminar, which emerged from stealth earlier this year.
The other additions to this platform include a new full cockpit in the front passenger seat for drive-by-wire control with steering wheels and pedals. TRI says that this is useful for the research team in terms of giving them ways to study transferring control back and forth between driver and automated system.

Toyota researchers also created a new UI system that unifies visual elements and graphic language across both its Guardian and Chauffeur system, to help combine the different levels of autonomy the system can provide into one more familiar interface. Guardian and Chauffeur represent the two different ways Toyota is looking to deploy autonomy: Guardian operates in tandem with a human driver in full control, and acting only to avoid crashes and mitigate accidents, while Chauffeur intends to offer full SAE Level 4 and 5 self-driving – meaning anyone on board is strictly a passenger, and bears no responsibility to take over control.
Both of these projects use the same tech stack including sensors and camera hardware, and this new version of the platform is the first version of its test vehicle that incorporates both Guardian and Chauffeur in one. It’s an interesting advance in terms of research because it could eventually mean that deployed vehicles with autonomous tech from Toyota could incorporate Guardian to begin with, and graduate to Chauffeur later on as the tech advances and becomes available.

51,Luminar’s game-changing LiDAR makes its way to TRI’s self-driving car,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/27/luminar-lidar-toyota-research-institute/,2017/09/27,"
When I ask around about who has the most potential to make big waves in the LiDAR industry, one name tops the list: Luminar, the startup that emerged from stealth earlier this year after five years developing its unique LiDAR architecture from the ground up. Now, Luminar is revealing the first of its four current major partners: Toyota Research Institute (TRI), the research and development organization created by the global automaker to focus on robotics, autonomous vehicles and AI breakthroughs.
TRI is using Luminar’s LiDAR in its new Platform 2.1 autonomous test vehicle, having selected the solution because of its unmatched capabilities in terms of being able to see at a distance, and to also perceive objects that traditionally have very low reflectivity for laser light, which makes them a lot harder to pick up via LiDAR. These include common objects on the road including tires, and anything else with a dark, matte surface.
“When developing this product, we remained in stealth for five years, ensuring that by the time we came out we were already working with some of the best programs out there,” explained Luminar CEO Austin Russell in an interview. “We now have a product that we had the utmost confidence in – something that isn’t just an idea on a post-it note with some questionable physics, but actually a real-world system that we believe can truly enable these autonomous vehicle systems to finally have that better-than-human level perception.”
Luminar had to got back to basics to develop a LiDAR that fit this description, and owns much of its stack, rather than sourcing anything from off-the-shelf suppliers. It has a facility in Orlando, Florida where it has managed to recruit some of the world’s leading optical engineering talent (Orlando has a lot of that talent thanks to the aerospace industry presence there, Russell told me) and it has even acquired some of its suppliers along the way to vertically integrate all the pieces that come together to help create its LiDAR.
“[Luminar] gives a company such as Toyota or TRI such a huge head start and advantage with this problem, because of the opportunity to leave everybody in the dust with this fundamentally new level and quality of data to be able to work off of,” Russell said. “The way the that the software is architected and the autonomous vehicle is built out really changes when you have this new level and quality of data. Ultimately, everyone’s going to have to adopt this type of platform if you want to be able to succeed in the long run.”

Russell says that there’s opportunity for TRI and Toyota to “leapfrog the rest of the industry” when it comes to the pace of its autonomous vehicle technology because of the sensing advantages that its product provides vs. other industry leading alternatives, including stalwarts like Velodyne, whose large multi-laser arrays adorn most current-generation test cars you’ll see on roads.
Lumina’s solution also uses only a single laser to achieve its class-leading results, which is remarkable in term of also offering cost and production scale benefits. Russell says that even so, it didn’t approach the problem from the angle of optimizing for cost efficiency at the sake of performance, as some competitors have done.
In the end, Russell is still very realistic about timeframes for seeing full autonomy on the road – he notes that disengagement rates for even the best performing self-driving test cars in use today are at about one in every 1,000 miles – which compares to accident rates of about one in every 1 million miles for human drivers. That’s a large delta to make up, but Russell and Luminar think crossing the virtual Rubicon in terms of exceeding human perceptive abilities will be a big part of narrowing that gap.

52,Ford and Lyft’s new self-driving partnership likely to be a standard model,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/27/ford-and-lyfts-new-self-driving-partnership-likely-to-be-a-standard-model/,2017/09/27,"
Ford and Lyft are working together on self-driving vehicle technology, but the focus of the collaboration is around Lyft’s positioning of itself as an open platform for future autonomous on-demand vehicle services, and likely not something that will do much to accelerate the pace at which self-driving cars are able to be safely deployed on roads.
The focus of the partnership is on laying the groundwork for a future time when Lyft users will be able to open the app and call a car, which will then come from a range of different providers operating their own driverless fleets. It’s the main purpose behind Lyft’s launch of its open platform for autonomous tech, and one of the driving motivations for its Level 5 Autonomous driving center in California.
But the Ford and Lyft partnership isn’t exclusive and it’s unlikely to be unique – in fact, it’s probably going to be something that proves a model for a range of similar partnerships across networks in future. On-demand vehicle service operators could, in fact, become the cable and internet providers of the future, operating platforms that work with a range of both individually, and fleet-operator owned vehicles.
Ford is also unlikely to give up entirely on the idea of running its own autonomous driving operation – rival GM seems to be preparing for that eventuality itself, having built its own ride hailing app and network for use in San Francisco through self-driving subsidiary Cruise, which is offering on-demand autonomous rides to its employees in a limited beta test.
The automaker stands to learn a lot from operating both human-driven and self-driving test vehicles on Lyft’s network, both of which it plans to do as part of this new partnership, because it has precious little experience with operating a ride-hailing service, while Lyft has plenty. It’s going to be able to glean a ton of useful information about user experience and ride planning from the partnership, regardless of what happens in the future with any commercial partnerships.
As for helping get self-driving cars on the road, this could perhaps accelerate progress – but the fact remains that we’re still quite a ways off from fully autonomous vehicles operating without humans behind the wheel on public roads in any kind of widespread way. And the limiting factors are on the self-driving technology side, not the network piece of the equation.
Meanwhile, I’d expect that Ford won’t be the last automaker to make this kind of arrangement with Lyft – there’s little to be lost from not joining up with its platform now, and a lot to be gained in terms of planning for a future where mobility looks quite different than it does today.

53,Ford becomes the latest automotive giant to work with Lyft on self-driving cars,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/27/ford-lyft-self-driving-cars/,2017/09/27,"
Unlike Uber and China’s Didi, Lyft isn’t developing its own self-driving cars. But the U.S. company sure is signing up major names to help it bridge the gap.
This week it announced Ford as its latest autonomous car partner. Ford joins big names Jaguar, GM and Alphabet’s Waymo as well startups Nutonomy and Drive.ai as Lyft allies.
Recently recognized as top of the industry when it comes to self-driving cars, Ford said recently that it is committed to working with partners to bring its vehicles to market in ways that actually help consumers. One such early partner is Dominos Pizza — because self-driving cars for pizza deliveries… — while has been testing the social aspect of self-driving cars through an interesting trial that featured a man driving a car while disguised as a seat.
Taxis is an obvious areas for the company to push into, but there isn’t likely to be any immediate impact. The duo appear to be taking a ‘slow and steady wins the race’ approach.
That’s according to a blog post from Ford’s Sherif Marakby — who heads up autonomous and electric vehicles within the automotive giant — which also appeared to pour shade on Uber, which is also his former employer:
Some view the opportunity with self-driving vehicles as a race to be first. But we are focusing our efforts on building a service based around actual people’s needs and wants. We are placing a high priority on safety and dependability so customers will trust the experience that our self-driving technology will one day enable.
2017 has been a year of progress for Lyft, achieved in no small measure thanks to a series of disasters for Uber.
Lyft reached one million daily rides in July and, while that lags Uber’s daily average of 5.5 million worldwide, data reported by Bloomberg weeks later suggested that Lyft is actually growing faster than its rival.
Revelations of sexual harassment in the workplace, former CEO Travis Kalanick being caught of video berating a driver, and the use of a controversial greyball program to side-step law enforcement officials are among the disasters that eventual led to Kalanick quitting the company in June.

Dyson, maker of high-tech vacuum cleaners and fans, has long been rumored to be getting into the car game. That’s no longer a rumor, as the company has confirmed that it’s working on a battery electric vehicle with an all-electric drivetrain to be launched by 2020.
The news comes from Dyson founder James Dyson himself, who announced the project via an internal company-wide email. The email details how Dyson’s original vision for the cyclonic motor that’s a trademark ingredient in its hand dryers and vacuums was originally inspired by a desire to take emissions from diesel engines out of the air.
That original diesel capture system didn’t catch on as Dyson would’ve hoped, but it would eventually prove the basis for the motors it uses in its own vacuums, including battery-powered cordless options that combine power and efficiency. Dyson says that his goal and the goal of his company, however remained reduction of global pollution levels.

That’s why they’re combining the efforts of a variety of their teams, and expertise built to create their other consumer products in one effort to develop this battery electric car. Dyson has a team consisting of its “top” engineers, including a number of automotive industry veterans, that number over 400 already, and it’s set to invest nearly $3 billion in the project.
Dyson is staying mum on info beyond that it’s working on a car and hopes to have it on the road by 2020. We knew this was likely coming, thanks to hires and other info, but it’s still exciting to see the UK-based global tech leader enter the fray in a field very different from where it’s had previous success.

55,Daimler answers Elon Musk’s Twitter challenge on EVs,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/daimler-answers-elon-musks-twitter-challenge-on-evs/,2017/09/26,"
Elon Musk uses Twitter to express his thoughts frankly and directly, and he just took issue with a USA Today story about the size of a rival automaker’s bet on electric vehicle technology. Musk noted that the reported $1 billion Daimler was spending on taking on Tesla was not enough for such a large company – and Daimler agreed.
In response to Musk’s tweet that the $1 billion figure cited in the USA Today tweet was too low, Daimler said that the Tesla CEO was “absolutely right” and then pointed out that it’s actually investing over $10 billion, including its next generation EV spend on top of its $1 billion investment in battery production alone.

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 25, 2017



Musk didn’t actually prompt any change in Daimler’s plans (or not in this tweet anyway – Tesla as a company has had an impact on the EV industry at large that’s hard to quantify). Instead, Musk was guilty of that cardinal Twitter sin: Not clicking through and assuming the whole story is the headline or 140 character summary. Jalopnik’s Dean Kawamura pointed this out, but Musk’s cheeky answer could either be a straight up joke, or a reference to the fact that Tesla has changed the game for EVs. I prefer to interpret it as the latter.

China’s Didi Chuxing is already well-known for making investments, but this time around the ride-sharing company has stepped beyond backing companies in its core industry with its latest deal.
That’s because Didi has backed RenRenChe, China-based online peer-to-peer car marketplace, via a strategic investment that is confirmed at $200 million. It’s not clear what it’s valuation is post-money, but in its last round, a year ago, the company was valued at $500 million, so doing some straight math and assuming RenRenChe has not raised at a down-round, it’s now at least $700 million.
Didi is valued at over $50 billion and its on-demand car empire stretches beyond China, where it remains in the process of buying Uber’s local business.
The firm has links in Europe, South America, India, Southeast Asia, the U.S. and the Middle East thanks to investments in the likes of Taxify, 99, Ola, Grab, Lyft and Careem. With the RenRenChe deal, Uber is adding peer-to-peer trading to its stack of services in China, which spans basic taxi services, buses, test driving, dock-less bikes and more.
Three-year-old RenRenChe is a classified site that allows car owners to sell directly to other consumers. It covers over 80 Chinese cities, and it claims 100,000 car listings.
As part of the deal, Didi said it will look to integrate RenRenChe’s service into its apps, while it will contribute to helping with R&D and technical development. A spokesperson confirmed that there is no plan to take the integration overseas with Didi’s global partners, however.
RenRenChe’s other investors include Redpoint, Tencent and Shunwei Capital, among others. The company, according to Crunchbase, has raised about $460 million to date (including this latest round).

Not a minimalist? Startups will gladly store, manage and deliver your items
The state of the unicorn




When it comes to startup investment, carmakers are all over the road.
Over the past two years, we’ve seen a massive spike in venture funding by major auto manufacturers. Deal counts are up, more automakers are investing and more big rounds are getting done.
However, an analysis of Crunchbase funding data for the 20 largest global automakers finds wide variance in investment sizes, timing and strategic focus. Some automakers have focused on unicorns and mega-rounds, while others are active at the early stage. Still others have yet to park much capital in startups, illustrating a long-term reticence to engage actively in the venture space.
None of this is especially surprising to industry insiders. Automakers “operate at a different clock speed than the technology industry,” said Chris Stallman, a partner at Fontinalis Partners, a transport-focused venture firm with offices in Detroit and Boston. Five to seven-year vehicle product cycles make startup partnerships difficult because there is uncertainty about whether the company will still be around when a car comes to market.
That said, it’s no secret that automakers have shown more interest in startups lately. Nor is it any secret what’s driving that surge, given the massive shifts the industry faces from the rise of electric cars, autonomous vehicles, ride-hailing services and other emerging technologies and transportation business models.
Below, we set out to quantify combined investment by automakers in startups of all stripes, along with acquisitions, with a focus on how individual automakers compare.
Deal pace speeds up
First we look at deal count. Broadly, funding records for the past five years show a dramatic rise in startup investment beginning in 2016 and revving up further in 2017.
In the chart below, we look at the number of disclosed venture and seed rounds with participation by the major automakers. Keep in mind, these are only disclosed rounds, so the actual number of investments may be quite a bit higher, as automakers are known to do stealth deals, as well.

Deal-making isn’t concentrated in any particular sub-sector. We see sizeable rounds, for instance, for Shift, a car-selling platform; ChargePoint, a provider of electric vehicle charging stations; Turo, a provider of peer-to-peer car sharing; StoreDot, a battery developer and Momentum.ai, an autonomous-driving startup.
Car companies aren’t just doing more deals; they’re doing bigger investments. In all, automakers participated in at least eight mega-rounds ($100 million or more) this year, up from zero a few years ago. In the following chart,we look at mega-rounds over the past five years:

Ride apps have dominated so far this year, with at least four companies in the space securing mega-rounds with automaker participation: Via, Grab, Gett and Careem. Autonomous vehicles were also big, with Nauto and ArgoAI scoring mega-rounds.
Carmaker M&A
While it was a big year for startup investment by automakers, M&A has been slower. That’s not abnormal, as car companies generally don’t buy a lot of startups, although they do the occasional big deal or smaller asset purchase.
So far this year, we haven’t seen any large M&A transactions involving automakers. The most recent large-dollar purchase was GM’s purchase of self-driving technology startup Cruise Automation for $1 billion in 2016.
The latest deal, Volvo’s purchase this month of valet parking app developer Luxe, by contrast, was a smaller asset sale involving a startup that had ceased offering its service. Other recent deals, including Ford’s purchase of commuter transit provider Chariot, and PSA Group’s acquisition of online auto repair platform Autobutler, were smaller deals involving early-stage companies.
Whether they opt to partner or acquire, however, automakers are cultivating more relationships with startups, Stallman told Crunchbase News. The global recession of 2008-2009 required heavy cuts to R&D for many struggling automakers, and in the last couple of years they’ve been playing catch-up. Bringing in an outside startup can be a good way to speed up internal efforts.
How the biggest automakers stack up
Not everyone’s operating at the same speed, however. Some automakers like venture investing a lot more than others.
Looking at deal count, Germany’s BMW was the most active automaker by a wide margin, with more than 30 disclosed investments since 2012, including 10 so far this year. A majority are through its corporate fund, BMW iVentures, which invests across multiple sectors, including autonomous driving, electric vehicles, AI and automotive cloud technology.
Although most deals are Series A or B, BMW i Ventures invests across stages, and many of its early-stage rounds are quite large. This summer, the fund participated in a $38 million Series C for Shift, and a $159 million Series B for Nauto, a developer of AI-enabled camera technology for automotive fleets.
Germany’s Daimler was also quite active in 2017, with eight investments, including participation in two mega-rounds for two ride apps, New York-based Via and Dubai-based Careem.
In the chart below, we look at the number of disclosed investments since last year by major automakers:

A few automakers have so far stayed out of startup investing. Fiat Chrysler, in particular, has been reticent to invest, although a recent self-driving car partnership with Google demonstrates an interest in partnering with Silicon Valley companies. Nissan and Mazda have also shown little appetite for VC.
The road ahead
Looking ahead, it’s not far-fetched to presume that the momentum for startup investing among automakers will continue. If anything, signs point to further acceleration, with Toyota recently unveiling a $100 million AI-focused venture fund and Ford scaling up its tech-focused Ford Smart Mobility division.
Moreover, if any industry’s investment activities are going to follow Newton’s first law of thermodynamics, it ought to be transportation.

58,Ford is now designing cars in mixed reality using Microsoft HoloLens,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/22/ford-is-now-designing-cars-in-mixed-reality-using-microsoft-hololens/,2017/09/22,"
Ford is making cars using Microsoft’s HoloLens mixed reality headset, as part of a new test project the automaker is rolling out globally. The mixed reality design trial allows for rapid prototyping in a virtual environment, instead of having to create new physical models to see what new materials and angles will look like on a final design.
Old clay models aren’t going the way of the dodo – using HoloLens means that designers can combine the physical and the virtual, to see how different materials will look on an actual scale version of the physical. This reduces the process of making and reviewing changes from weeks down to days, which is a massive time savings when it comes to car design.
HoloLens also means that collaborating can be digitized in clever ways, including allowing the recording and sharing of high-tech virtual mixed media “sticky notes,” which can be appended to specific spots on the vehicle.
It isn’t the first time that automakers have turned to virtual and mixed reality in developing their designs: electric Tesla competitor Lucid told me they’ve used HTC Vive and VR extensively in designing their vehicle, in order to help keep down the time and cost it takes to iterate between prototypes.

This is still just a test at this stage, but Ford is looking at how to bring HoloLens and mixed reality into more of its engineering work, the company says. It’s definitely a smart fit for use of the still relatively nascent world of AR.
Epson’s Moverio augmented reality headset was also designed specifically for this kind of use, but it was perhaps too early to provoke broad adoption. But HoloLens and system-level Windows 10 support could help make the difference.

59,Baidu announces $1.5B fund to back self-driving car startups,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/21/baidu-announces-1-5b-fund-to-back-self-driving-car-startups/,2017/09/21,"
Baidu is putting some serious cash behind its self-driving car push after it announced a $1.5 billion fund that’s focused on backing autonomous driving tech companies.
The Chinese giant, best known for its internet search service and AI technology, has prioritized autonomous vehicles in a major way in recent years, so this comes as little surprise. Baidu made its Apollo self-driving car platform freely available to the auto industry earlier this year. That quickly picked up partners and it currently claims around 70, including Hyundai, Bosch, Continental, Nvidia, Microsoft Cloud, Velodyne, TomTom, UCAR and Grab.
Now Baidu — which is testing autonomous vehicles in both China and the U.S. — is doubling down with capital via this new fund, which it said will aim to support around 100 companies over the next three years.
Baidu also shipped a major update to Apollo this week, which added five core capabilities to its platform: obstacle perception, planning, cloud simulation, high-definition (HD) maps and end-to-end deep learning.
This is the second large-scale investment firm Baidu has launched in recent times. Last month, it uncorked a $1.5 billion fund in partnership with China Life Insurance Group targeted at late-stage deals with companies with “significant association” with China.

60,Tesla said to be working on its own self-driving AI chip with AMD,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/20/tesla-said-to-be-working-on-its-own-self-driving-ai-chip-with-amd/,2017/09/20,"
Tesla is reportedly developing its own processor for artificial intelligence, intended for use with its self-driving systems, in partnership with AMD. Tesla has an existing relationship with Nvidia, whose GPUs power its Autopilot system, but this new in-house chip reported by CNBC could potentially reduce its reliance on third-party AI processing hardware.
AMD would help provide Tesla with development of the chip. The electric carmaker has apparently already received the first samples of its processor prototype for testing, according to the report. Building a specific chip designed entirely for autonomous driving would help Tesla in a number of ways, including gaining more control over a key aspect of its own supply chain, and increasing overall system efficiency and performance.
Tesla has claimed that its current generation vehicles have all the hardware and computing capability on board to achieve full self-driving with a software update in the future. But the company is also always iterating on its hardware, eschewing the traditional model year upgrades of legacy automakers.
Tesla’s autopilot business is run by Jim Keller, who previously spent much of his career at AMD, and then at Apple, where he helped design the Apple A4 and A5 in-house processors. Keller’s key role at the company would likely have influenced the automaker to drive towards owning its own processor design to more closely align its self-driving software and compute hardware components.

Delphi is planning to launch its own autonomous driving solution for car manufacturers and mobility service fleet operators in 2019, and it announced today that it will use BlackBerry QNX as the operating system for the automated drive solution.
Both BlackBerry QNX and Delphi are long-time auto industry stalwarts who have been reconfiguring their businesses to focus on the opportunity represented by the advent of autonomous driving tech. Delphi has split its business, spinning of its powertrain arm to focus primarily on autonomy and high-tech offerings; BlackBerry QNX has shifted from a focus on infotainment solutions to software that underpins and secures self-driving.
Partnerships like this one will benefit both in terms of helping make sure that they can become key technology supply players as automakers move towards automated vehicle deployment. Delphi specifically is looking at BlackBerry QNX’s track record in safe and secure automotive software as a way to help kickstart its autonomous platform development and get it ready for real-world deployment, where it’ll face intrusion and hacking attempts.

63,Electric scooter maker Gogoro raises $300 million for growth,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/19/gogoro-closes-300m/,2017/09/19,"
Electric scooter maker Gogoro has closed a massive $300 million Series C round to expand its service.
The company has sold scooters in its native Taiwan since 2015, and it Europe it offers them on a short-term rental basis. That’s in Berlin, Germany, and Paris, France, where Gogoro provides a combined 1,600 scooters for an on-demand sharing service that’s operated by Bosch subsidiary Coup.
Gogoro said today it has sold over 34,000 scooters, which, combined with its rental efforts, have led to customers riding over 100 million kms to date — and saving an apparent 4.1 million liters of gasoline that would otherwise have been used.
 
The company is saying less about its immediate plans, however. But from the shape of its investors we can guess that it is planning further expansions in Europe and moves into Japan and Southeast Asia.
That’s because this new funding comes from new backers Singaporean sovereign fund Temasek, London-based Generation Investment Management, Japan’s Sumitomo Corporation, and energy firm ENGIE from France.
“Cities worldwide are demanding new and sustainable approaches to personal transportation. Gogoro is poised for strong growth. We believe its exciting brand and visionary business model will play a critical role in driving the electrification of mobility across Southeast Asia,” Generation Investment Management’s Colin le Duc said in the only investment that hinted at specific future markets.
Gogoro also played up its swappable battery technology, which could hint at future products and services, too.
“One of the greatest challenges of our time is transitioning our cities to a smarter and more sustainable energy and transportation infrastructure. Gogoro provides a new approach for cities to embrace sustainable energy through a smart connected infrastructure and battery swapping system that has demonstrated success across Taiwan and Berlin,” co-founder and CEO Horace Luke added.
Gogoro had previously raised $150 million while in pre-sale stealth mode.

64,Udacity adds a new ‘Intro to Self-Driving Cars’ Nanodegree,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/19/udacity-adds-a-new-intro-to-self-driving-cars-nanodegree/,2017/09/19,"
You likely won’t be surprised when I tell you that building a self-driving car is difficult and complex. Udacity has tried to help address that difficulty with flexible, online education for self-driving engineers through its Self-Driving Cars Nanodegree program, and now it’s expanding its offerings with a new Intro to Self-Driving Cars Nanodegree being introduced at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2017 that’s designed to help funnel more talent into the intermediate-level course, and from there into the workforce, where demand is incredibly strong and growing.
Udacity’s Nanodegrees are designed from the start to help democratize education in areas of tech where there’s a strong appetite from the employer side, and not nearly enough talent to go around. But what the company found with its self-driving material was that it was actually quite advanced compared to the skill level of interested students, so it set out to create a kind of fundamentals introductory program to help make sure more could enter the main course with a better foundation.
“When we launched Self-Driving Car, we thought it was more of a niche product, because very few kids go to college thinking ‘I want to become a self-driving car engineer’,” explained Udacity founder and former self-driving car project lead at Google, Sebastian Thrun. “But it became this unbelievably successful thing for us, not just from a student perspective, but also from an industry perspective. But the one complaint we got from lots of our student base was ‘Look, this is really tough.'”
“With the program we have right now, you have to be a really good software engineer just to get through it,” he added.
The introductory program will still focus on practical application of learned material, of course, but it will seek to establish strength in basic topics including Bayesian Thinking, Matrices, C++ Basics, Performance and Modeling, Algorithmic Thinking, and Computer Vision to name a few. It’ll cost $800 for the entire four-month course, and registration starts today with the first class opening to students on October 10.

Also new to this program, and again in the spirit of increasing access to education for these very high demand skills, Udacity is teaming up with Lyft, which will be providing 400 full scholarships (covering the total $800 value) for the Intro program. Applications for those open today, too.
I spoke to Lyft’s Chief Strategy Officer Raj Kapoor about Lyft’s goals with these scholarships. In part, it’s to help identify potential talent for the company’s new Silicon Valley-based Level 5 self-driving Engineering Center, but it’s also about offering up opportunity to a diverse group of students who might not otherwise have access to this kind of education, a goal it shares in common with Udacity.
“Technology is not as diverse as we would like, especially around underserved communities, whether it’s by gender, like women, or if it’s by race, for example African-Americans and Hispanic Latino communities, and Native Americans – all those are below the percentage of the population in terms of representation,” explained Kapoor. “And so we felt like, is there a way to get some of those people attracted into this, why don’t we give away 400 scholarships over the next year targeted to those people.”
Udacity’s initial cohort for its intermediate Self-Driving Nanodegree hasn’t even graduated yet, but already 60 students enrolled in the program have secured jobs with hiring partners including BMW, Lockheed, Volvo and others, Thrun points out. The program is also immensely popular with students, with 10,000 enrolled students selected from a pool of 42,000 total applicants. The first group of 415 students graduates from the program on October 16.

While that program has had success and worked well for anyone with an extensive programming background, the new Intro course is intended to broaden the pool to also include even those with minimal programming experience to get into the field. Graduates also get guaranteed acceptance into the existing Self-Driving program, which likely puts them on a path toward employment in the industry.
Udacity is also bringing in professional racer driver Danica Patrick as a new spokesperson for the regular Self-Driving Car Program, which seems a bit counterintuitive at first glance, since her whole job is achieving manual driving excellence. I’ll be asking Thrun about that on stage today at Disrupt SF 2017.
It’s obviously still not easy to become a successful self-driving vehicle engineer, but Udacity is providing a targeted way to acquire skills that are often broken up across diverse fields of study, on a schedule and in a place that suits a student’s needs.

65,You can learn to build aerial taxis with Udacity’s new Flying Car Nanodegree,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/19/you-can-learn-to-build-aerial-taxis-with-udacitys-new-flying-car-nanodegree/,2017/09/19,"
Online education company Udacity is growing its new Nanodegree program yet again – it’s adding two entirely new programs to the roster, including a new entry-level self-driving Nanodegree, as well as a brand new one focused on ‘flying cars’ (though it’s actually a bit more nuanced than that).
The Flying Car program will include course material created by world-leading aeronautics and aerospace industry experts, including MIT professor Nicholas Roy, ETH Zurich professor and Kiva Systems co-founder Raffaelo D’Andrea, University of Toronto Aerospace Studies professor Angela Schoellig and Udacity founder Sebastian Thrun himself. Thrun is also CEO of personal aircraft startup Kitty Hawk, which is also acting as a hiring partner for the new program to provide job opportunity for Nanodegree grads.
Despite its name, however, the Flying Car program isn’t actually all that focused on flying cars – its mandate covers a range of future transportation tech, and includes education material around drones, including quadcopters with self-flying capabilities and remote-controlled aircraft.
MIT’s Roy calls the ‘Flying Car’ name a “metaphor” in a blog post announcing the new program, and Udacity CEO Sebastian Thrun told me in an interview that there was some internal date about using the name at all. The curriculum is going to focus primarily on fundamentals of autonomous flight, including path and motion planning, vehicle control and perception sensor systems.
VC Steve Jurveston on a Kitty Hawk Flyer.
This should produce Nanodegree holders with skill sets that can scale to match the opportunity – from practical applications today in areas like commercial drone asset monitoring, to a future where short-range autonomous cargo and even passenger transportation is a viable real world tech.
“Today, the self-driving car is a much more present thing in terms of politicians thinking about it, and society thinking about it,” explained Thrun. “But one of the things that I am afforded here in Silicon Valley is to understand where the world is going. I firmly believe that flight, be it drones for package delivery, or what we do at Kitty Hawk where we build vehicles for passenger transport, that those things have a big future.”
Flying cars aren’t exactly the flight of fancy they once were, either; a range of companies, including Thrun’s Kitty Hawk, but also including Airbus and even Uber, are either building autonomous personal transportation systems themselves, or doing a lot to encourage their development. Some of the big remaining challenges that stand in the way of this kind of tech becoming the real deal include the very subjects being taught in the program – of course, identifying and providing resources where the market is underserved is what Udacity’s Nanodegrees are all about.

“What we decided to do is take a topic that I think will be a big job field in a short amount of time, and convey those skills,” Thrun said. “There’s not a single flying car educational program in the world, not even remotely. So we take these basic things like autonomy, and perception and controls for flight vehicles and package them into a program.”
The program is intended for advanced students with strong programming skills, like the existing Self-Driving Car Nanodegree, and it’s intended to prepare students for entering the workforce. But Like flying cars themselves, the nanodegree program isn’t here quite yet; it’s set to open for applicants in 2018, however, which is likely a lot sooner than you’ll see autonomous flying taxis criss-crossing city skies.

66,AR helmet startup Skully may have risen from the dead,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/19/ar-helmet-startup-skully-may-have-risen-from-the-dead/,2017/09/19,"
It seems Skully, the AR helmet company that crashed and burned in July of 2016 after the former CEO Marcus Weller refused to sign a confidentiality deal with investors is trying to make a comeback.
A letter sent to those who had previously subscribed to the Skully email list, and obtained by TechCrunch, says new company SKULLY Technologies is bringing back the helmet.
Interestingly, cousins and new co-founders of the company Ivan Contreras and Rafael Contreras say in the letter they have purchased the company and relocated it to Atlanta, Georgia in an attempt to fulfill SKULLY’s “destiny.”
It appears the Contreras cousins have “refounded” a number of previously existing companies, including an electric bike company called TORROT, which was a company created in the 1980s formerly known as GASGAS.
We’d heard a lot of talk about various entities possibly purchasing the bones of what was left of Skully when it went down in flames last year, but it’s not clear if the new SKULLY holds the rights to the former company’s IP or how soon it may be offering the new helmets for purchase. However, a high-tech bike helmet would fit nicely within the Contreras’s company interests, and it makes sense the two would want to see the helmet through to production.
While the letter stresses this new SKULLY is different from the now bankrupt company it is based on, it hints of possibly delivering the helmets to those who previously purchased them or contributed to the making of the helmets under the old company.
“Although SKULLY Technologies has no formal obligation to the customers of the now defunct SKULLY, Inc., we recognize that hundreds of SKULLY helmet enthusiasts around the world have contributed to this product and were understandably disappointed that they never received one. We are determined to make this right,” the letter states.
Note, the letter does not explicitly say it will deliver helmets to those who had purchased them from the previous Skully, and it’s not clear at this time what “make this right” means. A couple of people who received the letter today have also told TechCrunch they are skeptical of ever getting the helmet for which they paid thousands.
We’ve reached out to the new co-founders to learn more and will be sure to update you if and when they let us know more. In the meantime, please send any tips you might have to sarah dot buhr at techcrunch dot com.
Here’s the letter in full below:

You are receiving this email because you are part of the SKULLY Nation and we are bringing back the SKULLY helmet.
We are happy to inform you that the assets of SKULLY, Inc., have been acquired by Ivan Contreras and Rafael Contreras, successful businessmen in a variety of global turnaround industrial and technology ventures, with the goal of fulfilling SKULLY’s destiny.
Ivan Contreras, President of the new company SKULLY Technologies, assembled a new leadership team and has located the headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia.
SKULLY Technologies is unrelated to the former SKULLY, Inc., which filed bankruptcy and is no longer in business.  Although SKULLY Technologies has no formal obligation to the customers of the now defunct SKULLY, Inc., we recognize that hundreds of SKULLY helmet enthusiasts around the world have contributed to this product and were understandably disappointed that they never received one.
We are determined to make this right.
We will be sharing more updates soon on SKULLY and the revival of the SKULLY Nation.

67,Nikola and Bosch team on powertrain design for hydrogen electric long-haul trucks,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/19/nikola-and-bosch-team-on-powertrain-design-for-hydrogen-electric-long-haul-trucks/,2017/09/19,"
Nikola Motor Company, the Utah-based company that is working on building heavy-duty transport trucks using hybrid hydrogen-electric powertrains, announced today that it’s partnering with global automotive industry supply leader Bosch to design and build said powertrains. The company also revealed the first ever image of its Nikola Two truck design (above), with a smaller, ‘day cab’ style design but similar range and performance to the Nikola One long-haul semi truck.
Nikola (yes, which takes its name from electrical engineer, inventor and futurist Nikola Tesla) is hoping to bring to market its Nikola One and Two trucks by 2021, offering Class 8 multi-axle heavy load transport trucks that produce no direct emissions in the form of exhaust thanks to an electric drivetrain, which can achieve true long haul range thanks to the use of hydrogen hybrid technology to extend beyond the max range available to battery-only vehicles.
Nikola will use Bosch’s eAxle design to help bring their truck to market as fast as possible, and will work with Bosch on building the first ever true dual-motor commercial-vehicle eAxle intended for long-haul trucking. The eAxle itself is, as you might guess from the name, a vehicle axle connecting the truck’s wheels – but It also contains the electric motor, power electronics and the transmission in a single, modular unit.
Nikola One rendering
Bosch has ample experience developing the eAxle, so that should help considerably in easing the challenge of bringing Nikola’s technically challenging vision to market. The two companies will also work together on building the vehicle’s overall powertrain.
Tesla is set to unveil its own fully electric semi truck at an event next month, but we don’t yet know when it’ll make it to market. The Tesla truck could reportedly have some autonomous capabilities, but will likely have a range of at most around 300 miles per charge, something Nikola’s hybrid design can easily top with an estimated range of 1,200 miles on a full tank of 220 lbs of hydrogen.

68,DFJ’s Steve Jurvetson thinks Elon’s Boring Co. will win with short tunnels first,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/18/dfjs-steve-jurvetson-thinks-elons-boring-co-will-win-with-short-tunnels-first/,2017/09/18,"
Noted Silicon Valley investor and SpaceX investor Steve Jurvetson is probably better positioned than most to know what Elon Musk is thinking with The Boring Company, his project to build a better tunnel boring concern, which he created essentially because he was fed up with sitting in traffic in L.A.
Though The Boring Co.’s most recent headlines have hailed Musk’s plans to potentially build a city-to-city underground hyperloop network, Jurvetson talked about the near-term potential of shorter tunnels, and tunnels designed specifically for electric vehicles.



“I personally love the idea even more than the hyperloop idea,” Jurvetson told TechCrunch’s Connie Loizos on stage at Disrupt SF 2017 in San Francisco. Why? Because the vision is that they could work with electric vehicles exclusively once those proliferate enough, which means you don’t need to manage exhaust, Jurvetson pointed out.
“The whole concept of tunnels changes,” he said, once you change that key ingredient, since tunnels can be much smaller, making them easier to dig and interconnect and overlay. That means less complexity, less potential to affect surface structure and easier construction, enabling things like short undercut routes that bypass busy freeways currently clogged with traffic – some of which just happens to be using the same route as others headed to the same concentrated focal point, like an airport, even if they’re going somewhere else entirely.
While hyperloop tunnels still make sense over longer distances, Jurvetson thinks those are still very expensive, complex projects that are a long way off. In the nearer term, EV undercut routes across shorter distance seem “a little simpler,” he said.
Once laid out, this makes plenty of obvious sense. But again, it raises the question of how Musk come up with this stuff. Jurvetson had a great answer.
“Think forward 500 years, what is the inevitable endpoint that no one will debate?” he says the prolific founder asks himself. He then figures out what it’ll take to get there, and what opportunities available along the way will make it happen.

69,Lyft envisions future streets that actually reduce lanes to cut back traffic,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/18/lyft-envisions-future-streets-that-actually-reduce-lanes-to-cut-back-traffic/,2017/09/18,"
Lyft’s focus on future autonomy isn’t just about partnering with self-driving car companies like Drive.ai, or with providing an open network upon which an autonomous ride hailing service can be built – it’s also working with design firms and other stakeholders to try to foresee future streets intentionally built to facilitate autonomous transportation.
This is another example of Lyft’s big-picture thinking around autonomy and the future of mobility services – its co-founders, and particularly President John Zimmer, have expressed expansive, blue sky visions of autonomous future in the past. Now, it shared with CNN a potential blueprint for what a redesigned major roadway in traffic-choked Los Angeles might become with some relatively near-to-hand autonomous tech actually running on roads.
Lyft’s vision, created with architectural firm Perkins+Will and transportation consultant agency Nelson/Nygaard, actually reduces the 10-lane current design of LA’s Wilshire Boulevard down to just three narrowed lanes for cars, along with dedicated lanes for autonomous buses. The idea is to incentive shared, self-driving modes over individual, manually driven vehicles – while also opening up green space and pedestrian- and bike-friendly lanes, too.
The road design has a wider sidewalk, along with park-like fixtures including benches. These would work in tandem with the dedicated bus lanes and autonomous multi-passenger vehicles, to provide space that’s enjoyable while you wait.
It’s not generally terribly surprising in terms of how it looks compared to idealized visions of future cities, but it does point out very directly how we might be able to reclaim a significant portion of current urban square footage for resident use – even in the near future, with limited implementation of autonomous vehicle tech. Bus routes, especially dedicated ones, are relatively uncomplicated compared to open self-driving in existing city streets, shared with human-driven vehicles. We could seem them implemented long before consumer have ready access to autonomous technologies at the level of the individual car.

70,Waymo taps Intel for self-driving computers it develops entirely in-house,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/18/waymo-taps-intel-for-self-driving-computers-it-develops-entirely-in-house/,2017/09/18,"
Waymo has made a point of going in-house for the core technology of its self-driving system, which is something it has talked about specifically around its sensor suite in the past. The company revealed today that it also built its own compute hardware for sensor fusion and autonomous decision-making, pathfinding and more – and it’s working with Intel for the chips that power that onboard computing capability.
Waymo’s autonomous Chrysler Pacifica minivans, its latest generation self-driving test platform, have Intel-based compute for everything from connectivity to sensor data processing, which is what provides the basis of their autonomy, which allows for self-driving even in city conditions. Intel says it’s also going to work with Waymo on increasing the system’s overall power and efficiency in order to help it achieve true Level 4 and 5 autonomy across driving conditions in real-world applications.
This is another example of Intel’s drive to be at the forefront of autonomy and self-driving; already, it represents a significant portion of the chipmaker’s business, even though many typically associate their core skills as being focused in the PC business. In fact, through its work with Waymo, which began back in 2009 when it was still Google’s Self-Driving Car program, Intel’s chips have helped process data for Waymo resulting from more cumulative autonomous miles driven than any other test fleet currently in operation.
“As the most advanced vehicles on the road today, our self-driving cars require the highest-performance compute to make safe driving decisions in real-time,” explained Waymo CEO John Krafcik in a statement to TechCrunch. “Intel’s technology supports the advanced processing inside our vehicles, with the ability to manufacture to meet Waymo’s needs at scale.”

While Waymo has made use of Intel tech in some form or another for nearly a decade, their most recent collaboration brought the two companies closer together, Waymo tells me. The two companies collaborated at the design stage when developing Waymo’s unique compute, which it built from the ground up specifically for its in-house sensor stack and self-driving software architecture.
In the increasingly competitive self-driving technology market, Waymo has a couple of key advantages, including its many years of experience working on the problem. But its in-house hardware, sensor suite and computing capability may end up being its biggest edge, since that allows it to uniquely tailor all aspects of the system for maximum effectiveness (which is what Apple does with its consumer tech gadgets).
In a market that increasingly looks like it’ll have a range of suppliers seeking to offer off-the-shelf systems and components, Waymo owning its own sensor and compute tech could be a major distinguishing factor. If one member of the field is likely to stand out from the rest once autonomous driving matures, owning more of the stack is a good candidate for something that helps one solution stand out from the rest in terms of efficacy, efficiency, user experience and more.
We’ve got Intel CEO Brian Kraznich on stage today at Disrupt at 1 PM PT, so we’ll be talking to him about this partnership and much more. Check out the live stream below to tune in:

71,Ford and Mahindra explore strategic cooperation around car tech in India,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/18/ford-and-mahindra-explore-strategic-cooperation-around-car-tech-in-india/,2017/09/18,"
Ford and Indian automaker and mobility company Mahindra Group have entered into a new agreement to explore a potential strategic partnership focused on a number of different areas, including mobility, electrifications, connected vehicles and transportation infrastructure and more.
Ford and Mahindra’s initial cooperation period extends for three years, during which time the general idea is to identify opportunities for longer period collaboration. Mahindra, which manufactures cars in India as well as a range of commercial vehicles including tractors, as well as aerospace technology, would provide Ford with key expertise in operating in the potentially lucrative market. For Mahindra, gaining access to Ford’s growing expertise in connected and autonomous technology could be a significant upside.
While Ford has been a presence in the Indian auto market since 1995, and exports vehicles from its facilities in Chennai, Tamil Nadu and Sanadn, Gujarat, teaming up with Mahindra could give it more opportunity to explore future focuses of its expanded business, which increasingly looks at fleet operations, connected mobility services and more.

Porsche’s first all-electric car will go on sale at the end of 2019, the car maker revealed at this year’s Frankfurt Motor Show, with pricing similar to the current Porsche Panamera, so likely starting around at least $80,000 or so in the U.S.
The Mission E was revealed originally back in 2015, but it’s now entering the final stages of development before actually shipping, according to Car Magazine. The Mission E has an entirely electric powertrain, and is set to occupy a spot between the Panamera and the 911 in Porsche’s overall vehicle lineup. It’s a four-door sports car, and is gearing up for its initial public prototype tests.

We don’t have final stats yet for the car and its specs, but we do know that the original concept had a 600bhp motor, and could help Porsche go head-to-head with Tesla’s Model S. It has four-wheel drive, and could get from 0-60 mph in under 3.5 seconds. Its speed tops out at over 155 mph, too.
As for charge, it could get as much as 300 miles on a single full battery. It’ll also have 350kW fast-charging.

73,A closer look at the all-new 2018 Nissan Leaf,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/16/a-closer-look-at-the-all-new-2018-nissan-leaf/,2017/09/16,"
Nissan’s new Leaf is the updated version of one of the pioneers of the modern all-electric consumer car, and the change is a promising one. The new vehicle offers 150 miles of range based on EPA estimates, which is a lot more than its predecessor at 107 miles (if off a bit when compared to other modern EVs like the Chevrolet Bolt).
For Nissan, it’s being positioned as the first EV that isn’t an “EV” first – it’s just a car, in other words, like any other, but it happens to have a fully electric drivetrain. The company also rethought the look and feel of the vehicle, again bringing in some more conventional, attractive lines vs. the bubble-like geometry of the last model.
Inside, it’s a more spacious vehicle, with a lot of cargo and passenger capacity for everyday use. The battery also charges faster, and can build up as much as 22 miles of range in just an hour of charging when connected to a 240V source.

Nissan has also brought a lot of advanced tech fears to the vehicle, including Android Auto, CarPlay and more. It has ProPILOT Assist, too, and is the first Nissan in the U.S. to offer the advanced driving assist features, which include maintaining speed, lane-keeping and even full breaking in highway driving.
Nissan is also promoting its Leaf-to-Home power system, which is coming to the U.S. for the first time, and which allows houses to draw energy back from the car, letting it act as a sort of backup battery for any emergency outages or other use.
Starting at $29,990 in the U.S. for the base model, the 2018 Leaf is also a bit less expensive than the 2017, which is impressive considering how much more they put into the car. It’s definitely an attractive car, and one with a lot more utilitarian appeal than Leafs that have come before. Mostly, the remaining question will be whether Nissan has done enough to make it a vehicle with more mainstream appeal.

74,Alphabet is reportedly mulling a $1B investment in Lyft,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/14/google-is-reportedly-looking-at-a-1b-investment-in-lyft/,2017/09/14,"
It’s about as good a timing as any for Lyft to capitalize on the tidal wave of negative publicity that Uber is facing right now, and it looks like it might end up with a significant investment from Alphabet in the middle of that train wreck, according to a report by Axios.
That’s not to say that this is directly related to Uber, which has a new CEO and is trying to move on from the disaster of the past few months. Still, Alphabet appears to be discussing a $1 billion investment in Lyft in an effort led by CEO Larry Page, according to the report. Lyft last raised $600 million at a $7.5 billion valuation in April.
This would be an interesting move for Google, which invested in Uber early in its life through its investment arm GV. We’d heard some murmurs of something brewing between Alphabet and Lyft for a few weeks, but it was unclear what the outcome would be. Bloomberg also reported the news this afternoon. In the end, it appears that Lyft may get a big infusion of cash to fuel its efforts to pick away at Uber — especially as it appears primed to begin its move internationally, according to a report from The Information.
A big financing round like this would go a long way for Lyft, which can use the capital to provide aggressive driver and rider benefits through promotions. Lyft may have an opportunity to snag momentum away from Uber in key cities by ramping up in marketing and discounts. That is an expensive proposition, to be sure, but Lyft also has the benefit of the wave of troubles Uber has had recently. Such a large investment would also help Lyft remain independent.
Alphabet’s self-driving division, Waymo, has been fighting with Uber in court over allegations of theft of files. Earlier this week, a judge ruled that Uber had to turn over to Waymo the due diligence report for its acquisition of Otto.
Lyft announced that it had begun self-driving car development in earnest in July, saying it would ramp up hiring and had signed a lease for a big Palo Alto facility.
Representatives from Google and Lyft have not yet responded to requests for comment.

75,Quick-charging battery startup StoreDot gets $60M on $500M valuation led by Daimler,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/14/quick-charging-battery-startup-storedot-gets-60m-on-500m-valuation-led-by-daimler/,2017/09/14,"
As we continue to see a proliferation of wireless connected devices make their way into the mainstream consumer electronics market, there has been growing attention on a key issue that will be central to making all these devices work: efficient power supplies, and specifically practical battery systems. Today, one of the startups that’s hoping to lead the conversation on how this will develop has raised a significant round of funding as it inches closer to a commercial launch.
StoreDot, a startup out of Israel that is developing a new kind of quick-charging (five minutes or less) battery to replace the lithium-ion components largely in use today in phones, electric cars and other un-wired devices, has raised $60 million in funding led by carmaker Daimler with participation also from Samsung Ventures and Norma Investments, an investment firm linked to the Russian tycoon Roman Abramovich. Daimler and Samsung have been prolific investors in autonomous car and other transportation-related startups (Samsung just earlier today signalled a new fund for this purpose; Daimler announced a round in Via just last week.)
StoreDot is not disclosing its valuation, but we understand from reliable sources close to the deal that the valuation is $500 million.
Daimler’s trucking division led the investment, and Doron Myersdorf, the CEO and co-founder of StoreDot, tells us that it will be the first ones to roll out its batteries in vehicles, expected to happen around 2020, with phone batteries coming sooner — in other words, the company has yet to launch any products. “The technology we’re developing for car batteries is similar to what we’re making for mobile,” he said in an interview. “Our focus is to get the mobile batteries to market next year.”
He also said that while Daimler’s trucks might be first in line, the plan is to integrate StoreDot’s batteries across other vehicles from the carmaker and its competitors. “We are working on the whole fleet, including luxury cars, passenger cars and buses,” Myersdorf said.
Half a billion dollars in value is a big leap forward for a startup that has raised $108 million to date. But there is a reason why companies like StoreDot are attracting a lot of attention these days.
The boom in wireless computing devices has well and truly descended upon us. From smartphones, tablets and laptops through to cordless speakers and watches, and now electric connected cars, there are more wireless devices in the world than there are people. We are fast approaching a time when it will be not just a choice but an expectation that we can use and interact with things whenever and wherever we want, not just when we’re tethered to a connection in the wall.
That brings various challenges to the tech world around computing power and network connectivity, but also how these devices will be powered, which is the challenge that StoreDot is addressing.

To do so, Myersdorf’s team is rethinking the whole concept behind the battery — an effort that has already generated 50 patents for the startup with more on the way, he said.
“We are designing a new generation of batteries,” he said, essentially rebuilding across all four components that currently make up lithium-ion batteries: the anode, the cathode, the charge transfer and the separator put in place to prevent shorts. “In order for fast charging to work, all these have to be totally redesigned because the tradition structure was focused on fast discharge, but there was no symmetry,” he said, referring to getting a charge to the battery in the first place. 
In fact, we’ve seen some very high-profile examples of just how dangerous it can be to try to quickly charge batteries that exist today: The Note 7 fiasco at Samsung (which tellingly is an investor in StoreDot) highlighted how graphite, one of the key materials in lithium-ion batteries, overheats when charged too fast. 
StoreDot’s solution, in a less-technical nutshell, brings together a new combination of nanomaterials, both organic and inorganic, to both take in the charge and hold it, without heating up in the process and shorting the battery or worse.
The company started out in its labs with a charging solution that could fill up a battery in 30 seconds (read our report on that here), but as Myersdorf describes it, it was not a practical option:
“We could charge the full battery for a phone or car in a minute or less,” he said. “The tech allows for it, but it’s a question of practicality because one minute requires a very large charger, for a phone it would need a 750-watt charger.” This, he said, would look like a brick, and “it doesn’t make commercial sense to carry a small phone and big brick next to it to charge it.”
It would be even worse for a car, which would need a one-megawatt station to charge a car to run for 300 miles. In the end, it came up with chargers that were much smaller and took five minutes to charge either a phone or car, or whatever.
Next to come for the company — and it’s not a small thing — is the fact that it has yet to get any regulatory approvals for its batteries.
“This is a major challenge because we are breaking the rules of what is known in charging,” he admitted. “This is why we are engaged with the process of trying to open and accelerate the adoption of new standards for charging, which includes the connector, the charging station, and what runs in the car [or other device].” He noted that this is another reason why the investment from Daimler and Samsung is so critical: “For a startup to push those regulatory bodies is a challenge, but if you have a large player you have better chances to get this done in a reasonable timeframe.”
Still, Myersdorf remains realistic about what StoreDot has already solved, and what lies ahead. He recognises that there have been various failures in the battery and energy storage markets, and is focused on making sure that StoreDot is not going to be the next in line.
“Now, for StoreDot it’s more of an execution risk rather than an R&D risk,” he said.

76,"Samsung launches $300M autonomous driving fund, puts $90M into TTTech",https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/14/samsung-launches-300m-autonomous-driving-fund-puts-90m-into-tttech/,2017/09/14,"
Not to be outpaced in the connected car market by other tech giants, today the world’s largest smartphone maker, Samsung, announced two major pieces of news to take its automotive strategy up a gear. It has launched the Samsung Automotive Innovation Fund, a $300 million fund to back startups and other interesting bets in the automotive market. And as a first investment out of that fund, Samsung has put €75 million (nearly $90 million) into TTTech, an Austria-based developer of platforms and safety software for connected cars, alongside a corresponding investment from Audi.
In addition to this, Samsung also announced a strategic initiative to develop connected-car technology with Harman, the auto and audio product maker that it acquired last November for $8 billion.
“During this period of extraordinary transformation in the automotive industry, we are excited to play a leadership role in supporting and shaping the future of smarter, more connected vehicles,” said Young Sohn, President and Chief Strategy Officer of Samsung Electronics and Chairman of the Board of HARMAN, in a statement. “The Autonomous/ADAS Strategic Business Unit and automotive fund reflect the company’s commitment to the values of open innovation and collaboration. In partnership with OEMs and startups, we will make the driver and passenger experience safer, more convenient, and more enjoyable.”
While giants like GM, Volkswagen and Toyota (among others) have traditionally dominated the automotive industry, the next wave of innovations that will shape how we (and other things) get from A to B is fast coming around the bend. This leaves everything to play for, as car ownership, in-car systems, and how cars will be operated are all getting disrupted and updated through technology.
That’s driving a large wave of investment. Car companies like GM, Volkswagen, Daimler and many others are putting billions of dollars towards backing a range of startups that are building technology and services for that brave new automotive future (a small handful of examples: GM investing $1 billion in Lyft, Volkswagen investing $180 million in smart car tech maker Mobvoi, and Ford pumping $1 billion into Argo AI for self-driving tech). Car makers are also investing internally in their own R&D to complement that.
Then there are the tech companies: Apple, Google and Baidu are also making large bets here, building autonomous cars of their own and also investing in and buying up talent to enhance those strategies (not without hiccups, of course).
Samsung is among those who are hoping to be at the forefront of these developments, looking at the car as the latest “hardware” that it can build and help control.
At the end of August, the company received a permit to run self-driving car tests in California, alongside an earlier permit that it got in Korea, and announcements like today’s will make sure that they will have not just their own tech, but that of partners, to put into those vehicles.
This is not Samsung’s first move to invest in automotive tech. Previous investments have included automated driving startups AImotive, Renovo; Quanergy, TetraVue, and Oculii for sensors; Autotalks and Valens for connectivity; and Graphcore for high-performance computing, the company noted.
It doesn’t look like there has been a full round amount disclosed for Samsung’s investment TTTech but we are trying to find out. Prior to today, the startup had raised around $54 million, with backers including Audi, General Electric and Infineon — another sign of the players that are hoping to have a seat at the table (or behind the wheel, if we’re looking for a relevant metaphor) in the next generation of automotive solutions.
TTTech works on road, air and aerospace systems — its systems are used in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and NASA’s Orion — but it said that Samsung’s investment will be used specifically to augment the work it has been doing with Audi on self-driving car systems for the Volkswagen Group (which owns Audi). This is about getting Samsung chips and other equipment into cars, and the companies are already showing off how the results will look:

TTTech specialises across a range of services like “functional safety, deterministic networking, real-time systems, and complex software integration” for autonomous and other automated systems, and its safety tech powers the piloting program on the Audi 8.
“Automotive advances like autonomous controls and advanced driver assistance systems will have a profound impact on society—from transforming urban spaces to bringing mobility to aging populations.   At Samsung, we see it as our responsibility to invest in the technologies that will revolutionize the way we live, work, and connect with one another,” said Samsung’s Sohn. “TTTech has demonstrated a remarkable ability to innovate and build world-class technologies and platforms. This is a seminal moment for Samsung and our Automotive Innovation Fund, and we look forward to working with leading OEMs like Audi and the entire TTTech team to set a new standard for automotive-safety technology.”
“There is already a high demand for ADAS solutions, and that demand is rapidly growing with the advancements in connected cars and autonomous driving,” said Dinesh Paliwal, President and CEO of HARMAN, in a statement. “This strategic business unit demonstrates Samsung’s and HARMAN’s commitment to answer that call – to be the definitive partner for seamless and integrated technologies. It also reflects the incredible power that Samsung and HARMAN, as a collective force, will bring to our OEM customers as we combine Samsung’s scale and resources with HARMAN’s deep automotive experience and networks. Together, we are driving the future of automotive.”
HARMAN has named John Absmeier Senior Vice President of the unit, alongside his current position as VP of smart machines.

Yes, you read that correctly: Ford put a man in a car seat disguise so that a Ford Transit could masquerade as a true self-driving vehicle. Why? To evaluate how passers-by, other drivers on the road and cyclists reacted to sharing the road with an autonomous vehicle.
The trial, conducted with the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, also made use of a light bar mounted on the top of the windshield to provide communication about what the car was doing, including yielding, driving autonomously or accelerating from a full stop.

So why engage in such elaborate dress-up, especially when it’s not even Halloween? Mainly because you actually still do need to have someone behind the wheel in real-world testing, and also because for the purposes of this experiment, Ford and VTTI didn’t actually need a self-driving car – they just needed people to believe wholeheartedly they were using one.
The Transit Connect van used for the trial would indicate its behavior using signals including a slow white pulse for yielding, a rapid blinking for accelerating from a stop, and staying solid if it’s actively in self-driving mode. The bar is positioned roughly where a driver’s eye line would be, to try to catch the attention of those around it who would look in its direction.

Ford’s chosen signals for the project are simple, but they’re intended to be, and they’re designed to not just replicate existing vehicle signalling apparatus, like break lights and turn signals, but to fill in gaps where we currently communicate via subtle gestures, eye contact and other less obvious mechanisms.
Ford and VTTI conducted VR testing to discover that these definitely need to be learned – people need a few different exposures before they clue in. But there’s potential for them to become widely accepted, provided they’re repeated often and consistently.
The test is just the start, though already Ford and VTTI have run 150 hours of tests covering around 1,800 miles in their urban testing ground, with a dense concentration of pedestrians, other drivers and cyclists. The eventual goal is to continue with light signal research, and then to work together with industry standards organizations including the International Organization for Standardization and SAE International to make these shared in common across automotive and transportation companies.
There’s a lot of work ahead – I hope that seat costume is comfortable, since previous similar examples suggest wearable upholstery isn’t.

78,Department of Transportation releases new self-driving vehicle guidelines,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/department-of-transportation-release-new-self-driving-vehicle-guidelines/,2017/09/12,"
Today, U.S. Depart of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao released the DoT and National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration’s new guidelines for automated driving systems. This is version 2.0 of a federal policy on self-driving cars, and Chao said it’s a “living document,” with plans already for version 3.0 to arrive in 2018.
These guidelines are called “A Vision for Safety 2.0,” which Chao says reflects their importance in terms of addressing the rising rate of traffic deaths in the U.S. Chao cited the most recent stats, which include the stat that 94 percent of serious motor vehicle accidents in the U.S. are due to human error, in presenting the new guidelines at an event today.
The new guidelines are designed to unify development of automation features, including full autonomy and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and to help unify industry, local, state and federal government efforts to that end. It’s voluntary guidance, but it focuses on SAE Levels 3 through 5 automation, and it clarifies that companies don’t need to wait to begin testing and deploying their automated driving systems, and streamlines the self-assessment process for companies and organizations.
Basically, it sounds like industry got a lot of what it was asking for here, with streamlined processes and fewer barriers to get testing.
“Creativity and innovation are part of the great genius of our country, America,” Chao said. “It is one of America’s hallmarks, and it is envied throughout the world.” She added that it’s the responsibility of policy makers in the U.S. to safeguard this reputation.
“Our goal[…] is to help usher in this new era of transportation, innovation and safety, ensuring that our country remains a global leader in autonomous vehicle technology,” Chao added.
The full document is below. We’ll have follow-up analysis coverage once we’ve been able to review the new guidelines in more detail:

79,NTSB says fatal Tesla Autopilot crash caused in part by resulting inattention,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/ntsb-says-fatal-tesla-autopilot-crash-caused-in-part-by-resulting-inattention/,2017/09/12,"
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) held a meeting today to discuss the results of its investigation into a 2016 crash in which a Tesla Model S with Autopilot engaged collided with a transport truck, resulting in the death of the Tesla’s driver Joshua Brown.
The NTSB report follows a finding earlier this year from NHTSA that found no evidence that Tesla’s Autopilot software didn’t work as intended. The NTSB similarly found that the system operated as intended – but also cited the driver’s inattentiveness, a result of his excess reliance on the Autopilot tech, was a cause in the death.
Per Recode, the agency’s probable accident cause reads in part:
Contributing to the car driver’s over-reliance on the vehicle automation was its operational design, which permitted his prolonged disengagement from the driving task and his use of the automation in ways inconsistent with guidance and warnings from the manufacturer.
NTSB’s members voted unanimously to attribute the probable cause of the accident to multiple factors, however, including also the failure of the truck driver to yield to the vehicle. But it said that while Tesla’s system was operating as technically designed, it was also not being used in the situations it was intended for, which means the driver wasn’t as engaged as they should be. In fact, the driver ignored at least seven warnings from the system to re-engage before the accident occured.
Tesla has altered the way its system operates since the accident, adding a feature that disengages the Autopilot system entirely if a driver is continually inattentive, and slowing the vehicle to a stop if warnings are repeatedly ignored. Autopilot also can’t be re-engaged at this point unless the vehicle comes to a complete stop and is re-started again. Autopilot improvements also included changes to how it operates on a sensor and automation level to prevent this kind of mishap in the future.
The board’s recommendations essentially suggest that systems like Autopilot simply cease to work when used outside of their intended operation conditions (which the new repeated warning shut-down addresses, at least in part). This recommendation is made to all manufacturers who offer automated vehicle controls, including Audi, Volvo, Infinity, Mercedes, BMW and Tesla.
A Tesla spokesperson provided the following statement regarding the NTSB’s findings to TechCrunch:
At Tesla, the safety of our customers comes first, and one thing is very clear: Autopilot significantly increases safety, as NHTSA has found that it reduces accident rates by 40%. We appreciate the NTSB’s analysis of last year’s tragic accident and we will evaluate their recommendations as we continue to evolve our technology. We will also continue to be extremely clear with current and potential customers that Autopilot is not a fully self-driving technology and drivers need to remain attentive at all times.

80,Honda will offer electrified option of all new vehicle models in Europe,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/honda-will-offered-electrified-option-of-all-new-vehicle-models-in-europe/,2017/09/12,"
Honda will offer an electrified version of all of its new models launched in Europe from now on, the company announced at this year’s Frankfurt Motor Show. Honda CEO Takahiro Hachigo revealed the news on stage at Honda’s conference event at the auto show, and noted that while Honda wants to have electrified vehicle options account for two-thirds of all its new cars sales by 2030, it’s targeting 2025 for that same split in Europe because of stronger interest in that region.
Honda offering hybrid and fully electric cars on all new models going forward and Europe should help in terms of providing consumer choice. The Honda CR-V Hybrid, a prototype for which was introduced at the show, will be Honda’s first hybrid SUV on sale in Europe starting in 2018. Honda intends to add even more EV options throughout its lineup to come, including the Urban EV concept it also debuted at Frankfurt.
As part of its electric strategy it’s also introducing a new energy transfer system called the power Manager Concept that can reverse the flow of energy from a vehicle battery to the home to reduce dependence on the grid, and even sell power back to energy companies when it makes sense to do so. These will begin being installed in France first, during a pilot in the western part of the country with a target completion date of 2020.
Many automakers are going all-in on electrification plans, with announcements regarding target dates for when all vehicles in their lineup will have electric options. Honda hasn’t revealed a global target date for that yet, but this European announcement indicates it’s already planning in that direction.

81,Audi’s Aicon concept ditches pedals and wheel in favor of full autonomy,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/audis-aicon-concept-ditches-pedals-and-wheel-in-favor-of-full-autonomy/,2017/09/12,"
Audi’s looking ahead to the what its vehicles will look like once true self-driving technology is available and on the roads with the Aicon, a new concept vehicle it’s debuting at the Frankfurt Motor Show in Germany. The Aicon ditches the steering wheel and pedals in favor of a design aimed at luxury and comfort, with a four-door, 2 by 2 seating design that can be quickly changed up depending on how many people are riding and whether they want to stretch out.
The purely electric Aicon also has an ambitious range from its big battery – nearly 500 miles on one charge, which would make it one hell of a robotic ride sharing car.

What might be most interesting about the Audi Aicon is how much it still looks like an aggressively-styled performance automobile, rather than something you’d create just to optimize for use of interior space or transportation practicality. It has 26-inch wheels, housed with flared fenders, and a long, low body that conveys a sense of forward motion.
Clearly, Audi thinks performance will still be important to those using cars even when they’re no longer driving them. The user experience will also be key, of course, and Audi has some interesting innovations there with the Aicon, too, including a companion drone that comes with the car, and a built-in “empathetic electronic vehicle assistant.”
That assistant, called “PIA,” can recognize riders by their phone and then tweak vehicle settings to their custom specifications, including things like cabin comforts, lighting and seating position. It also responds to voice commands for things like navigation destination and entertainment.

The included drone has a built-in flashlight and is called a “light companion,” designed primarily for lighting a user’s path as they enter and exit the vehicle at night. The car does away with long-range headlights for nighttime driving, relying instead on its autonomous sensor suite to navigate dark driving conditions.
For conveying its presence to others, however, it has projector modules that can display signs on the ground around. For those inside, it can display media either on its interior screens, or even on the windshield as a heads-up viewing area for movies or whatever you’re working on.
This concept is maybe one of the more fully fleshed out visions of what a truly autonomous long-range car would look like in practice. It’s still obviously quite a ways off from actually becoming a reality, but this is definitely the direction automakers are thinking.

BMW has a new electric concept vehicle designed to show how it envisions occupying its electric model range between the i3 and the i8: The i Visions Dynamics. The four-dour luxury coupe has a head-turning design, including Tesla-familiar features like flush door handles, but BMW is also touting its range at a whopping 373 miles, with a top speed of over 120 mph and a 0-to-60 mph time of just four seconds.
The concept is part of BMW’s overall electrification plan, which sees the automaker fielding 25 electrified models by 2025, with 12 of those being purely electric vehicles. The i Vision Dynamics represents a look at what some of those cars can look like.

It has a fully glass roof without any cross-supports, and a focus on interior comfort and passenger experience. That’s partially designed to help support semi and fully autonomous driving down the road, BMW says.
That front grill is inspired by the current look for BMW automobiles, but houses sensors and an “intelligent surface” rather than being intended for engine cooling. There’s a lit model name display on the back of the vehicle, and unique LED headlights that emphasize the sporty design.

If the stats remain consistent between this concept and whatever production vehicle gets made in terms of a four-door from BWM in its electric performance lineup, this could be a real Tesla Model S competitor, offering similar performance and potentially much better range, though the figures given today are far from EPA standard tallies.
If this is what the future of BMW’s electric i lineup looks like, count me in. Of course, a lot can change between concept and production, but this looks to be on the right track.

This new concept from Honda, the Urban EV, looks like something most automakers would show off as a distant vision of what cars might look like in five or ten years’ time. Honda, however, says it’s targeting a launch of the vehicle in European markets by 2019 – just two years from now.
The EV Concept has a look seemingly inspired by hatchbacks from the 70s or 80s, including some of Honda’s own early Civic models. The car is far from retro in other regards, however, including the displays front and back of the vehicle which show charging percentage and rates, as well as brand badging and other information, like greetings, “advice for other drivers on the roads” and more.

Honda’s EV Concept also has an expansive touchscreen display which spans nearly the entire interior dashboard, offering a view Honda describes as “panoramic.” The screen even extends into the doors, and those display feeds from the car’s two wing mirror cameras for checking the space around the vehicle.

It’s a compact in terms of exterior dimensions, and a two-door, but there are four seats within, both bench style. The vehicle is designed for maximum interior spaces given its small stature, however.
Onboard intelligence is provided via Honda’s Automated Network Assistant, which is designed to learn about a driver over time and then adapt that information in order to help provide info like routing recommendations or other tips intended to be customized to a driver’s personal preferences.
This is a very cool car, and one that I’d love to see offered beyond European borders. Honda’s also basing it on an entirely new, electric-specific platform, which is intended to help guide their EV strategy going forward.

Autonomous vehicle startup Zoox is in talks with Japanese investment firm SoftBank to raise more funding. We’ve confirmed the news, which was first reported by Axios. 
We’re hearing the discussions are in the early stages and nothing has been finalized, but that SoftBank has been interested in Zoox for a while. The startup is also talking to other unnamed potential investors.
Zoox presently has a valuation above $1.5 billion and previously raised capital from Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Lux Capital and others. Axios is reporting that the SoftBank conversations have been in the $3 billion to $4 billion valuation range.
Building vehicles is a capital-intensive business, so it’s no surprise that Zoox would seek more funding. And SoftBank’s Vision Fund has about $100 billion to invest, so the team is looking for opportunities to write big checks.
Zoox has been quietly building self-driving cars, sharing little detail about its plans. We’re hearing that the group has explored creating an Uber-like on-demand service.
The race to build self-driving cars has been heating up. Uber and Alphabet’s Waymo are amongst the many companies that have been building prototypes.
Zoox was founded in 2014 by Jesse Levinson, who came from Stanford’s self-driving car group, and Tim Kentley-Klay, an entrepreneur from Australia. The Menlo Park-based startup has been hiring employees from companies like Tesla, Alphabet and Apple.
We’ve reached out to Zoox for comment.

86,Volkswagen to offer electric versions of all of its vehicles by 2030,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/volkswagen-to-offer-electric-versions-of-all-of-its-vehicles-by-2030/,2017/09/11,"
Volkswagen is the latest car maker to announce a move to electrify its entire range of automobile offerings: The car maker will provide either hybrid or electric versions of every one of its 300 models by 2030, it announced today ahead of the Frankfurt Motor Show in German.
VW’s not the first to make a similar commitment — and in fact Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz announced it was going to do the same by 2022 earlier today. But the Volkswagen Group’s vehicle range is quite a bit larger than Mercedes-Benz’s, which makes this a more significant overall commitment.
By 2025, Volkswagen plans to offer 80 new electric vehicles across its group and sub-brands, which include Audi, Bentley, Bugatti and the Volkswagen brand itself. VW has committed to spend nearly $23 billion U.S. on getting this plan in place via zero emissions technology investment, and it also said it would commit more than $55 billion toward purchasing batteries to provide power for these vehicles.
The news also follows the big announcement from this weekend that China would be banning fossil fuel burning vehicles eventually, joining commitments made by the U.K. and France before. There’s clearly a trend on both the regulatory and the industry side of the equation with regards to electrified vehicles, but there will still be a lot of questions and work to be done in terms of maturing the supply chain and overcoming technology and infrastructure challenges.

87,GM and Cruise announce first mass-production self-driving car,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/gm-and-cruise-announce-first-mass-production-self-driving-car/,2017/09/11,"
Kyle Vogt, CEO and founder of Cruise Automation, revealed very big news for his company and its owner GM, which acquired the startup last year. The news is that they’re ready to mass produce a vehicle ready for self-driving, with everything on board they need to become fully autonomous vehicles once the software and regulatory environment is ready to make that happen.
“Today, we’re announcing the first production design of a self-driving car that can be built at massive scale,” Vogt said. “And more importantly, these vehicles can operate without a driver.”
That means they have all the components in place, that “when the software’s ready,” Vogt added, they can remove the drivers and operate safely on roads.
Doug Parks, GM’s VP of Autonomous Technology and Vehicle Execution, explained that he has been involved in the design of Volt, and Bolt EV. Throughout, they knew this could be a platform that eventually led toward autonomous capabilities. All were “on the way to enabling what Kyle just announced, the first mass-produced, autonomous high-volume car.”
“It’s making the changes to the design so that we can build that on the line at Orion’s assembly center,” Parks explained, talking about how this includes working with suppliers to get parts ready and that was what was accomplished with its generation-two test cars.
This latest vehicle is a production-ready design, Parks said. What that means is that it has “full redundancy” throughout the autonomous system, so that it’s ready mechanically and from a sensor and software perspective to “fail operationally and be safe.”
The vehicle will be based on a third-generation Cruise self-driving platform, using the Chevrolet Bolt, and will be produced at the automaker’s Orion, Michigan facility, which is where they previously announced they would be producing their Bolt test cars.
This isn’t an announcement that means self-driving cars will be available on roads to consumers tomorrow; Park said there’s still “a lot of work to be done” before that can happen.
Vogt talked about how their goal throughout has been to increase safety with autonomous tech, and pointed out that there’s no way that can happen without scale: Launching a few hundred cars on the roads isn’t going to accomplish that larger benefit.
“The key challenge, and what’s hard especially for tech companies, is building the cars,” he said. “And building lots of them.”
Retrofit vehicles are hard to build, he said, and they “keep breaking,” so it’s hard to continually fix them up and get them back on the roads. This announcement means that the cars will be able to roll off the line in quantities of hundreds of thousands per year. And while they look very much like the current shipping Bolt EV, under the hood, Vogt said that 40 percent of the parts are new, and most of those are focused on redundancy of parts and systems.
Fifty vehicles have been built by GM, and production is expected to ramp up from here. Vogt says there isn’t yet a timeline for deploying the software that enables full self-driving, but he added that these are destined for deployment in fleets, rather than as individually owned consumer vehicles.
As for deployment of these new cars that have actually been produced, Vogt says that they’ll start to be integrated into the “Cruise Anywhere” on-demand ride-hailing service offered to Cruise employees in San Francisco in the coming weeks.
Vogt pointed out that this is the third generation of Cruise’s autonomous vehicle in just 14 months, which is indeed a remarkable timeline for development of a fully functional self-driving platform, even for testing purposes. He also took the opportunity to highlight the difference between what GM and Cruise have announced, and the kind of one-off demonstration vehicles other automakers and tech companies have brought to events like CES.

Mercedes-Benz is the latest automaker to embrace electrification, announcing that it will be electrifying its entire vehicle lineup by 2022. Get used to it: Car makers are going to be making these announcements at an increasing clip, especially now that China, the most important car market in the world right now, has announced plans to eventually move to ban the sale of fossil fuel vehicles entirely.
Here’s the deal: Mercedes-Benz chief Dieter Zetsche said that the car maker will offer either hybrid or fully electric versions of its vehicles by 2022, adding up to a total of a minimum of 50 new electric model options by that time. Smart, meanwhile, another Daimler-owned sub-brand, will go fully electric by 2020.
This puts Mercedes-Benz in good company with other higher-end car manufacturers, including Volvo, which have committed to offering a fully electrified lineup by 2019, and Ford’s Lincoln luxury sub-brand has also set 2022 as the deadline for offering electric variants of each of its vehicle models.
As mentioned, China announced over the weekend that it would eventually ban the sale of all fossil fuel-powered cars in the country, within a timeline to be determined. China’s vehicle sales numbers have led the world recently, and are increasing at an impressive clip annually, so automakers reconfiguring their long-term strategy to focus on EVs in light of China’s favoring of EV tech makes plenty of sense. France and the U.K. have also expressed plans to phase out fossil fuel cars by 2040.

Tesla is ramping up its deployment of Supercharger stations across the U.S. and internationally as part of its commitment to addressing growing demand, especially in light of the Model 3 beginning production. Now, it’s moving to get Superchargers in more populated city centers, in addition to highway and travel destination spots outside of metropolitan areas.
Tesla revealed today that its work to bring the Supercharger network to city centers starts with locations in downtown Chicago and Boston that open Monday, and that these new Supercharger stations for urban areas have a new design that includes rapid charging with a dedicated 72 kW of power per vehicle — so that with multiple cars at the same station, there’s no downgrade in charging rates.
That should allow a full charge within 45 to 50 minutes on average, Tesla says. The new Supercharger stations also have new physical designs that allow them to take up less space, which is obviously better for tight-packed parking spots common for cities.
The new locations include 10 stalls in Chicago at 225 North Columbus Drive, and 8 stalls at 800 Boylston Street in Boston. The spots are updated in Tesla’s routing software, too, so you can find exactly where they are at these new addresses, and they’re open 24 hours a day, just like Tesla’s existing network.

Uber’s Advanced Technology Group has hired Jon Thomason, who most recently acted as Head of Mobile and Product at Facebook’s Oculus virtual reality company. Thomason will lead ATG software teams across Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto, working on ATG’s advanced software projects, including autonomous driving and trucking.
Thomason joined Oculus in 2016 as Head of Software, and assumed responsibility for its mobile VR products in December when Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe moved to a role overseeing PC-based VR and leaving the CEO position. Prior to that, Thomason was VP of Mobile Shopping at Amazon, and VP of Engineering at Qualcomm before that.
His experience has covered a range of different types of software applications, and he worked on Qualcomm’s application processor software team, focusing on the chipmaker’s capabilities around mobile graphics, camera and OS support. Thomason also oversaw Microsoft’s launch system software for its Xbox gaming console and Xbox Live online gaming service during his decade and a half at the Windows-maker. He also lead the kernel development process for Windows 95 while at Microsoft.
“We are very excited to welcome Jon to Uber ATG,” wrote Uber Head of ATG Eric Meyofer in a statement to TechCrunch. “His background in software engineering and his experience in launching innovative new products makes him a great fit for our team and we look forward to seeing him in action.”
Thomason’s wide range of experience should provide a broad base from which to help guide Uber ATG’s software development plans. The company’s software projects include deep learning, computer vision, safety systems, security, autonomy, mapping and more. A flexible generalist like Thomason with lots of history working on software at the very base level is a great choice to lead such a complex and multifaceted product development effort.
Currently, Uber’s ATG team has more than 200 people working on software alone, according to the company. Thomason’s first day on the job is today, September 11.

A new Far Infrared (FIR) sensor from Israeli company AdaSky could help bring vehicles with Level 3, 4 and 5 autonomy features to market faster. The solution is the first to offer an FIR camera with built-in machine learning software for processing the results, in a solid-state form factor with no moving parts, at a cost that AdaSky says is “suited for mass market” use.
AdaSky’s solution is called “Viper,” and it works by passively collecting FIR signals sent out as heat by warm objects, including other cars and humans. Its range means that it can pick up signals from as many as a few hundred meters away, allowing it to detect pedestrians earlier than other sensors, and work in concert with different tech including LiDAR and traditional cameras to verify that pedestrians are in fact pedestrians ahead of time.

The high resolution thermal camera works both at a distance of a few hundred meters and up close, and it also helps fill in gaps in perception left by other solutions including vision cameras, radar and LiDAR – and even sensor fusion results from a combination of all three. Viper has advantages in changing lighting and weather conditions, for instance, where other sensors encounter problems, and it can add another dimension of signal from which to derive classifications of objects – offering more confidence that a pedestrian is a pedestrian, for instance, or that a person on a bike is a person on a bike.
AdaSky’s Viper prototype has been heading out to tier-one auto industry suppliers and automakers quietly for a few months now, and the company hopes to move towards mass production and commercialization next.

Dara Khosrowshahi, the recently named CEO of Uber, is leaving the New York Times Company’s board of directors.
According to a government filing, Khosrowshahi notified the NYT board on Thursday that he would be resigning from the role because of his new responsibilities at Uber. The former Expedia CEO had been on the board since 2015.
“Mr. Khosrowshahi’s decision to resign as a director was not due to any disagreements with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices,” said the filing. Khosrowshahi had served on the audit committee as well as the technology and innovation committee.
He wasn’t the only tech vet on the board. Brian McAndrews, former CEO of Pandora, and Rebecca Van Dyck, CMO of Facebook’s Oculus, both have seats. 
The New York Times was recently criticized for not initially disclosing that Khosrowshahi was on its board when it wrote about him becoming the new Uber CEO. The media publication said it regretted the error, but that Khosrowshahi’s board seat had no impact on its Uber coverage.
The company’s stock is up 53% in the past year.

93,China plans to ban sales of fossil fuel cars entirely,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/10/china-plans-to-ban-sales-of-fossil-fuel-cars-entirely/,2017/09/10,"
China’s big electric vehicle push is about to get even bigger: The country is planning to end the sale of fossil fuel-powered vehicles entirely, with regulators working currently on a timetable of when the ban will ultimately take effect, according to Bloomberg.
China is the world’s largest auto market, with 28.03 million vehicles sold last year, a boost in demand of 13.7 percent vs. 2015 sales numbers. The nation has already done a lot to incentivize manufacturers to develop and sell new EVs, including allowing foreign automakers to create a third joint venture with local automakers (a standard requirement for doing business in the country for auto OEMs) so long as it’s dedicated to the creation of EVs exclusively.
The government has also created a number of incentive programs for OEMs, including subsidies. This will add to its positive efforts to drive more EV sales in China with the ultimate negative condition on the other side – at some point, automakers just won’t be able to do business at all in the country if they’re still selling a mix of fossil fuel and electrified vehicles.
This isn’t the first time a governing body has said it would eventually phase out the sale of traditional fuel vehicles: France said it will stop selling fossil fuel cars by 2040 in July, and the UK has committed to the same timeline for sales of those vehicles.
Critics have suggested that a ban on fossil fuel vehicles is likely impractical, because it would stretch an already taxed supply chain, which has some hard limits in terms of the volume of lithium available for lithium-ion battery cells, for instance. But automakers are already responding to this rising trend with expanded EV model lineups and, in the case of Volvo for instance, plans to eventually sell exclusively all-electric or hybrid cars.
China’s timeline for establishing this ban will be crucial in terms of how quickly we see the global shift to EVs occur, as it’s going to be an immense lever in terms of automaker strategic planning internationally, as well as in the country.

94,Volvo acquires car valet startup Luxe to boost its digital services business,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/08/volvo-acquires-car-valet-startup-luxe-to-boost-its-digital-services-business/,2017/09/08,"
After a pivot and months of speculation about the future of car valet and concierge startup Luxe, the company has finally found a home. Today, automaker Volvo Cars announced that it is acquiring the startup’s platform, technology, key staff and other assets, which it will use to put some fuel into its own digital services strategy.
The terms of the acquisition are not being disclosed, but we are trying to find out. The startup, according to Pitchbook, had previously been valued around at least $140 million post-money in its last round of funding, which came from Hertz in 2016 (on a $110 million pre-money valuation, according to our report). One source close to the deal tells us that the terms here were closely guarded, and that the assumption at this point is that it was ‘pennies on the dollar’ based on the last valuation.
Luxe’s service had allowed drivers to drop off their car at any point in a city where services are offered, whereupon a professional valet would find a parking spot for the vehicle, and refuel and clean the car if requested.
As part of the acquisition, Luxe’s CEO and co-founder Curtis Lee is becoming VP of digital for Volvo Cars. “The entire team is coming over including Craig (Martin, co-founder of Luxe),” Lee wrote in an email to TechCrunch. “Craig will be continue to lead our engineering team.”
The move comes at a time when automakers around the world are investing into and buying assets of car-focused tech startups to help propel them into the next generation of car ownership, and cars themselves. Other developments have included sizeable investments in transportation-on-demand startups, acquisitions of self-driving technology and consortiums of car makers cobbling together to buy large mapping and navigation providers.
Volvo — originally a Swedish car maker, before getting acquired by Ford in 1999, and then subsequently by Geely Holding in 2010 — itself has also been a notable player in this evolution: the company in July announced that all of its cars will either electric or hybrid by 2019. A month later, in August, the first rumors began to surface noting that Volvo was interested in buying Luxe.
Volvo already has an operation in Silicon Valley, and Luxe’s team will join that group, the company said.

“Our vision is a future in which technology simplifies life so you never have to stop at a petrol station, go to a car wash or even take your car in for service ever again. The acquisition of Luxe is a step towards realising that ambition. I look forward to working closely with the highly talented team at Luxe who created its advanced technology from the ground up,” said Atif Rafiq, Chief Digital Officer at Volvo Cars, in a statement.
Volvo’s vehicles address various segments in the car-making business — from delivery trucks through to high-end luxury vehicles, and this acquisition sounds like it’s firmly to help develop services for the latter. It plans to offer pick-up and drop-off services; and it will be using the tech for other services, too. “The technology behind Luxe provides the company with advanced algorithms in the areas of routing, logistics planning and arrival time prediction,” the company said.
“As more and more of our cars are connected, the availability of digital services becomes a critical part of the process of selecting a new car. Simplification of experience and placing control directly into the hands of the consumer is what today’s technologies enable, and what defines our vision in the digital space,” said Mr Rafiq.
For Luxe, this is a final destination after months of question marks about the four-year-old company, which is operational across some (but not all) major cities in the U.S., including San Francisco, New York and Chicago. The company had raised over $75 million in funding, with backers including Hertz, GV and Foundation Capital, as well as a lot of individual investors.
But in a world flush with on-demand services, it seems that it wasn’t able to get the right mix of services to the right people to make a fully successful run of its business. The company closed its door-to-door valet service earlier this year as it planned a pivot, and shortly after that we and others heard that Uber was knocking on their door. That deal clearly never closed, and Volvo moved in instead.
In an essay about the acquisition, Luxe’s Lee notes that Volvo approached Luxe several months ago.
“Working at Volvo gives us scale, resources and access to a global company that is committed to the future. Moreover, Volvo is committed to allowing us to fulfil our vision,” he notes. “With the acquisition, Luxe will continue to operate as its own unit working on some of Volvo’s most meaningful initiatives in mobility and digital customer experiences. I look forward to continuing to lead the Luxe team at Volvo.”
Volvo last year sold 534,332 cars, up 6.2 percent on 2015.

95,"Uber plans to electrify uberX in London by 2019, entire city fleet by 2025",https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/08/uber-plans-to-electrify-uberx-in-london-by-2019-entire-city-fleet-by-2025/,2017/09/08,"
Uber is looking to get in line with London’s forthcoming transport rules regarding the use of zero emissions vehicles for private hire car service in the city. London has set an aggressive target of requiring that all new London private hire vehicles be zero emission cars by 2020, and the city hopes to be entirely emission-free by 2050.
Uber has plans to electrify its entire London vehicle fleet by 2025, and to make sure that all cars on its uberX offering are either fully electric or hybrid vehicles by 2019. That’s an ambitious goal, especially given that Uber can’t just replace its own fleet of cars – since it doesn’t own one. Instead, it has to incentivize the switch for drivers.
Partly, the incentive will be actually being able to operate in London once the new rules go through. But Uber is also announcing a new funding arrangement for anyone looking to upgrade to a hybrid or electric vehicle, which could range up to as much as £5,000 ($6,604 US) depending on conditions met. Uber’s also handing out up to £1,5000 ($1,981 US) in Uber credit for London residents who ditch their old diesel car.
All told, Uber is committing as much as £150 million (nearly $200 million US) on its fund over time – but it’s not solely generating the funds from existing sources: It’s adding a £0.35 ($0.45 US) fee on the rider to rides in the city to help pay for the transition. Teamwork makes the dream work.

Ford’s Lincoln luxury brand is looking to field electrified powertrain options for all of its vehicles by 2022, according to a new Reuters report. That’s the third major piece of news today about an automaker either going all-electric or expanding their electric lineup significantly, for those keeping count.
Ford’s electric plans for Lincoln could be fully revealed as soon as next month, per the report, and could help the company with its plans in China, which is gradually introducing rules for auto sales in the country designed to encourage the update of EVs.
Lincoln’s electrification strategy apparently focuses on hybrid vehicles specifically, with the aim of contributing to Ford’s overall program of fielding nearly 20 new electrified vehicles by around 2022. Lincoln’s competitors are also making significant bets on electric, including Volvo, which has committed to offering electric and hybrid-only drivetrain options on all new vehicles by 2019.
Plug-in hybrids of existing and new models should start to roll out beginning with new MKC and Aviator crossovers, set for introduction in 2019, per the report, with a hybrid Navigator also set to make a debut that year.

98,Jaguar’s new concept has a steering wheel you talk to and take with you,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/jaguars-new-concept-has-a-steering-wheel-you-talk-to-and-take-with-you/,2017/09/07,"
Jaguar is envisioning a future that’s focused on self-driving and on-demand shared mobility with its new Future-Type concept car. The vehicle boasts fully autonomous or assisted manual driving options, a narrow body design aimed at fitting into tight quarters in dense cities – and a removable steering wheel named ‘Sayer’ that’s sort of like an automotive Pokémon pal.
The Future-Type’s Sayer steering wheel is removable, and is designed to go with the driver wherever they go. It’s a music player, a smart assistant, a mobile device and, well, a steering wheel all in one. You can talk to Sayer using voice commands, asking it to set appointments, summon your vehicle, control your smart home and more.

Meanwhile, the Future-Type itself will be able to work with co-operative car sharing networks, allowing others to summon it and take it for trips, providing its owner opts in to that kind of sharing. Sayer of course will manage its deployment based on your availability and plans. Plus, if you ever want to take over and actually drive (something Jaguar owners are likely big on) then the wheel can be used to steer the vehicle, too.

Weirdly, in this vision of the automotive future, the only aspect of the car you might actually fully own is the steering wheel itself – Jaguar envisions this being the primary link between customers and shared transportation services, so that Sayer works interchangeably with a network of linked, distributed use Future-Type cars.
As with any concept, this is just one vision of what the future may hold – and a far out one at that. Let me just say, though, that a virtual buddy built into a modular, go-anywhere steering wheel/mobile device sounds like a great setup for a sci-fi novella.

99,BMW to offer 12 fully electric car models by 2025,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/bmw-to-offer-12-fully-electric-car-models-by-2025/,2017/09/07,"
BMW says that it’ll have a total of 25 electrified vehicles in its lineup by 2025, with a full dozen of those being full-electric cars. These should have a usable range of up to 435 miles, BMW CEO Harald Krueger told reporters, according to Reuters.
That’s another brick in the wall for the ongoing automotive market powertrain switch, which gained steam today with another announcement from Jaguar Land Rover, which committed to making sure its entire lineup of vehicles has an electrified option by 2020.
The BMW move will include making sure it has the ability to mass produce its electric vehicles and drivetrains in sufficient quantities to cover the range and demand: All of its cars should also be able to offer electrified powertrain options, whether fully electric or hybrid, by the 2020 mark.
BMW is planning to show off a new zero-emission all-electric four-dour vehicle at the Frankfurt auto show next week, which will sit between the current i3 and i8 offerings in its EV lineup.

100,Jaguar’s E-type Zero is a true classic with a future-proof electric powertrain,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/jaguars-e-type-zero-is-a-true-classic-with-a-future-proof-electric-powertrain/,2017/09/07,"
Jaguar has a new electric vehicle – but it’s also a very old one. The new Jaguar E-type Zero pairs a car once described by Enzo Ferrari as “the most beautiful” in the world now has a zero emission drivetrain, created by Jaguar Land Rover Classic Works in Coventry, England.
The rebuilt E-type looks the same as the original, but it actually beats its performance with a 0-60mph time of under 5.5 seconds, which is around 1 second better than the gas-powered classic Series 1 version. The other big difference? LED headlights replace the incandescents, as a way of getting more bang for your buck when it comes to that electric power source.

The powertrain can put out 220kW and is tailor-made for the E-type, with a lithium-ion battery pack that has nearly the same physical dimensions as the six-cylinder engine that gave the original car its get-up-and-go. This has another benefit: the original engine can be swapped in with relative ease at any time, should you feel even more nostalgic for the E-type’s racing heyday.

Driving in real-world conditions, the car can actually manage around 170 miles of range – better than the new Nissan Leaf – and can charge up to full overnight.
It might just be the coolest electric car ever made, but don’t start hoarding your cash just yet, as there are no firm plans to release it. Still, Jaguar Land Rover says it’s going to “investigate bringing this concept to market,” so there is reason to hope.

Jaguar Land Rover is joining the rising chorus of automakers embracing electric and fusion powertrain options, revealing that all new vehicles in both the Jaguar and Land Rover range will offer an electric or hybrid option from 2020 on. Jaguar Land Rover announced the news on Thursday at its very first Tech Fest event, noting that this will include fully electric, plug-in hybrid and mild hybrid vehicles.
While it’s not quite as extreme as committing to produce only electric or hybrid vehicles, as have both Volvo and Aston Martin, it’s still a significant step towards promoting alternative drivetrain technologies.
Jaguar Land Rover’s decision to introduce a full range of electrified options represents an aggressive quickening of pace for the car makers drivetrain change-up plans; the Jaguar I-PACE, the company’s first fully electric model is set to enter the market next year.
The tide is clearly turning in favor of electrified drivetrains in the automotive industry, and now the major questions remaining are around how infrastructure and consumers will deal with this coming transition.

103,"LiDAR maker Innoviz raises $65M from Delphi, Magna and more",https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/lidar-maker-innoviz-raises-65m-from-delphi-magna-and-more/,2017/09/07,"
Innoviz, a company making LiDAR sensors to support the development and deployment of autonomous driving, has raised a new $65 million in Series B funding, from strategic partners and leading auto industry suppliers Delphi Automotive and Magna International, along with other investors. The vote of confidence from Magna and Delphi is especially noteworthy, however, because both stand ready to supply automakers with core autonomous driving components and systems as top-tier suppliers.
The new funding will help Innoviz continue to push towards mass production of their LiDAR solution, which uses a solid-state design for greater reliability over time (thanks to a lack of moving parts) and which also claims better sensing capabilities across different weather conditions, including in typically challenging conditions for LiDAR like bright sunlight.
Innoviz previously announced that it would be offering InnovizPro, a development-focused version of its tech, in 2018, and it says it’s on track to begin delivering those to automakers starting in the first quarter of next year. InnovizOne, the company’s automotive-grade LiDAR sensor designed for production vehicles, is still set to be available sometime in 2019 in a manufacturing sample capacity.

The company’s strategic partners in this round are already working with Innoviz through partnerships to bring autonomy to automotive OEMs, and to create integrations with self-driving systems targeted at the mass market. With this funding, it can continue to work towards mass production of its new LiDAR modules, while also building out its computer vision work and making new partnerships, the company says.
Innoviz expects a second closing of the round with new partners and funding to follow, too. With the amount of interest in self-driving vehicles, and the need to secure reliable, cost-effective LiDAR sensors to fuel their roll out, it’s not surprising the company is garnering a lot of attention and investment.

The U.S. House approved a bill called the SELF-DRIVE act, which was put together by both Democrats and Republicans – a rarity in today’s congressional goings-on. If it becomes law (which still requires it to pass the Senate), then it would make it possible for companies working on self-driving to field a lot more vehicles per year – as many as 100,000 autonomous test cars annually, in fact.
Basically, the proposed bill would make it possible for companies including Ford, Waymo, GM’s Cruise and others to bypass some safety standards that currently apply to human piloted cars, including requirements like that they have steering wheels and gas pedals on board. This legislation would also supersede state-by-state rules, making it possible for autonomous testing to proceed on a level playing field across the U.S.
The Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, which is an industry group including Ford, Lyft, Uber, Volvo Group and Waymo, provided the following statement from general counsel David Strickland to TechCrunch:

Self-driving vehicles offer an opportunity to significantly increase safety, improve transportation access for underserved communities, and transform how people, goods and services get from point A to B.
The Coalition is grateful for the House Committee on Energy and Commerce’s bipartisan leadership on the SELF DRIVE Act, and we look forward to working with members of the House and Senate to enact autonomous vehicle legislation that enhances safety, creates new mobility opportunities, and facilitates innovation.

The Senate has also been working on its own self-driving bill, and plans to hold a hearing in September to debate whether it will cover trucking as well.

Peugeot automaker PSA Group will work with AImotive, a startup focused on developing autonomous vehicle tech, for a test of Level 4 AI-based autonomy on highways in France, the companies announced on Wednesday. The pilot projects will involve self-driving at speeds ranging up to 80 mph, and will use AImotive sensor and compute hardware, and autonomous software, installed on a Citroen C4 Picasso test car.
AImotive, a Hungary-based self-driving startup, offers “full stack” AI-based autonomous driving software, and recently expanded to the U.S. with a new Mountain View office. The company’s goal is to produce a scalable self-driving solution that automakers can adopt regardless of their particular hardware stack and vehicle designs.

The partnership with PSA began in May, and has included testing on a Hungary-based proving ground. There’s no definite timeline on when real-world trials on French roads will begin, or how many vehicles will take part in that process as of yet.
AImotive isn’t PSA Group’s sole partner in self-driving: the automaker also teamed up with Boston-based nuTonomy earlier this year, with a plan to begin trialling that startup’s self-driving tech in a modified Peugeot 3008 on public roads in Singapore, which was set to kick off this month.

107,Turo raises $92M and acquires Daimler’s Croove car-sharing business,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/turo-raises-92m-and-acquires-daimlers-croove-car-sharing-business/,2017/09/06,"
Turo has a new strategic partner in automaker Daimler, with ties solidified through both an investment by Daimler in the car-sharing startup and through the acquisition by Turo of Croove, Daimler’s own Turo-like subsidiary.
The funding is part of a new $92 million Series D round raised by Turo, which was also led by South Korean giant SK Holdings, in addition to Daimler, and which includes participation from new investors Liberty Mutual Strategic Ventures and Founders Circle Capital, as well as from existing partners.
This investment includes a lot of new strategic tie-ups for Turo, which allows individual vehicle owners and small rental fleet operators to offer their cars up for short-term rentals by others. Liberty Mutual is clearly a key asset thanks to its insurance industry perspective, and this deepens the relationship between the two companies, since Liberty already provides insurance for cars on Turo’s sharing platform.
SK Holdings has a number of sub-companies, including SK Telecom, with ties to the automotive industry, and they’ve also recently been investing heavily in new mobility brands. These include SoCar, as well as leading short-term car rental services in other Southeast Asian manufacturers like Malaysia. They represent a partner with potentially far-reaching impact for Turo.
“They have several SK companies that are involved closely with OEMs,” explained Turo CEO Andre Haddad in an interview. “They provide parts and systems for car manufacturers based in Korea, as well as global manufacturers of cars. Recently, they started investing in mobility services. They found that Turo, with our global perspective, and they’re keen on positioning themselves in what they believe is going to be a significant part of how people access, buy, sell and finance cars in the future.”
Haddad points out that the number of cars on the road is fastest growing in Asia, and he says SK also invested because  they believe they also can help with Turo’s Asia expansion plans in general.
Daimler’s investment is unique, since it also comes alongside Turo’s acquisition of its Croove business. Croove, which launched in December last year, was a car-sharing business that Daimler fully owned, which launched in Germany initially. It offered a very similar model to Turo, allowing anyone to rent their vehicle on a peer-to-peer basis, and it was open to vehicles of any make and model.
“We had a lot of interest from a bunch of OEMs in this round, and we had great conversations with a lot of those OEMs,” explained Haddad. “One of the things we particularly liked about Daimler was that they were not just talking the talk, they were walking the walk with their direct investment in incubating and launching Croove. We do believe that our platform Turo and peer-to-peer car sharing is fundamentally going to evolve car ownership and we believe that partnering with an OEM that has already expressed their deep interest and belief in this phenomenon by building their own business with Croove was a differentiator.”
Once the investment in Turo by Daimler was agreed upon, Haddad says it made no sense for the automaker to continue to operate its own separate peer-to-peer car sharing business, hence the decision to put Croove in Turo’s hands. As to why it went that way, when a lot of OEMs seem to be going in the other direction and acquiring younger mobility startups, Haddad says it’s about recognition on both sides of how the model works.
“For peer-to-peer car sharing to be really successful, it needs to be operated within an open platform where anyone can participate,” he said. “We believe very strongly that peer-to-peer marketplaces are only great when they are open and accessible. I think there was mutual recognition of this fundamental nature of peer-to-peer marketplaces, and I believe that’s the reason why Daimler are also very clear on this dynamic.”
Haddad said the details of how the transition will work in practice are still being worked out, but the plan is not to operate separate brands for long, and to launch Turo in Germany in place of the Croove brand in a matter of “weeks and months,” not years.

108,The new 2018 Nissan Leaf offers 150 miles of EV range,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/the-new-2018-nissan-leaf-offers-150-miles-of-ev-range/,2017/09/05,"
Nissan unveiled its new 2018 all-electric Leaf at a special event on Tuesday, and the much-anticipated successor to one of the earliest production EVs had some interesting tricks up its sleeve. Most of these focused on intelligent driver assistance features, including ProPILOT semi-autonomous driving and parking capabilities.
The Leaf also had an updated body design, with a more aerodynamic look aimed at helping to make the most of its onboard electric battery. That battery provides 150 miles of range under EPA estimates (400 km or 238 miles under the less conservative Japanese rating agency standards), which is better than the just-over 100 miles of the last generation, but below some of its key rivals at the entry-level including the Tesla Model 3 and the Chevrolet Bolt for range.
The battery can be charged in 16 hours using 3 kW charger, or 8 hours using a high-output 6 kW hour charger. A quick charge option will allow it to gain back 80 percent of its charge in just 40 minutes, too. Higher range, higher power performance version will be available at additional cost in 2018.
Nissan also tried to downplay the ‘EV’ identity of the car, arguing that it’s actually just a car – they’re trying to draw equivalence between electric vehicles and vehicles that use traditional fuel-injection vehicles, as a way of signaling that this will be a much more broad-reaching focus going forward in terms of market ambitions.

Nissan is also promoting its ProPILOT features here, which offer intelligent, hands-free parking, as well as SAE Level 2 features when driving on single-lane highways, including lane-keeping and maintaining distance between the car and vehicles ahead, with automatic acceleration and braking.
The new Leaf features regenerative braking, which allows for single-pedal driving if you’ve got the foot skills and sense of timing. It has enough friction to hold the vehicle stock still even when on an incline, according to Nissan.
On the inside, there’s a 7-inch full-color TFT touchscreen display, which provides the visuals for the new Safety Shield tech that shows you what’s going on around your car, and it also supports Apple CarPlay for iPhone users.
U.S. pricing starts at $29,990 (below current models) and the Leaf is slated to go on sale October 2 in Japan, and deliveries in the U.S., Canada and Europe are likely to begin in January, 2018. Nissan has said that pricing will be comparable to that of the current model, and that it feels “certain” it will be able to at least double or maybe even triple sales at home in Japan.

Nissan’s new LEAF is making its official world premiere today at 5:30 PM PDT (8:30 PM EDT). That’s when we’ll get the first detailed look at the car, though we’ve seen some teasing images of headlights and tail lights thus far.
This should be a major revamp of the Nissan all-electric car, which was one of the first ever actually produced and sold by a major automaker. The 2018 Nissan LEAF not only gets a new leaf, but also is said to be getting a 40 kWh battery that might offer as much as 150 miles of range per charge, with potential to upgrade to a 60 kWh pack for a boosted range of around 200 miles.
That’s still not quite as much range as Tesla’s Model 3 offers, or as much as the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV, either. But the Nissan LEAF will come equipped with the company’s ProPILOT semi-autonomous driver assistance features, which offers SAE Level 2 features, including lane-keeping, acceleration and braking control.
While you’re waiting for the stream above to start, take a look at the few images Nissan has released depicting the new LEAF thus far:

110,Scotland plans to ‘phase out’ gas and diesel cars by 2032,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/scotland-plans-to-phase-out-gas-and-diesel-cars-by-2032/,2017/09/05,"
Another country is looking to get rid of gas-powered vehicles entirely: Scotland, which wants to “phase out” new gas and diesel-powered cars entirely by 2032 (via The Independent). The Scottish government’s plan is set to beat the UK’s target by eight years, if all goes well, and also involves building out its roadway charging infrastructure to support the use of EVs instead.
The decision by Scotland to join in the effort to make cities and countries vehicle emission-free is not an isolated one. London has announced plans to become totally emission free by 2050, and France, Britain, Madrid and Mexico City have all made similar pledges, albeit with varying timeframes.
Some vehicle makers, likely anticipating a continued shift among international and municipal governments, have likewise outlined plans to move towards greener energy alternatives; Volvo is only going to make new hybrid and all-electric vehicles starting in 2019, and Aston Martin announced it plans to do the same beginning in the mid-2020s.

111,Google’s Street View cameras get a high-res update focused on AI,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/googles-street-view-cameras-get-a-high-res-update-focused-on-ai/,2017/09/05,"
Google has changed up the camera tech used in its roving fleet of Street View vehicles – the cars you sometimes see driving around with a spherical contraption atop their roofs. Wired reports that Google Street View cameras are getting an upgrade for the first time in eight years, which will mean clearer images in the consumer-facing Street View product, as well as better color rendering – but the camera upgrade is more important to Google as a way to help improve its mapping info.
The refined Street View hardware captures HD images from all sides, and can provide raw data to feed image recognition algorithms, potentially offering key data for maps and business information including place names, opening hours, methods of payment accepted and more – all of which is often displayed prominently in shop windows. Google currently rewards users for crowdsourcing this kind of information, but Street View cameras are tireless and never require incentives to contribute.
Google’s machine learning and AI investment means it can do a lot with higher resolution imaging data from its Street View camera cars, its engineers tell Wired. And better image quality, leading to better, more accurate and up-to-date business data, leads to better results for advertiser’s using Google platforms, which their core business in the end.
Mapping imagery is also a key desirable product for a range of other companies, including anyone trying to build autonomous vehicle technologies. Google said that it does indeed collaborate with Alphabet’s Waymo self-driving car tech subsidiary, per the report, but did not elaborate further and said the exchange of info is a two-way street.
The new Street View cars started capturing imagery on the roads last month, and will gradually roll out to more spots around the world.

112,Samsung secures self-driving car testing permit for California roads,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/samsung-secures-self-driving-car-testing-permit-for-california-roads/,2017/08/31,"
Samsung got approval to test autonomous vehicles on state roads in California, according to the CA Department of Motor Vehicle’s website. The DMV maintains an ongoing list of companies and organizations it has granted autonomous testing permits to, and that list includes a growing number of automakers and tech companies, including Apple, Nvidia, GM, BMW and now Samsung.
Samsung has already gotten the green light to test self-driving vehicles in South Korea, as we reported back in May, but its California license means the tech giant is likely looking to start testing its technology stateside as well, in the backyard of rivals including Waymo and Apple.
The South Korean company has already revealed modified Hyundai cars, equipped with test hardware built by Samsung including sensors and AI-powered computer modules. Samsung looks like it aims to provide software and platform for autonomy in a supply capacity at the very least, but its ambitions could extend further than that, too.
Samsung maintains a San Jose office, from which it could operate California-based tests. The company’s far-reaching supply relationships could give it an edge as a self-driving software platform provider, once the technology becomes more ubiquitous.

113,SpaceX runs its Tesla-powered pusher at 220 mph on Hyperloop test track,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/spacex-runs-its-tesla-powered-pusher-at-220-mph-on-hyperloop-test-track/,2017/08/31,"
Elon Musk apparently felt left out when student teams competed to achieve top speed on the SpaceX Hyperloop test track last weekend, because he decided to run the SpaceX pusher vehicle, which includes a Tesla drivetrain, down the track on its own to see how fast it could go.
The Tesla/SpaceX vehicle, which works basically like a Hyperloop tug boat to propel some of the student pods that don’t have their own built-in motor for acceleration, managed to get up to 220 mph in the sealed vacuum tunnel, which is faster than the winning student team at 201 mph.





 We took the SpaceX/Tesla Hyperloop pusher pod for a spin by itself a few days ago to see what it could do when not pushing student pods (some need a push to get going, e.g. passive maglev). Got up to 355 km/h (220 mph) before things started 🔥. Kind of like racing with a tugboat. Maybe able get past 500 km/h (about half speed of sound) next month with a few tweaks or maybe tiny pieces …
A post shared by Elon Musk (@elonmusk) on Aug 30, 2017 at 10:27pm PDT


The pusher got its own shell for the event (normally it looks like what you see below to get the student pods started) and Musk said that with a bit more work, including some minor design changes or added hardware, it could get up to around 500 km/h (311 mph, or roughly half the speed of sound).

This definitely means the bar is set higher for future student pods in the next SpaceX Hyperloop Pod design competition, which Musk confirmed will happen at this most recent event. In case you missed it, check out the video recap of that competition below.

114,Magna’s new MAX4 self-driving platform offers autonomy up to Level 4,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/magnas-max4-self-driving-platform-offers-autonomy-up-to-level-4/,2017/08/31,"

Top tier 1 automotive industry supplier Magna has introduced a new functional autonomous driving platform concept it’s showing off to automaker customers, which it says can work with any vehicle without impact to either car design or looks, and which can add scalable self-driving capabilities all the way up to SAE Level 4 (highly automated self-driving, which does not require human driver intervention).
The MAX4 platform introduced by Magna, which it debuted to media earlier this week in a modified Jeep Grand Cherokee, uses input from cameras, radar, ultrasonic and LiDAR sensors, along with onboard computing capabilities to offer an upgradable system that Magna says uses only a fraction of the power required by similar, existing solutions.
“The platform consists of multiple enabler subsystems, such as radars, LiDARs, cameras, compute platform, etc.,” explained Magna CTO Swamy Kotagiri, regarding how viable this is in terms of market-readiness. “All of these enablers are either fully or nearly production ready.”
Magna’s MAX4 also addresses a number of other issues that have been difficult in terms of adapting supplier platforms to existing vehicles, including making sure that cargo space in the back and room provided to passengers aren’t encroached upon. Magna also thought about user experience, and tried to hew close to existing Cruise Control implementations and interfaces, so that you enable it with a button-press and can disable it the same way, or by applying the brake pedal manually.

This is a natural progression for Magna, which has been building outs its self-driving capabilities in a bid to help address demand from its automaker OEM clients. Most recently, Magna used Level 3 self-driving test vehicles to conduct the first North American border crossing, during a drive that covered 300 miles in total across the U.S. and Canada, and during which the vehicle drove itself during 92 percent of the trip.
MAX4 is able to navigate both urban and highway, and Magna is now focused on getting it ready for production at scale and in significant volume. The final step for full autonomy, however, will rest with OEMs, who will take the base that MAX4 offers and complete the picture through implementation, according to Kotagiri.

115,Top-end Teslas get price drop thanks to production improvements,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/top-end-teslas-get-price-drop-thanks-to-production-improvements/,2017/08/30,"
Tesla’s most expensive vehicle offerings got a discount overnight thanks to improvements in the production efficiency of the 100 kWh batteries that are used in their construction. The discounts range from $3,500 to $5,000, depending on the model, and include both the Model S and Model X top trims.
As Electrek reports, the 100D models of both the X and the S got a $3,500 discount with the new pricing, and the P100D versions get a larger $5,000 price cut. These actually restore price levels to where they were for the highest available trim packages before a small increase was put in place in April, which came alongside a discount for entry-level vehicles.
These pricing changes affect current orders that have not yet been fulfilled, according to Electrek, which is a nice surprise. Improvements in the 100 kWH battery pack process should also help Tesla keep up with demand, which is growing at last check thanks to a halo effect spiking interest around the launch of the new, more affordable Model 3.
Here’s exactly how the new pricing structure breaks down:

Model S 100D: $97,500 -> $94,000
Model S P100D: $140,000 -> $135,000
Model X 100D: $99,500 -> $96,000
Model X P100D: $145,000 -> $140,000

116,Smart’s autonomous concept car literally says “Hello”,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/smarts-autonomous-concept-car-literally-says-hello/,2017/08/30,"
Smart’s concept of a future autonomous vehicle is, as you might expect from the Daimler-owned automaker, small and adorable. But it’s even easier to anthropomorphize than the existing Smart lineup, thanks to built-in features designed to support self-driving, like external displays front and back for communication, and fully transparent doors that looks like two large, wide open eyes.
The concept car, dubbed the ‘Smart vision EQ fortwo,’ is unsurprisingly tailor-made for car sharing. Daimler talks about its car2go service in the press release describing the vehicle almost immediately, outlining how it has 2.6 million global customers, and sees a rental start once every 1.4 seconds – a number which is steadily growing. The Smart vision EQ’s built-in displays are perfect for car2go shared use, and its “swarm intelligence” could make finding and starting a rental even easier.
Swarm intelligence would allow the vehicle to basically be constantly in motion on its own, relocating to where it’s most likely needed most based on historical data and demand projection analysis. This would basically allow car2go to operate more like an on-demand ride provider – meaning when you book a rental, the car comes to you.
Smart’s vision EQ fortwo has a LED panel right up front, as well as on the rear, and projection surfaces on the sides that can display messages, too. These will let potential customers know if the vehicle is hired, for instance, or even become personalized when someone rents one to display their name so they know for sure it’s their car. The front grille panel can also communicate with pedestrians and other cars, displaying turn signals, letting them know it’s safe to pass and more.

Those big glass doors offer an uninhibited view to passengers, but they can also be turned into translucent displays, showing information inward to passengers on board, or displaying info to the outside to onlookers, including weather, news, or potentially even ads (some car2go vehicles now sport advertising decals on occasion).
Smart describes a 1-to-1 sharing method, too, whereby the panels can be used to trigger discovery of nearby users looking for a ride, and flag them down. Paired with the electric battery onboard, which is only 30kWH but designed such that the vehicle would be able to charge consistently on its own between trips at power stations and inductive charging docks, it sounds like the perfect city sharing car.
Basically, Smart’s visions EQ fortwo sounds makes clear a lot of the long-term bets Daimler has made with car2go, and what they hope to accomplish with tech improvements in shoring up the weaknesses and major expenses of the service offering right now: autonomy and electrification would answer the biggest challenges, including finding parking, refuelling, and redistributing the fleet to accommodate traffic patterns and demand.
This is still just a concept, but Daimler-owned Mercedes-Benz Cars wants to put more than 10 new electric vehicles into production by 2022, and something like this seems a great candidate if it’s serious about its alternate mobility programs.

117,"MINI’s Electric Concept still looks like a MINI, but also screams ‘EV’",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/30/minis-electric-concept-still-looks-like-a-mini-but-also-screams-ev/,2017/08/30,"


The MINI Electric Concept is coming to the Frankfurt Motor Show, and its debut appearance will showcase the design changes that MINI has made to signal that this is indeed the first large-scale production fully electric MINI vehicle. MINI has offered electrified versions of its existing cars, but the Electric Concept is designed from the ground up as an EV, and not just a combustion-powered car with an electric drivetrain option.
The MINI Electric Concept is set to start rolling out on the roads in full production in 2019, which marks the original Mini’s 60-year anniversary. The lines of the car are reminiscent of those found on the rest of the MINI lineup, but it’s also got a lot of unique visual changes that clearly mark it as different, including a closed front grill since cooling air flow isn’t required. The headlights, charging hub, rearview mirror turning indicators and body paint all sport elements of a stylized plug icon, the clearest outward sign that this is indeed an electric car.

It’s based on the MINI 3 door design, and it also has the two doors up front along with the hatch in the rear. The car uses fibre glass body parts to help reduce drag and increase aerodynamics, and inside there are four seats. The electric drivetrain will come from the BMW i3 line, which will likely mean the two vehicles have roughly equivalent performance in terms of charge capacity, range and pick-up.
Also, in case you had any questions as to the MINI’s national roots, the rear LED tail lots show the Union Jack in dot matrix, with one half of the flag displayed on each.

Torc Robotics, a company focused on autonomous vehicle tech in the commercial world that’s turning its attention to the consumer market, is teaming up with leading auto industry chip supplier NXP Semiconductor on self-driving systems. Torc is using NXP’s radar-specific chips to boost 360-degree imaging and offer real-time info about a vehicle’s surroundings to its self-driving systems.
The Torc and NXP partnership will push efforts on behalf of Torc to deliver SAE Level 4 and Level 5 autonomy to the consumer vehicle market. The partnership will also extend beyond a simple supplier/supplied relationship, as both will work together to test new types of radar tech in autonomous system deployment.
Torc’s team boasts engineers with experience dating all the way back to the 207 DARPA Urban Challenge for self-driving vehicles, but until recently it has focused on commercial, industrial and military markets. In June, it unveiled its consumer platform plans, and two Lexus RX SUVs it’s been using for testing on real roads.
The goal for Torc is to help automotive OEMs and top-tier suppliers negotiate the new landscape of self-driving, with guidance gleaned from their own experience, and with hardware and software platforms to fill in the gaps in existing automaker autonomy programs.

Another automaker is vowing to turn its entire lineup a little more green: Aston Martin told the Financial Times that it’ll offer vehicles exclusively with hybrid and electric cars by the middle of next decade.
It’s not as audacious a goal as it might’ve seemed even just a few years ago; Volvo has committed to selling only hybrid or electric cars by 2019, and Britain and France have both outlined plans to ban the sale of non-electric or hybrid vehicles by 2040.
Aston Martin’s announcement is significant because it’s a high-end luxury performance car maker, however, whose target demographic is precisely motoring enthusiasts. Aston Martin had previously announced plans to launch its first fully electric car, the Rapid-e, by 2019.
Don’t expect news of automakers intending to focus solely on hybrids and electrics to stop anytime soon; the writing is on the wall, now it’s just a question of in what order the dominoes fall.

Another major automaker is setting up a dedicated joint venture to build EVs for the growing demand in China, joining Ford and Volkswagen: This time, it’s Nissan-Renault, which will work with China’s Dongfeng Motor, an automaker it partnered with last year to open its first factory in China.
Automakers from outside China basically need a local dancing partner in order to make and sell vehicles in the country, without incurring huge import taxes that would basically render their operations unsustainable. Previously, automakers were limited to setting up two joint ventures with Chinese partners to produce cars in-country, but Beijing has allowed the creation of a third joint venture – provided it’s dedicated entirely to EVs.
Renault-Nissan’s new partnership with Dongfeng is called eGT New Energy Automotive Company, and it’ll be split between Nissan with 25 percent ownership, Renault with another 25, and Dongfeng with the remaining 50, according to Reuters. The first vehicle from the JV will be a new electric vehicle based on one of Renault-Nissan’s subcompact crossover SUV platform designs.
Automakers are racing to build out their EV construction and sales capacity in China thanks to strong incentives put in place by the Chinese government for the market. China is also enforcing strict quotas on overall vehicle sales, requiring that a full 8 percent of any automaker sales in the country be either pure electric or plug-in hybrid by 2018, with incremental increases in that percentage every year after that.
This could end up helping with electrification abroad, too, since it’ll help automakers reconfigure their operations to focus on developing EV tech and electric-specific vehicle designs.

121,Ford and Domino’s to deliver pizza using self-driving cars in new test,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/ford-and-dominos-to-deliver-pizza-using-self-driving-cars-in-new-test/,2017/08/29,"
Ford and Domino’s are teaming up on a research trial that will see Ford cars equipped with self-driving tech delivering pizzas to regular consumers, as a way of figuring out how everyday people will react to, and interact with, autonomous service vehicles in the future.
Ford Fusion Hybrid Autonomous Cars will be used in the test, outfitted with pizza containers created by Domino’s partner Roush Enterprises designed to keep the pizzas warm en route, and to unlock when a customer types in their unique delivery code. The vehicles will be available to randomly selected Domino’s customers who order pizza in the Ann Arbor, Mich. area, with the ability on the customer end to opt in to receiving a delivery via AV when they’re selected.
Both Ford and Domino’s will be using the test to see how people react to receiving pizzas via self-driving vehicles. Ford considers the customer and user experience aspects of autonomous driving technology a core part of the overall platform it’s developing, Ford Autonomous and Electric Vehicles VP Sherif Marakby tells me, and it’s using this real-world trial to test its assumptions and help it develop that aspect of the product it hopes to commercialize in just a few years’ time.

“The unique thing is that we’re doing this ethnographic research in parallel to developing the AV tech itself,” Marakby said. “The reason we’re doing that is that we’re going to learn things we didn’t know, and we want to have the opportunity from a timing perspective to incorporate these changes into the car, or the interface to the car and the consumer interaction.”
This isn’t something that Ford is necessarily used to – it’s done a lot to improve its cars from a core technology perspective over the years, but it has decades of experience with its own categories of consumer to know what they want to some degree in each successive generation. With AVs, there’s a lot more up in the air.
“Usually, in the auto business, you know the customer and you’re planning certain things for the consumer,” Marakby explained. “In this case, we’re still trying to understand, and we’re working with partners who understand the consumer and figuring out what we need to do to the vehicle in parallel as we’re developing the tech.”
Once ordered, customers will be able to track their delivery’s progress through the Domino’s app.
Domino’s and Ford have worked together on a number of projects in the past, including in building a way to order pizzas via Ford’s in-car SYNC software and apps platform. Their pre-existing relationship led to conversations around the potential for AVs in food delivery.
“The two companies decided to work together a few months ago,” Marakby told me. “Ford is developing the autonomous vehicle technology, and Domino’s is actually really focused on the technology aspect of how to improve the delivery business. I think there’s general understanding that autonomous vehicles can enable a lot of things for delivery that will make the whole delivery process easier, simpler and maybe even more user-friendly.”
That’s how the companies then decided to set up the “ethnographic research” project they’re beginning now, as Marakby describes it. Its aim is to figure out what would be needed in a go-to-market strategy in order to satisfy consumer needs and demands from an autonomous service like this one.

Marakby reiterated that it’s key to their strategy that Ford isn’t waiting for the autonomous component to be road-ready to do this, and that’s by design: The automaker believes that a firm understanding of what the consumer wants in terms of user experience when interfacing with AVs is just as important and being able to navigate real roads.
Ford’s goal is still to build, at scale, autonomous fleets capable of servicing industries like this one in time for the 2021 time frame, Marakby says, and so figuring out what people want in a delivery or transportation AV, and doing it now while details like vehicle design are still being finalized is important.
The autonomous cars used in this trial will still have someone behind the wheel – safety drivers will be present to ensure everything goes well and to observe, and take over when necessary. But the real test here isn’t for the drivers, or even the self-driving aspects of the self-driving cars used – it’s all about the end user, and what they think of taking delivery of their piping hot pizza pies from something other than another person.

122,BMW adds a sport package to the i3 electric vehicle,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/28/bmw-adds-a-sport-package-to-the-i3-electric-vehicle/,2017/08/28,"
The BMW i3 will soon be available with a sport package that adds a few ponies, sportier wheels and a slightly different look to let other drivers know you’re serious about not using gasoline. The updated model is called the i3s and marks the first time the automaker added a dedicated sport package to the i3 or i7, though the i8 is already sporty enough.
This package comes as part of the i3’s mid-model refresh and should add a boost to the little i3, which is already a blast to drive. The low curb weight and peppy electric powertrain results in a car that’s surprisingly quick and responsive. The 2018 i3S comes equipped with a motor that outputs 184 hp and 199 lb-ft. That’s a slight boost over the standard motor that has 170 hp and 184 lb-ft of torque. The i3s will also come with a stiffer suspension and wider 20-inch wheels.
The mid-size i3 came out as a 2014 model, well ahead of the similarly sized Chevy Bolt and Tesla Model 3. Yet despite the head start, the i3’s short 87 mile range and $43,000 starting price kept the car from being a mass-market hit. And it doesn’t seem as if BMW is adding range to the model, either.
When compared to other electric vehicles, the upgraded i3s is still a sad option to the Chevy Bolt or Model 3, which are both available at lower starting prices and easily double the range of the BMW. However, the i3 is still offered with a range-extending generator that essentially turns the vehicle into a hybrid vehicle that can partly run on gasoline.
BMW is not dropping the EV standard, though. The i3s’s new motors clearly state that the car company is still working on electric vehicles.
Pricing on the 2018 models have yet to be released. Look for that next month at the Frankfurt Motor Show.

Uber’s engineering blog has just posted an interesting piece on the company’s web-based tool for exploring and visualizing data from self-driving car research. It’s a smart look at an impressive platform, and definitely has nothing to do with a long piece published last week lauding a similar platform in use by one of Uber’s most serious rivals, Waymo.
Okay, maybe it has a little to do with that. The piece, over at The Atlantic, is quite interesting, but seemed rather to suggest that Waymo is unique in its approach to improving its autonomous cars’ AI. In fact, it’s likely that every company working on this stuff has a pretty similar approach, at least if they’re keeping pace with the state of the art.
The cool secret technique that in fact all the companies in question know about is the possibility of using and learning from data that’s been hoarded over a million miles of test driving. Once you’ve driven that far, you have so much data that you can mix and match it in a virtual environment and let the AI navigate it just as if it were real. The computer doesn’t know the difference! Meanwhile you can tweak the data, watch for unusual events or compare multiple models.
The Uber post just focuses on visualization of this data, and with details on its tools, which are wisely web-based, leading to easy collaboration and quick turnaround on new features. These days web apps can access the GPUs, communicate in real time and so on — no need for a local client any more for many things. It makes for cool GIFs.
What the post doesn’t really get into, but is pretty much a foregone conclusion given the sophistication of the tools they’re showing off, is how to further multiply the data’s value by essentially making up the environment out of whole cloth.
Take for example the problem of dealing with a major event like a parade or protest. Would you let your naive self-driving car run free during a marathon just so it has a chance to learn how the runners act? Of course not.
What you can do is open up your excellent map of Boston, shut down several main thoroughfares, add lots and lots of pedestrians and erratic drivers to the virtual world and then set your AI driver agents to work getting around. You’ll see when it breaks down, how it reacts to situations it’s never seen in real life and so on. It’s like a thought experiment that generates usable data and improves the AI.
So maybe the timing is just a coincidence, but it seems like this post, while cool on its own, is Uber’s way of saying “Hey, we’re doing this too. Look!” Because at this point, if you’re an autonomous car developer and you’re not using simulations with all kinds of variations, you’re going to have a bad time.

124,New Uber CEO may get $200 million,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/28/new-uber-ceo-may-get-200-million/,2017/08/28,"
The Uber board offered Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi the new role on Sunday. And according to Bloomberg data, they would have had to pay him a lot of money to woo him.
Khosrowshahi, who has been at the helm of Expedia since 2005, had almost $185 million in unvested stock options when the offer was made Sunday. He probably wouldn’t forgo that kind of money unless Uber could offer him more.
Executives are usually given a salary, with much of the compensation tied up in stock awards. This is designed to motivate them to grow the company’s value and to stay in the job.
With a $68 billion valuation, Uber can afford a significant compensation package. When Uber bought Otto, it was enough to net founder Anthony Levandowski $250 million. 
Because Uber is a private company, it won’t need to disclose Khosrowshahi’s salary and equity stake.
According to The New York Times, Charter Communications CEO Thomas Rutledge was the highest paid CEO last year, with $98 million awarded for just 2016. CBS’ Les Moonves followed with $68.6 million and Madison Square Garden CEO David O’Connor took home $54 million.
Khosrowshahi received nearly $95 million in pay in 2015, making him one of the most highly paid leaders in corporate America. The vast majority of that sum came from a package of stock options that the online travel company gave him in March of 2015 and that was expected to vest over several years.
His pay wasn’t always so rich, however. In 2014, Khosrowshahi’s compensation at Expedia totaled $9.6 million. Last year, he took home $2.4 million in salary and bonus compensation.

125,Uber has offered CEO role to Dara Khosrowshahi from Expedia,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/27/breaking-uber-has-selected-a-ceo/,2017/08/27,"
An Uber spokesperson tells us its board has reached a decision to offer someone the CEO role.
“The Board has voted and will announce the decision to employees first.”
We’ve confirmed from a source familiar with the situation that this person is Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of Expedia. Kara Swisher of Recode was first with the news.
Also read: Who is new Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi?
Both Meg Whitman and Jeff Immelt had been considered for the top job, but both publicly tweeted that they didn’t want it. Some reports on Sunday suggested that Whitman was still in the running anyway.
The Uber CEO seat has been vacant since June, when co-founder Travis Kalanick resigned. His departure came after former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder completed an investigation into the company’s culture. Lawsuits and allegations of sexism are what prompted the investigation.
Since then, the Uber board has been involved with its own lawsuits. Early investor Benchmark Capital, which has one of the board seats, sued Kalanick claiming that he did not disclose material information about the company’s problems. They now want Kalanick off the board and say they would not have granted him the power to appoint two additional board seats, which have not been filled. Early investor and former board member, Shervin Pishevar, has intervened in the lawsuit, accusing Benchmark of leaking confidential information.
Khosrowshahi has headed up Expedia since 2005, after serving as the chief financial officer of IAC for seven years. Expedia has done very well in the stock market under his term and is up 32% so far this year. The stock has nearly tripled in the past five years.
Several Uber investors have told us that they are happy with the decision, saying that Khosrowshai has the right operational experience to get the job done.
According to a recent Glassdoor survey based on employee feedback, Khosrowshahi was ranked 39th among the highest-rated CEOs, with more than 2,200 employee reviews combining to assign him a 94 percent approval rating.

126,Jeff Immelt says he’s not going to be the CEO of Uber,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/27/jeff-immelt-says-hes-not-going-to-be-the-ceo-of-uber/,2017/08/27,"
Former GE CEO Jeff Immelt says he’s not going to be the CEO of Uber.
After weeks of being considered for the top job, Immelt tweeted:


I have decided not to pursue a leadership position at Uber. I have immense respect for the company & founders – Travis, Garrett and Ryan.
— Jeff Immelt (@JeffImmelt) August 27, 2017



He says it was his decision. HP Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman recently tweeted something similar. (The NYTimes and Recode are reporting that she may get an offer anyway.)
While Immelt didn’t state a reason, it’s possible that he didn’t like that Uber’s board has been embroiled in lawsuits and other drama.
The company has been searching for a permanent CEO ever since Travis Kalanick resigned in June. His departure followed months of negative publicity about Uber’s company culture and a patent lawsuit with Waymo, the self-driving car division of Google parent, Alphabet.
Kalanick remains on the board and has been sued by early investor Benchmark, which holds another board seat.
The stakes are high for the $68 billion company. This valuation is just paper money until a liquidity event, like an IPO or acquisition.
The co-founders and early investors own stakes potentially worth billions of dollars. The recent turmoil at the company has put undue pressure on the founders and investors, who want to make sure their golden goose lays the eggs.

The new paradigm for human-bot communication




“The technology is essentially here… We have machines that can make a bunch of quick decisions that could drastically reduce traffic fatalities, drastically improve the efficiency of our transportation grid, and help solve things like carbon emissions that are causing the warming of the planet.”
Interestingly, this statement didn’t come from a futurist like Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg or Jeff Bezos; this was President Obama discussing autonomous vehicles in an interview with WIRED last fall.
Over the last year, we have seen many groundbreaking announcements regarding autonomous cars, from companies like Ford promoting its autonomous vehicle leader to the position of CEO, to Tesla’s NHSTA investigation showing a 40 percent decrease in accidents with Autopilot enabled and Audi beginning mass-market sales of a “Level 3” autonomous car.
Nevertheless, many questions in the world of autonomous vehicles remain unanswered. How will autonomous cars make ethical decisions, as in the case of the “trolley problem”? How will cities, streets and parking change? What will happen to the millions of people employed as ridesharing drivers or long-haul truck drivers? What is the right package of sensors to drive autonomous vehicles?
We believe that many of the open questions about autonomous vehicles will be answered not just by technological innovation but by the emerging business models around autonomous vehicles. For example, if regulators decide to tax autonomous vehicles based on miles traveled within a city, there will be different incentives for vehicles to stay close by to maximize trips and minimize costs. If car companies decide to sell cars directly to fleet operators instead of consumers, they will allocate marketing and research and development dollars differently.
There is no better indicator for how companies will make decisions across many technology, business and societal questions than their underlying business models and profit motives.
Here are what we see as several of the key questions and implications for autonomous vehicles today.
What will the autonomous vehicle operating system look like?

Apple, Google and Microsoft — iOS, Android and Windows. The three biggest companies in the world today all control (or have de facto control of) their own operating systems. Why? Because controlling an operating system is an incredibly important place in a value chain. Operating system providers provide an abstraction layer over hardware (commoditizing hardware providers) and own a direct channel to end users (allowing them to tax anyone else who wants to access those end users).
In the world of servers, desktops, laptops, smartphones and tablets, Apple, Google and Microsoft each have a unique strategy to capture value from their operating system. Apple uses its operating system to extract higher margins on its hardware business, Google uses its operating system to earn more revenue from its ad business and Microsoft charges directly for its operating system and the key applications that run on top of it.
Now, automakers and technology companies are all in a race to build the software that will drive autonomous vehicles, but it’s unclear how those companies will monetize their software. Tesla is pursuing an Apple-like approach, where they will build an integrated hardware-software stack; companies like Baidu and Udacity are building “open-source” self-driving car tech that will help them sell complementary products; and companies like Mobileye and Uber seem to be forging partnerships where they will become software providers to automobile manufacturers.
It is likely that several models will emerge for monetizing the operating system layer for vehicles, and these models will deeply impact how different companies invest in R&D, marketing, lobbying and operations. If the Tesla vertical integration model wins out, expect to continue seeing flashy marketing and sleekly styled vehicles, because high-priced, high-margin “hardware”/vehicle sales will be the main driver of business. If the Baidu “open source” model wins out, expect to see many low-cost automobiles from different manufacturers and Baidu monetizing their open-source software by selling other services.
Some of these consequences are obvious, but there are also some less obvious effects. For example, companies that operate a “closed” hardware/software ecosystem may be less likely to share their data with others, and this could lead to difficulties in developing a national system of legislation for autonomous vehicles because of public concerns around safety and equity. Additionally, if one company ends up taking an early lead but is reticent to share their data or algorithms, they may be able to shape regulation in a way that makes it difficult for others to build competing systems.
How will users pay for transportation? As a service or own cars?
Today, companies like BMW are making a series of bets on what the future will look like for transportation consumption. BMW is continuing to sell cars directly to consumers; however, they are also selling “transportation as a service” where consumers can rent free-floating cars, hail a car with a driver or, in the future, order a car without a driver. Their belief is that people will want to consume transportation differently at different times and in different places, and they want to offer all options through a single app.
On the other hand, companies like Mazda believe that consumers will always want to drive, and they are building/selling vehicles to a “core customer who loves driving.”
These two views are not necessarily at odds with one another, and different segments of the market will want different things. However, the relative sizes of the transportation-as-a-service and the “own a car” markets will change in the future, and it is likely that more people will choose to pay for transportation on demand rather than own a car, which is often an under-utilized asset.
It will be difficult to strike a balance between letting the industry guide regulation and letting regulation dictate what the industry decides to build.
 
The more we veer toward the transportation-as-a-service world, the more differently car companies will operate in the future. Automobile manufacturers are today the biggest spenders in the entire advertising industry. If consumers no longer purchase cars and only purchase Uber rides and Zipcar rentals, that will drastically change the billions of dollars spent on automobile advertising. It also will change the set of profit pools across the entire automotive industry.
If ridesharing companies can “commoditize” automobiles such that consumers no longer care what type of car they are in to get from place A to place B, they will be able to capture a significant portion of the profits in the transportation industry and reinvest those profits in their technology platforms and marketplaces.
What does it mean if ridesharing companies take more and more revenue and profits away from car and truck manufacturers? One major impact will be that ridesharing companies will be more likely to invest in automation to cut costs rather than focus on ways to employ drivers (who will buy cars), and this could rapidly accelerate the loss of driving jobs. Another major impact would be that car dealerships become less relevant as a distribution channel for cars as ridesharing companies would likely prefer to buy in bulk from automakers to lower costs.
Who generates the data? Who processes the data? And who owns the data?
Autonomous vehicles will both ingest and generate vast amounts of data. Vehicles need driving data to train their neural networks, mapping data to navigate roads and avoid obstacles, regulatory data to understand speed limits and parking regulations and passenger data to create personalized trip experiences suited to each rider. At the same time, autonomous vehicles will be generating terabytes of data each day from cameras, radar, lidar, sonar, GPS and other sensors that can be used to further improve the cars’ driving models, a city’s traffic planning or a ridesharing company’s route optimization algorithms.
This data intake and data exhaust will not only require new infrastructure and software, it also will require new business models around the processing, sharing and usage of data. Already we have seen a number of companies form partnerships to either gain access to or build new sets of data around high-definition maps in order to ensure they have access to a key input to operating autonomous vehicles. Another critical piece of the data puzzle is companies that use human intelligence to produce training data for machines. For the foreseeable future, these “human in the loop” systems will be key to generate high-quality training data and feedback loops.

The issues of who owns data, who can access data and who will process the data will be a critical question for companies and regulators over the next several years. As vehicles generate and consume more and more data, it will be critical to watch who controls the data and how they decide to monetize the data. There likely will be a number of large companies that are built solely around the collection and cleaning of data, and how these companies work with other players in the automotive space is currently being explored.
What portion of the value chain will capture the most value?
In the traditional world of desktop and mobile operating systems, operating systems are able to capture value by commoditizing hardware suppliers and aggregating consumers, so that other application developers have easy access to a development platform with easy-to-use tools and a distribution channel with a large audience of buyers.
In the world of automobiles, this seems to suggest that companies like Uber and Lyft have the best shot at becoming the central point for demand-side aggregation and supply-side commoditization. Ridesharing customers don’t care too much about the actual vehicle they are riding in, and they provide an aggregation point for consumers who wish to access a pool of transportation options. Lyft’s recent announcement to build a new self-driving division and self-driving system for car manufacturers suggests they are looking at this as an important opportunity.
The world isn’t going to flip a switch one day to go from humans driving automobiles to autonomous vehicles.
 
However, this industry is still young, and everyone — from automotive suppliers like Delphi to pure technology companies like Alphabet — want to make sure they can capture a piece of the transportation value chain. This could happen in many different ways. Perhaps Tesla will be able to develop an integrated supply chain from parts to rides that creates the best possible user experience, or maybe Ford will find a way to bring the most efficient driving software to market that every other manufacturer needs to license.
Companies that are providing higher-level services to consumers and businesses that are in the best position to bring supply and demand together are likely to create the most value and profit pools.
In any case, whoever wins this race to capture profits will be in a position to invest more in research, invest more in marketing and continue to innovate faster than competitors. This will lead to the winners helping to craft the public messages on autonomous vehicles, leading the industry on recommendations for tax policies and working closely with local, state and national officials to reshape cities and society.
What is the impact and role of regulators in the development of autonomous vehicles?
Technology companies have not had a strong history of working with regulators (or with automobile companies), and while companies like Airbnb and Uber have struggled to figure this out, automobile manufacturers, more than anyone else, have a reputation for working closely with the government to understand (and potentially shape) regulations and compliance.

Regulators should and need to be a critical part of the development and introduction of autonomous vehicles. It will be difficult to strike a balance between letting the industry guide regulation and letting regulation dictate what the industry decides to build, but if they can get this right, it will lead to major benefits in terms of reduced traffic deaths, lower emissions and better transportation for everyone.
The world isn’t going to flip a switch one day to go from humans driving automobiles to autonomous vehicles. For a long time to come, human-driven vehicles and autonomous vehicles will co-exist, and this is something that regulators need to keep in mind.
If there is one thing for the general public and regulators to pay attention to in the next 3-5 years, it is how companies plan to make money on autonomous vehicles. The business models will drive decision making, and these decisions will have very important consequences for the future of transportation.

128,Pioneer’s AVH-2330NEX gives you both Android Auto and CarPlay — without a new car price tag,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/25/pioneers-avh-2330nex-gives-you-both-android-auto-and-carplay-without-a-new-car-price-tag/,2017/08/25,"
CarPlay and Android Auto can only really be described as what you’d call a “slow burn.” They both debuted quite a few years ago, but getting access to them via first-party infotainment systems didn’t happen with the pace early adopters might be accustomed to. Luckily, a variety of third-party aftermarket in-car audio and infotainment decks offer an option for those who don’t want to buy a new car or wait for their automaker of choice to catch up with the times.
Pioneer’s new AVH-2330NEX, which the company officially revealed in May this year and started shipping just recently, offers both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay in a single package, which is very convenient if you happen to spend time on both platforms. It also offers a CD/DVD slot, accessible via the sliding front faceplate, and a 7-inch resistive touchscreen with 800×480 screen resolution. Physical buttons are included below the display, as is Bluetooth for hands-free and stereo streaming.
The whole thing comes in a double-DIN package that will work with a wide range of vehicles, with or without trim kits depending on your car. It also can plug into factory steering wheel controls, as well as first-party and aftermarket backup cameras. The AVH-2330NEX also ships with its own microphone, which is great because, in my experience, it offered far better voice recognition for things like Google Assistant and Siri, as well as for calls, when compared with factory-installed microphones shipping on vehicles.

At $500, the AVH-2330NEX (and the AVH-2300NEX,which is the same minus the inclusion of HD radio support, a second camera input and remote control) is far cheaper than either buying a new car, or even in many cases paying for the infotainment upgrade package that will get you access to CarPlay and Android Auto in stock vehicles. It’s also a big boost for even factory sound systems, as it greatly improved the audio quality of both Bluetooth and wired music and podcast playback in my 2013 Nissan Rogue thanks to its built-in DAC.
But the real benefit here is access to your mobile OS of choice, right in your dash, front and center where you want it when driving. Plus, thanks to a standard USB adapter, you can switch between both using various cables, including micro-USB, USB-C and Lightning depending on your device’s requirements.

I found that both CarPlay and Android Auto ran well on the Pioneer 2330NEX, and I encountered no issues with either during many hours of extensive testing. Text was large and legible on the 7-inch display, as were icons and other interface elements. Animations and transitions were smooth, too, and I never encountered any kind of lag, which can happen on underpowered infotainment systems running these in-car mobile software systems.
The other thing I was a bit wary of going into testing the AVH-2330NEX was the lack of a capacitive touchscreen. It uses a resistive unit instead, which historically hasn’t been as good for touch interfaces on electronic devices: That was one of the iPhone’s chief strengths, in fact — it brought capacitive touchscreens to mass-market mobile devices, offering a much better overall user experience.
Surprisingly, the resistive screen made very little difference versus capacitive in-car units I’ve tried in the past. I never encountered errors with missed touch input, and the screen felt responsive enough. I suspect that’s a combination of the tech having advanced over the years and an infotainment deck not requiring the same high level of responsiveness as a smartphone in order to feel like it’s working properly.

Either way, the resistive display works perfectly fine and keeps the cost down. It does, however, mean that the AVH-2330NEX has a plastic-covered display that does not do well in direct sunlight. In fact, that’s my single major complaint with the unit: The screen doesn’t look terrific in bright light. It’s still perfectly usable, but it’s not ideal.
Aside from CarPlay and Android Auto, the Pioneer AVH-2330NEX offers a lot of great features, including support for a backup camera. That also worked flawlessly in my testing, kicking in whenever I put my car in reverse. The steering wheel controls are also great (though that’ll depend a bit on your car make and model). One small caveat there, too: It’s unlikely you’ll be able to map your call button to Siri or Android Assistant, but the Pioneer deck itself has a dedicated hardware button with a mic label that lets you activate those at any time with relative ease and a minimum of distraction.

129,Pishevar accuses Benchmark of leaking info about Uber,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/25/pishevar-accuses-benchmark-of-leaking-info-about-uber/,2017/08/25,"
Some Uber investors are demanding that the company inspect its records to find evidence of Benchmark Capital leaking confidential information to employees and others.
On the heels of yesterday’s motion to intervene in the Benchmark lawsuit, lawyers for Uber investors Shervin Pishevar and Stephen Russell have submitted a “Rule 220 demand,” which we’ve obtained.
According to the document, these Uber shareholders are demanding that 13 potential sources of information get examined, including communication between Benchmark board members and Uber employees, particularly related to the Eric Holder investigation into the company. “The stockholders demand the rights to inspect all books and records.”
The demand also references Pishevar’s letter to the Uber board about Benchmark, which he submitted yesterday. 
Pishevar, a close confidant of Kalanick, has taken the former Uber CEO’s side in the legal battle with early Uber investor, Benchmark Capital. 
Co-founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick was pressured to resign in June, following months of negative publicity and an investigation into the company’s culture. The turn of events was partly kicked off by former employee Susan Fowler’s blog post, which alleged that Uber had a sexist company culture. There have also been legal battles, particularly with Waymo, the self-driving car division of Google parent, Alphabet.
Now the drama relates to the selection of Uber’s next CEO. Benchmark wants Kalanick off the board and Pishevar wants Benchmark off. Former G.E. CEO Jeff Immelt is one of the candidates that the board has been speaking to.
The stakes are high for the company, which had a $68.5 billion valuation in its last private round.
We’ve requested comment from Uber.
See below for the demand.

130,Tesla streaming music service hinted at in recent software update,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/25/tesla-streaming-music-service-hinted-at-in-recent-software-update/,2017/08/25,"
Tesla CEO Elon Musk himself has dropped hints that the car and energy company wants to also offer its own musical solution for playlists in the car, and now we have more evidence that’s on its way. Electrek reports that software clues from the most recent updates pushed out to Tesla cars include a reference to a music service called “TTunes.”
There’s nothing there yet in terms of something users can actually try out for themselves, but it’s another indicator that Tesla is working on something around music or streaming within vehicles. Reports from late June indicated that Tesla was in talks with record labels around streaming rights, too, which is probably a sign that where there’s smoke with this software update clue, there’s fire.

Way back in early June, Elon Musk himself gave one of his trademark teaser comments around Tesla’s thinking on music during the company’s annual general shareholder meeting. Musk said that it’s “very hard to find good playlists or good matching algorithms” for driving using currently available software and streaming services, and also noted that we could expect an announcement from Tesla about fixing that problem later this year.
Tesla has an event coming up in September to reveal its electric semi truck, so maybe we’ll hear more about ‘TTunes’ or whatever it ends up being called then. Also please call it ‘TTunes’ because it’s very endearingly dumb.

131,Pishevar intervenes in Benchmark-Kalanick lawsuit,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/24/pishevar-sends-another-letter-to-uber-board-about-benchmark/,2017/08/24,"
Early Uber investor and former board member Shervin Pishevar is speaking out against Benchmark again. This time, he penned a letter to Uber’s board, demanding that Benchmark Capital drop its lawsuit against former CEO Travis Kalanick. He also filed a legal motion, asking for the case to be dismissed, saying in his letter to the board that he had “no choice.”
The letter says Pishevar has “tried in every way possible to convince my friends at Benchmark to drop this lawsuit, to end their public campaign against the founder and the company and to divest their shares under a proposal which would reward them hugely for their investment.” But Benchmark has “refused to meet” with Pishevar.
Pishevar accuses Benchmark of violating fiduciary duty, by its willingness to “talk to others inappropriately.” He also accuses Benchmark’s Kris Frederickson of convincing Gautam Gupta, Uber’s head of finance, to go to another company where he owned shares.
Pishevar claims that Benchmark has also conferred with Lowercase Capital in an attempt to remove Arianna Huffington from the board.
Recently, Pishevar circulated a petition attempting to pressure Benchmark to sell most of its shares and give up its board seat.
Last year, at our Disrupt event in San Francisco, TC talked with Pishevar about the venture market and specifically about Benchmark’s Bill Gurley, who recently stepped off of Uber’s board, installing his partner Matt Cohler in his stead. Said Pishevar in that stage appearance, “I have tremendous respect for Bill Gurley. He’s a friend of mine. I look up to him. Him and Matt Cohler actually referred Uber to me for the Series B.”
At the time, Pishevar was working as a venture capitalist with Menlo Ventures, which went on to lead that round.
Pishevar declined to comment for this story. We also reached out to Benchmark, which has yet to respond.
Here is the full text of the letter and below it, you’ll find the motion his attorneys filed.
Uber Technologies Inc.c/o Garrett CampChairman of the Board Directors1455 Market StreetSan Francisco, CA 94103



August 24, 2017
 
Dear Uber Board of Directors.


I write to inform you that, along with Steve Russell, I have come to the conclusion that I have no choice but to seek to intervene in the unfortunate lawsuit that Benchmark Capital has brought against Travis Kalanick, the founder and former CEO of Uber.

 

As you know, I have tried in every way possible to convince my friends at Benchmark to drop this lawsuit, to end their public campaign against the founder and the company, and to divest their shares under a proposal which would reward them hugely for their investment. I have called for Benchmark to resign from the Board by proposing a specific plan that would allow Benchmark to reduce its holdings so that the rest of the Board can move forward constructively to address the challenges of building our company, securing new infusions of major capital, and recruiting a world-class CEO to oversee our continued growth.

 

Instead, Benchmark has refused to meet with me to address these concerns. I asked as a friend to “have a rational, adult conversation,” to “have a conversation and try to make peace on behalf of all.” Benchmark told me they looked forward to talking with me “when this is over” but saw no possibility of “a meaningful conversation” with me about these issues.

 

But they have been more than willing to talk to others, inappropriately, and in violation of their fiduciary duty. They reached out directly to employees in a letter, which is utterly inappropriate for a venture capital firm to do. Benchmark principal Kris Fredrickson helped recruited Gautam Gupta, the head of finance and effectively the acting Uber CFO, to another company where he owned shares without ever informing Uber in fact, Frederickson told his partner and Uber board member Bill Gurley six months earlier, but Gurley never told Travis Kalanick, exacerbating the crisis facing the Company in May 2017 when Gupta left. Even more troubling, we have been told that Benchmark has been conferring with Lowercase Capital with respect to adverse action against Uber, indicating that they are seeking to remove Arianna Huffington from the Board and, in clear violation of their fiduciary duties, wrongfully leaked highly confidential details from the investigation by former Attorney General Eric Holder.







 

Benchmark even intruded itself into staff recommendations made by Holder, urging – contrary to the CEO’s wishes – that Holder recommend that the General Counsel be retained, rather than offered a promotion, lest that be seen negatively; yet another inappropriate intrusion by a venture capital investor, this time in an independent investigation

 

And perhaps most tellingly of all, Benchmark appears determined to insert its own candidate as CEO, Meg Whitman, prior to addressing any future issues, telling me that they “see no meaningful discussion without an acceptable CEO candidate being hired… uninfected by improper influences.” The “improper influences” here are Benchmark’s own efforts to control the company. They have no interest in reaching a peaceful accord which will allow this great company to grow even more, to recruit a world-class CEO, to secure further important funding. Clearly, they have a different agenda than ours.

 

Benchmark’s investment of $27 million has grown to some $8.4 billion because of the outstanding leadership of Travis Kalanick and his team. Benchmark recognized as much, even as it was encouraging Travis to resign. For a venture capital firm to then turn around, having threatened Mr. Kalanick with a public campaign if he did not resign, and then launch the campaign anyway – complete with the filing of a frivolous lawsuit notwithstanding an arbitration clause that prohibits such lawsuits from being brought in the first instance – has unfortunately convinced us that Benchmark is not operating in good faith, does not have the company’s best interests at heart, and instead is seeking to take advantage of the current circumstances to try to take control of the Board. Conduct so completely at odds with Benchmark’s fiduciary duty cannot be left unanswered, particularly at this terrible time for Mr. Kalanick and his family. We all owe a huge debt to Travis and his team for their tireless work in imagining, creating, and building Uber. I know how proud Bonnie Kalanick was of her son’s work, and it is an affront to her memory which we cannot silently tolerate that her passing should become the occasion for a secretive and personal assault on her son by those who, by sheer dint of his hard work and determination and that of his team, he has made wealthy beyond all their other investments







 

The lawsuit brought by Benchmark seeks to cancel the Voting Agreement amendments adopted in 2016, when the Saudi Government’s Public Investment Fund made a $3.5 billion dollar investment in Uber. The Agreement was amended to give the Saudis the right to designate a board member; and to give founder and CEO Travis Kalanick three seats he had the right to designate. No one objected at the time; nor did they object any time in the next year. It was only after Mr. Kalanick took a leave to deal with his family’s personal tragedies that Benchmark for the first time took the position that Mr. Kalanick should be forced to resign and to give up his right to appoint additional Board members – supposedly because he had withheld information that Benchmark in fact knew all about.

 

There is no basis for canceling an agreement entered into by sophisticated investors each advised by counsel. We have a direct and substantial interest in not allowing the governance of the company to be unilaterally changed at the insistence of one party in violation of the procedures requiring written consent to amend. And there is no basis for Benchmark’s decision to ignore the comprehensive arbitration provision which governs all disputes arising out of that Agreement in favor of a high-profile filing that paints the company in a negative light to serve Benchmark’s own interest in a public campaign against the founder.

 

We are seeking to intervene in the lawsuit because if Benchmark insists on trying to use the courts to try to take over this company, we are committed to doing everything we can to try to stop this abuse.

 

We continue to hope that a way can be found for Benchmark to move forward, having profited so handsomely from the work of Travis Kalanick and many others, and to do so without inflicting gratuitous harm on the company which we have all supported, and for which we continue to have the greatest expectations.

 
Sincerely,

132,Tesla’s electric semi truck will reportedly get 200 to 300 miles per charge,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/24/teslas-electric-semi-truck-will-reportedly-get-200-to-300-miles-per-charge/,2017/08/24,"
Tesla’s already announced plans to reveal at an event in September an all-electric semi truck designed for cargo hauling, but we don’t know much about it beyond that yet. Now, Reuters reports that the vehicle will get between 200 and 300 miles of range per charge, which means it can manage medium-length routes without much issue.
As the report notes, this doesn’t put the Tesla semi in direct competition with long-haul fuel-powered rigs; those can go upwards of 1,000 miles on a single tank. But 300 miles is still long enough for a decent chunk of routes considered at the entry-level of the “long haul” category.
Tesla has said it’s working directly with potential customers and talking to them about their needs in developing the electric semi truck, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said he’s optimistic about their interest for what Tesla will ultimately reveal. The truck will also apparently feature self-driving capability, according to an earlier Reuters report. Tesla has met with state DMVs regarding potential tests of autonomous big rig technology.
Cost will be a huge deciding factor in how attractive the Tesla truck is as an option to commercial logistics companies. Batteries that could support that length of range for heavy loads would likely be extremely expensive, but Tesla will probably sell the idea on long-term savings in terms of maintenance requirements and fuel costs.
We’ll find out soon enough what the actual range is for the Tesla semi, as the plan still seems to be to unveil it fully in September. Self-driving could also help Tesla sell the idea, especially since it sounds like Musk anticipates at least a year or two until the vehicle enters production at scale.

133,Cubic Telecom gets $46.5M to connect cars and other devices globally,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/24/cubic-telecom-gets-46-5m-to-connect-cars-and-other-devices-globally/,2017/08/24,"
As automakers ramp up their connected car initiatives, a company that has built a solution to link vehicles up to mobile networks globally has raised a significant round of funding from a group of investors that includes Audi and Qualcomm.
Cubic Telecom, a startup out of Dublin, Ireland, that has built a virtual networking solution that lets cars (and other devices) automatically connect to service providers in whichever country they happen to be, has raised $46.5 million.
This round values Cubic Telecom at €180 million ($215 million), according to sources close to the company.
Barry Napier, Cubic’s CEO, said in an interview that the funding will be used to expand its team — today the team is 80 percent engineers and the company is planning to hire more — and to expand its solution into new markets, specifically China and the rest of Asia, and the US.
In addition to strategic investments from Audi and Qualcomm, this Series C round also includes backing from Valid Soluciones Tecnologicas SAU and Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), along with other unnamed investors.
If you have observed the world of tech and telecoms in Europe in the last several years, Cubic may be a familiar name to you. The company has been around since 2007, originally founded by Pat Phelan (who then went on to found an identity management company called Trustev, acquired by TransUnion).
It made a name for itself originally as a “virtual” mobile network provider that provided a solution for mobile users to make calls when travelling that didn’t cost an arm and a leg. (We also highlighted it back in the day at our first-ever Battlefield-style pitch event.)
In more recent years, though, roaming is something that regulators, carriers and app makers have worked on fixing for mobile consumers. In some regions you have roaming price caps; in others people buy “travel” packages ahead of their journeys; in other cases users simply opt to make calls via apps that bypass carrier call charges altogether.
And so Cubic has shifted its focus to other “hardware”, like cars, that have their own sets of hurdles when it comes to global connectivity.
As Napier describes it, typically when automakers manufacture connected cars, they have to arrange network agreements with carriers in each country where those cars are rolled out into the market. Each deal comes with its own SIM (similar to phones), and its own associated labor, time and operational cost.
Cubic’s proposal is to solve that with a software-based solution using an eSIM (working with Valid, another strategic investor) that is pre-loaded into the car at the point of manufacture.
Then, when the car is sold into one country or another, the car automatically links up to a local network to run its connected car services. That local network link-up is also part of Cubic’s offering: to date, it has mobile voice and data deals with 30 mobile operators covering over 180 countries.
“We are pleased to strengthen our partnership by participating in this latest funding round, said Dr. Peter Steiner, managing director Audi Electronics Venture GmbH, in a statement. “By utilizing Cubic’s technology we are able to offer seamless Audi connect services to our customers in many countries all over the world without roaming costs and volume limitation.”
The company has been working with Audi — which is part of the Volkswagen Group, one of the biggest car makers in the world that also owns brands like Porsche, SEAT and Skoda — for some time already, and Napier said it is on track to have its tech in some 1 million cars.
“Our ‘connected intelligence’ platform  has been growing between 23 percent to 25 percent every 55 days this year,” he said. “Our software has updated over 500,000 cars this year via OTA (over the Air) and we will hit over 1 million cars this year live.” In terms of active users, he said Cubic sees 600,000 unique automotive customers on its platform per month.
Other OEMs that Cubic works with point to how it is also positioning itself in the larger IoT trend. They include HP, Lenovo, Panasonic, Rakuten and Woolworth’s. And it’s building its connectivity also into processors from Qualcomm as part of that larger opportunity.
To date, Cubic has raised $83.5 million in funding.

134,"Uber’s financials show company is still growing, despite the drama",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/23/ubers-financials-show-company-is-still-growing-despite-the-drama/,2017/08/23,"
Uber’s past six months have been tumultuous, with lawsuits and allegations of harassment. The company doesn’t even have a CEO right now, but newly released financials suggest that most users don’t care.
First reported by Axios, Uber has confirmed to us that Uber’s $8.7 billion in gross bookings were up 17 percent in the second quarter. Global trips increased 150 percent year-over-year, excluding China.
Adjusted net revenue was $1.75 billion in the second quarter, up from $1.5 billion in the first quarter. Adjusted net losses also fell 9 percent to $645 million, a sign that margins are improving.
Uber is making it a habit of sharing its financials to send the message that the company is still doing well. But is it doing well enough? Uber’s $68.5 billion valuation already assumes rapid growth.
Several Uber investors have told us that the current consensus is Uber is now worth less than its last privately assigned valuation — a reflection, perhaps, of what brokers on the secondary market are seeing. According to an April report in The Information — published even before former CEO Travis Kalanick was asked to resign — investors were looking to buy Uber stock, and shareholders willing to sell it, at a $50 billion valuation, though it isn’t clear that Uber green-lighted any of those transactions.
It can’t help that Benchmark, an early investor with a board seat, has sued former CEO Kalanick, saying that Kalanick should have warned it about the company’s “material” problems.
Not everyone agrees the company’s value has slipped, however. Early investor Shervin Pishevar is offering to buy most of Benchmark Capital’s shares at the same price as the last private round.
Sources close to the firm have reportedly said it is not interested in selling to him.

135,Want to drive Elon Musk’s tunnel boring machine? Sell some Teslas,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/23/want-to-drive-elon-musks-tunnel-boring-machine-sell-some-teslas/,2017/08/23,"
Tesla’s referral program is a key ingredient to its brand success – it rewards owners for recruiting new buyers, with benefits like invitations to special events, including the recent Model 3 employee handover. Now, a new Level 2 bonus for people who recruit the most has been discovered by Teslarati: A chance to drive a Boring Company tunnel borer.
This is unlikely to be the thrill ride that you get from driving a P100D in Ludicrous Mode, for instance; Boring machines tend to crawl at very slow speeds, since they’re digging through pounds of dense material and also need to help make sure cave-ins don’t happen.
This reward comes with the promise of driving an electric tunnel boring matching at The Boring Company in Hawthorne, where SpaceX is, too. The Boring Co. has already begun work on its first tunnel, and even installed an elevator designed to lower cargo into its depths.
Again, this Boring Co. drive will probably actually be “boring,” and I’m not just saying that for the pun. But it’s still an undeniably cool opportunity, and a good carrot for the referral program.

136,Apple said to be prepping self-driving employee shuttle service,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/23/apple-said-to-be-prepping-self-driving-employee-shuttle-service/,2017/08/23,"
Apple’s first real-world use of some of the autonomous driving technology it’s working on could be a self-driving shuttle, according to a new report from The New York Times. The Times’ detailed progress (and some missteps) in Apple’s self-driving car ambitions, and one of those which still seems on track is a plan to create an autonomous shuttle to ferry employees from one part of its sprawling campus to another.
The report says Apple will use an existing commercial vehicle, equipped with autonomous tech it develops, to both offer service to employees and test its self-driving chops. This is not unlike what others in the autonomous vehicle space have done, including Waymo, and recently Cruise, which is offering its employees an autonomous on-demand ride hailing service that covers all of San Francisco.
Apple’s shuttle isn’t running just yet, according to this new report, but remains a plan the company intends to put in place. Apple’s new ‘spaceship’ campus in Cupertino is set to open soon, but it will still have offices peppered throughout the area and round-tripping employees who have meetings and commitments at various locations remains an actual business need, too.
Other companies are targeting exactly this kind of inter- and intra-campus fleet service as the low-hanging fruit of autonomy, and as a way to test technology and gather data in preparation for more ambitious and wide scale public service launches. Startup May Mobility, which I profiled just this week and which graduated from the most recent Y Combinator accelerator class, is specifically working on this, for example, because it’s a far more technically achievable goal in the near term.

137,LG to build U.S.-based factory for EV components in Michigan,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/lg-to-build-u-s-based-factory-for-ev-components-in-michigan/,2017/08/22,"
LG is building a new factory in Detroit suburb Hazel Park to supply electric vehicle components, the company announced on Tuesday. The facility will be a 250,000-square-foot manufacturing plant, and should result in almost 300 new jobs, LG says, with a $25 million price tag from the company and $2.9 million in grant money supplied by Michigan over the next four years.
LG’s EV components business is important to the electronics maker: during the first half of 2017, vehicle components were worth $1.5 billion in global revenue to LG, which is up 43 percent from last year. LG attributes a significant chunk of this growth to its partnership with GM in supplying components for the Bolt EV, Chevy’s low-cost long-range electric car.
Besides lithium-ion cells for the Bolt’s battery pack, LG also provides a number of other components, including the electric drive motor, the battery heater, the voltage distribution controller module, the infotainment system, the power inverter and much more. All of these are likely to be of interest to other automakers looking to build out their EV lineup, and a Michigan-based plant makes good strategic sense for filling that need.

138,Uber said to have considered automaker joint ventures for self-driving,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/uber-said-to-have-considered-automaker-joint-ventures-for-self-driving/,2017/08/22,"
Uber was reportedly approached by an unnamed automaker about a potential acquisition of its self-driving business, according to The Information. The idea was shot down by Uber execs, but the approach did prompt debate at the ride-hailing company around potentially partnering with an automaker on development of self-driving tech, possibly even through the formation of a joint venture.
Uber’s self-driving effort is housed under its Advanced Technology Group, which is based primarily in Pittsburgh and includes a staff heavy with Carnegie Mellon alumni and former students whose prior research was in the field of robotics and autonomous driving.
Self-driving is an area where Uber has so far sought to develop its own technology, though it uses vehicles from automakers including Volvo and Ford, along with sensor hardware from various component suppliers to test its sensor fusion and autonomous software systems. The company has piloted self-driving service trials in Pittsburgh and San Francisco, as well as Tempe, Arizona, but these are staffed by safety drivers and engineers and still include a lot of manual takeovers where the autonomous system is disengaged.
Uber also has been facing an ongoing legal battle with Alphabet’s Waymo regarding its self-driving program, and the company’s annual expenditures extend well into the billions, in part because it has taken on the significant challenge of developing self-driving technology on its own.
Rival Lyft has opted to mostly partner with companies focused on self-driving, in an effort to concentrate on the routing and ride-hailing aspects of potential future autonomous services. Uber also has announced a deal with Daimler around self-driving, but that’s focused on its open platform, which carmakers will be able to plug into with their own independently developed self-driving vehicles.
Last year, Uber was reported to be in talks with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles around some kind of partnership on self-driving, but much has changed at Uber in the interim, including its legal spat with Waymo and ongoing leadership overhaul.
The Information reports that no resolution of its potential plans around changes to its approach to self-driving are expected until after Uber secures a new CEO (the position is still vacant after founder Travis Kalanick’s much-publicized departure) and resolves its Waymo legal troubles.

139,Ford outlines plan to build self-driving cars at scale to deploy with partners,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/ford-outlines-plan-to-build-self-driving-cars-at-scale-to-deploy-with-partners/,2017/08/22,"
Ford’s autonomous driving vision includes fleet manufacturing, and then deploying vehicles at scale with partners working in commercial service areas like taxi and delivery. The core of this plan starts with building cars tailor-made to “improve the movement of people and goods,” according to Ford VP of Autonomous Vehicles and Electrification Sherif Markaby.
Marakby, freshly returned to Ford after a stint at Uber where he worked on the ride hailing company’s autonomous program, articulated Ford’s self-driving plan in broad strokes in a new Medium post on Tuesday. The resulting document is probably the most succinct and complete articulation of Ford’s autonomous vision thus far, which is noteworthy given that the automaker has previously announced plans to field an autonomous driving service launch by 2021.
Ford’s aiming to create a vehicle it can build at scale that not only is capable of autonomy, but that can also serve in both taxi and delivery businesses, and it says its existing experience working with enterprises in both those fields on fleet development and use-specific vehicle manufacturing will help it gain an edge in this regard.
Marakby notes that the focus will be on making sure the vehicles it brings to market for this task will be designed specifically to be able to maximize utilization time, which means boosting the time they can spend on the road between refuelings. To that end, they’re looking at hybrid-electrics out of the gate, since Ford has ample experience in that area and it’s the best compromise in terms of available tech and maximum range.
The post also says that Ford’s Palo Alto-based Greenfield Labs is looking to make sure that the vehicle design is “human-centric,” which is to say that they’re talking with their potential service deployment partners to find out what makes the most sense in terms of adding capabilities and features that can give vehicles advantages over current human-driven ones in terms of performing their desired function, whether it be moving people or goods.
Ford’s plan is to start with autonomous fleet services, and these will likely operate in very specific, limited areas with high demand and extensive, detailed route mapping. The details of the final vehicle are of definite interest, so here’s hoping they’re ready to reveal more about the car they plan to build at scale soon.

140,Ford set to create a new joint venture to produce EVs in China,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/22/ford-set-to-create-a-new-joint-venture-to-produce-evs-in-china/,2017/08/22,"
Automaker Ford will team up with local partner Anhui Zotye Automobile to create a new joint venture in China aimed specifically at producing electric cars. The deal will see Ford and its new partner sell the vehicle sunder a local brand, rather than with its “Ford” name, and ultimately its aim is to produce even more electric vehicles for a market where there is strong incentive to bring EVs to consumers.
This is the third joint venture Ford has set up with local Chinese automakers. It’s standard practice for foreign car companies to partner with local Chinese vehicle producers, as a way to avoid having to pay very high import taxes on vehicles made by exclusively foreign-controlled concerns.
Ford has two JVs set up with other automakers including Changan Automobile and Jiangling Motors, and normally that’s the upper limit for joint ventures allowed by Chinese industry regulators. Recently, however, Beijing added an allotment for a third joint deal, provided its focus is specifically electric vehicle manufacture.
China is doing a lot to boost electric car adoption in the country, including adjusting the rules for automakers in terms of how much of their total output must be EVs. Zotye, Ford’s new partner, is an electric car specialist, with a total of 16,000 EV sales so far in 2017. Overall, Ford is aiming to make sure that 70 percent of the cars its offers in China are electric vehicles by 2025.
Ford’s not alone in building new JVs in China focused specifically on electric: Volkswagen announced plans to create its own third venture with a Chinese partner earlier this year, with production to begin in 2018.

141,May Mobility is a self-driving startup with a decade of experience,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/21/may-mobility-is-a-self-driving-startup-with-a-decade-of-experience/,2017/08/21,"
May Mobility is a startup making its official debut at Y Combinator’s demo day on Monday, focused on offering autonomous driving technology that companies with commercial fleets will be able to use in the near-term, not a decade from now. But the startup, while young, actually has a decade of experience, thanks to a team that’s been working on autonomous tech since the third DARPA Grand Challenge in 2007.
May Mobility is led by CEO and co-founder Edwin Olson, who used to act as lead investigator on Ford’s autonomous driving program. Olson was also a co-director focused on autonomous driving at Toyota Research Institute, which houses some of the top minds in the world in robotics, and is taking a leave from his current role as an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of Michigan to build May.
Olson’s co-founder and May COO Alisyn Malek also have a very impressive history in autonomy, having previously worked at GM Ventures, where she oversaw the relationship with then-startup Cruise Automation, which was subsequently acquired by GM and brought in-house to help develop that automaker’s internal self-driving technology. Malek is no stranger to startups pitching AV tech and products, which makes her decision to join May all the more an endorsement.

May’s Chief Technical Officer Steve Vozar is also a former member of Ford’s autonomous vehicle program, and used to oversee University of Michigan’s APRIL robotics laboratory, which focused a lot of its effort on self-driving cars. Meanwhile, many of Olson’s graduate researchers, who also did work at APRIL, are joining the startup, too.
The team behind the startup may be stacked with academic expertise, but its aims are very focused on practical, real-world implementations of autonomous driving technology, with a specific emphasis on what’s possible today, not what might be doable five or ten years from now. That means aiming at customers that have vehicle needs in business districts, on campuses (school and corporate) or in closed residential communities, where routes are more easily mapped and conditions are relatively predictable.
“We’ve seen the Ford, Toyota and GM experiences up close,” Olson said, explaining why May’s approach is different. “Like the other big companies in this space, Waymo, Zoox and other OEM, they’re all after the transportation market as a whole. This is the $4 trillion problem of transportation on demand, think autonomous Uber. That’s a great problem, that’s a great market; but we believe the technological path there is going to be many years more, five to ten years at least. And in the meantime, we think that by getting out in to the real world we can not only build a successful business, but we can turn on a flow of data and operational know-how that will help us move and improve our systems faster than the OEMs which are in R&D mode.”

To accomplish this, May has created a comprehensive autonomous vehicle technology stack, its sixth major stack overall across the core team. For potential customers, this can be installed in vehicle fleets to offer autonomy to their transportation options. May doesn’t make the vehicles, but it works with existing vehicle platforms designed for this kind of fleet service, and the installations go way deeper than just a May simple aftermarket add-on.
The company also differentiates itself by offering full fleet operation service. May wants to do everything from daily operation to maintenance and cleaning, making it a true full-service vertical service provider for anyone looking to implement autonomous shuttle service.
Just how soon can they make this happen? May Mobility is aiming to spin up long-term operations with its first clients sometime in 2018, which is fast given that it only began as a company earlier this year. May is also currently in talks to potentially spin up as many as four pilots between now and February, with areas that cover both public and private roadways.
So far, May has raised around $3.5 million, from investors including Maven, Trucks, and Tandem. The goal is to raise more during the course of the next year in order to help with hiring and operational growth.

142,Volkswagen’s electric Microbus successor set to go on sale in 2022,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/21/volkswagens-electric-microbus-successor-set-to-go-on-sale-in-2022/,2017/08/21,"
The VW Microbus is about as iconic as they come in the world of automobiles, and the I.D. Buzz is the electric, modern incarnation of that van Volkswagen introduced as a concept back in January. In June, the automaker surprised many by announcing the I.D. Buzz would eventually become a production vehicle, instead of just another concept destined to fade away in the mists of time.
Now, Volkswagen is confirming a sale date for the I.D. Buzz – 2022, via Roadshow, who got to spend some time tooling around in a functional concept prototype of the two-tone beach companion. That’s still quite a ways off, and a lot can happen between now and then, but it’s still going to give plenty of Microbus fans hoping for a modern, green version of the roadtrip standout they can actually buy.

The I.D. Buzz has about 270 miles of range on its battery pack, which is a lot of miles between charges for those cross-country trips. VW also says it could manage to get around 369 horsepower out of its all-wheel drive motor system, which is a far cry from the original’s meek 25 HP or so. But the car isn’t about speed, really – its standout features include a reconfigurable interior that’s designed around planned autonomous capabilities.
The driver seat in the van can swivel all the way around for family card games, and the back seat configurations include the ability to clear out a middle row for ample stretching, leg and cargo space. It’s also got a nearly full length glass top for watching the stars while you recline in the back and let the Buzz drive itself.
Basically this is the car of my dreams, since anyone who knows me will tell you I love stupid boxy automobiles with an abundance of utilitarian interior space above almost all else. I also love EVs, and the fun they provide while driving, so it’ll be basically impossible to tear me away from this thing once it launches.

143,Cloud driver profiles mean any Tesla could automatically become your Tesla,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/21/cloud-driver-profiles-mean-any-tesla-could-automatically-become-your-tesla/,2017/08/21,"
Tesla has a plan to move its personalized driver profiles, which track things like seat and steering wheel position, to the cloud. This would mean Tesla drivers can download to them to theoretically any connected Tesla vehicle and have all their driver preferences in place, including regenerative braking, temperature units, map settings and more.
Tesla CEO and founder Elon Musk tweeted the news about server-stored profiles in response to a question from a Tesla owner, which actually wasn’t specifically asking about driver preferences that follow you across vehicles.
Musk noted that Tesla’s plan was to move “all info and settings” to cloud-based storage, so that “any Tesla you drive in the world automatically adjusts to you.” I remember when driver profiles specific to vehicles were introduced – it was like a revelation. Being able to have that same experience even when you’re popping into a rental car, a friend’s vehicle, or a Tesla connected to a future brand-wide opt-in ride sharing service would be amazing.
Tesla’s also setting the stage here for something that will likely become even more important to automakers in general in the future: A persistent, data-rich profile of a user that extends over time, much like a Google account. The auto industry seems bound to evolve to place more emphasis on shared services in place of traditional ownership, and that kind of customer relationship will be key as we move towards that.
Tesla is arguably already best-positioned to build those kinds of lifetime customer bonds, but features like cloud profiles could help deepen the connection, giving the carmaker an advantage that can’t be matched by technical innovation alone.

The “Ludicrous” Teslas are ludicrous indeed.
And this video posted to YouTube by DragTimes is just the latest in a series of evidentiary exhibits that proves it.
In the video, a Tesla Model X P100D crossover SUV is pitted against a $530,000 Lamborghini Aventador. Spoiler alert: the Tesla beats it by .05 of a second, leaving the Lambo crying “Mercy”.
At 5,4000 pounds, the Tesla is no lightweight, and the Aventador is a good 1,200 pounds lighter. But the Ludicrous + enabled vehicle not only beats the Lambo, it sets a world record for the quickest SUV with a quarter mile time clocking in at 11.418 seconds at nearly 118 miles-per-hour.
It’s just another ludicrous day out at the racetrack for the Tesla, which was put through its paces at the the Palm Beach International Raceway.

145,Former GE CEO Jeff Immelt close to becoming Uber’s CEO,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/19/former-ge-ceo-jeff-immelt-close-to-becoming-ubers-ceo/,2017/08/19,"
The long and dramatic process for naming a new Uber CEO may be coming closer to an end.
First reported by Kara Swisher, our sources are also telling us that former General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt is still being seriously considered and the board vote is expected to happen soon. The talks were first reported several weeks ago.
Co-founder and CEO Travis Kalanick was asked to resign in June, following the completion of an investigation into the company’s culture. A lawsuit with Waymo and accusations of a sexist company culture are partly what led to his departure.
But Kalanick still remains on the board and has the power to appoint two more board seats, which has become the subject of a lawsuit with early investor, Benchmark Capital. Benchmark wants Kalanick off the board because it believes that he didn’t disclose material information about the legal and ethical problems at the company. In response, Kalanick ally and investor Shervin Pishevar suggested that Benchmark’s Matt Cohler should be taken off the board. Kalanick has weighed in, saying that Benchmark took advantage of him when they persuaded him to step down from Uber, while he was mourning his mother’s recent death. 
The stakes are especially high because Uber’s $68.5 billion valuation is just paper money until there is an exit, likely via IPO or acquisition. Kalanick has reportedly been telling people that he wants to return to the CEO.
Uber investors have mixed feelings about Immelt. One investor who asked to be anonymous felt that Immelt had the right disposition to bring the company back in the right direction. Another expressed concern about Immelt’s lack of industry expertise and seemed to feel that he’s not someone the company would have wanted, had it not been in this difficult situation.
But while Immelt is said to be the frontrunner, this is not a done deal. With all the board drama, it may be hard to finalize things.
Swisher reported that the board vote is expected to happen within two weeks. We’re hearing it might be sooner.

147,Fisker’s EMotion Tesla competitor will make its official debut at CES 2018,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/18/fiskers-emotion-tesla-competitor-will-make-its-official-debut-at-ces-2018/,2017/08/18,"
The first car from Henrik Fisker’s new electric vehicle company, the EMotion luxury sport sedan, will premiere at CES in January 2018. That’s according to Fisker himself, who shared the debut date with TheStreet on Friday.
We already know what the EMotion looks like, as well as its $129,000 starting price tag, and some of the technical achievements it’s said to pack, like 400 miles of range and eventual Level 4 autonomy. We also know that people won’t be able to actually get their hands on one until 2019, despite Fisker Inc. having opened pre-orders earlier this year.
This is the legendary car designer’s second crack at building a viable EV company – his first attempt, Fisker Automotive, led to a bankruptcy filing and then a subsequent sell-off to China’s Wanxiang Group, which renamed it Karma and has since debuted its Revero (which looks a lot like Fisker Automotive’s original Karma car – it’s confusing, I know).
While we also know about the new Fisker Inc. car’s carbon-fiber and aluminum construction, built-in LiDAR in the front and 9 minute, 125 mile charging capacity, there are still plenty of question marks, including about underlying tech, the promised autonomy, go-to-market strategy, and more. Plus, while we’ve seen pictures and even video of the vehicle, it’s still not made a proper in-the-flesh appearance for the public.

CES is also now the default venue for big splash reveals of new electric vehicles that have at least a decent chance of never making it to market: Last year, Faraday Future had one of the splashiest I’ve ever attended at a huge rented out warehouse in Las Vegas during the annual consumer electronics expo.

Automotive supply giant Delphi, which recently shifted focus to target autonomous and high-tech solutions more specifically, has signed a new partnership with Innoviz, an Israeli tech company building LiDAR tech for autonomous driving. The team-up includes a new minority investment from Delphi in Innoviz, the full financial details of which haven’t been released.
The commercial partnership with Innoviz includes integration of the latter’s LiDAR sensors into Delphi’s autonomous systems, with the intend of offering a mass commercial offering to the automotive industry that can provide SAE Level 3 and Level 4 self-driving capabilities.
LiDAR’s a key ingredient in most self-driving setups, since it provides extremely accurate, high-detail 3D depth maps of a vehicle’s surroundings. Innoviz has been focused on creating LiDAR that takes up less space than existing solutions, while also coming in at more reasonable price points. Currently shipping industry-leading solutions from other LiDAR suppliers like Velodyne are prohibitively expensive for inclusion in consumer vehicles.
Innoviz has revealed a solid-state LiDAR design it hopes to bring to vehicles as a production sample by early 2019, and it revealed a developer aftermarket version that it’ll ship earlier called InnovizPro to help automakers prepare for its inclusion. Global supplier Magna is also planning on using Innoviz LiDAR in its own autonomous driving systems, the company announced late last year.

Days of thunder future past? Infiniti’s newest race car prototype is actually inspired by vintage race vehicles of the 1940s, with a torpedo-style sleek cylindrical body and offset wheels at the end of extended axes. The drivetrain of the so-called ‘Prototype 9,’ however, is all 2017: It’s an electric motor, combined with a 30 kWh battery pack.
Here’s what I like about this car: It’s very cool looking. Also it has the equivalent of 148 hp and 236 lb ft of torque, with a top speed of 105 mph and a 0-60 mph time of 5.5 seconds. It can run for 20 minutes of aggressive track racing on that battery pack with a full charge, and the hammer-head look of the front end with the exaggerated grill is a damn nice piece of industrial design.

Nissan’s motor department built the engine, which is a prototype not yet used on any kind of production car. It seems mostly made for showing off at the super-fancy Concours D’Elegance, which is some kind of highfalutin car show at Pebble Beach golf course.
Another interesting thing about the Prototype 9 is that it uses steel throughout, from frame to body panels. This is again more of a throwback, especially for an EV, since most modern electric cars favor lighter materials like aluminum to help lower overall body weight and aim for more range.
The car is also completely silent, which is unusual for a race car but not for an EV. Infinity says its design was inspired by Japanese archers, and the silent, speedy arrows that they let loose from their bows.

Apple’s iOS 11 includes ARKit, developer tools that make it surprisingly easy to build great quality augmented reality experiences. This could have an impact in the automotive world, since it makes it a lot easier to bring virtual showroom experiences to potential car buyers and automakers via ordinary consumer devices.
Here’s an example of what that could look like: Developer Augmently created this AR experience using the developer preview ARKit tools in iOS 11. It features a detailed, rendered 3D model of a Mercedes sedan, complete with an interactive interior and the ability to swap out different paint color options. The model stays firmly rooted in place, allowing a user to virtually walk around it and check out all angles.

Virtual showrooms and AR demonstrations are now standard fare for automakers at big auto shows, and even in dealership settings sometimes with specialized hardware. But this use of ARKit brings it down to Earth – it’s instantly available to anyone with an iPhone.
Car sales models are already being shaken up by startups – Tesla sells its vehicles exclusively online, using showrooms only for in-person looks at its cars. Online car-buying startups are increasingly attempting to complement and supplant the existing brick-and-mortar sales model, too, and even Amazon has experimented with online sales, particularly in Europe.
ARKit replaces a lot of kludgy, hard-to-use and less-than-perfect solutions for doing similar things, but it’s the system-level tools and quality of experience that could help it up the game for automobile sales, demonstrations and showrooming. AR isn’t the only thing ARKit could make mainstream – online vehicle sales could benefit big time, too.

151,Nvidia invests in Chinese autonomous trucking startup TuSimple,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/16/nvidia-invests-in-chinese-autonomous-trucking-startup-tusimple/,2017/08/16,"
Nvidia has invested in TuSimple, the graphics card maker revealed today. It’s investing in a $20 million round led by Sina, the Chinese check giant behind Weibo, and it’s also providing TuSimple with Nvidia tech to power its self-driving platform, including NVIDIA GPUs, its Drive PX 2 autonomous computer, Jetson TX2 and more.
TuSimple has already run an SAE Level 4 (true self-driving) test ride between San Diego, California and Yuma, Arizona. That took place in June, spanning 200 miles and using camera data primarily to navigate the highway route. The startup has research and development facilities in both Beijing and San Diego, and more than 100 employees.
The tech used by TuSimple includes extensive HD mapping of the routes driven, as well as three millimeter-wave radar units, in addition to the camera data from eight cameras and the resulting computer vision processing it does. TuSimple says that it can achieve “centimeter-level” accuracy for truck positioning, even when driving inside a tunnel, and its in-house decision-making machine intelligence makes for safe route navigation.
The company’s also developing a car identification tool using its image recognition software. They note that once available, it’ll be able to identify car make and model with 97 percent accuracy from photos of vehicles uploaded to its site. This is an interesting additional use of its image processing chops, and could present additional revenue opportunities once its self-driving trucks are on roads capturing images of other vehicles on the road while en route.

The joint effort by Mobileye, Intel and BMW to develop an autonomous driving platform that can be used by other automakers has a new partner: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA). FCA and the group signed a memorandum of understanding to work together, which opens the door for FCA to contribute to the progress the team has already made.
Already, BMW, Intel and Mobileye (which Intel subsequently acquired) have been working on building the platform, which is designed to be scalable from SAE Level 3 to full, Level 4 and 5 self-driving. The aim is to field a viable platform for commercial deployment by 2021, and progress to date includes putting 40 self-driving test cars on the road by the end of the year.
The partnership also revealed today that it expects to make use of the 100 planed Level 4 autonomous test cars Intel and Mobileye announced they’d be deploying separately upon the closure of Intel’s acquisition of the Israeli tech company.
FCA’s contribution to the group effort will be to add additional engineering and technical resources to the mix, and to act as a vector for the eventual resulting self-driving platform. A press release announcing the news cites FCA’s “significant sales volumes, geographic reach and long-time experience in North America” as key assets it brings to the overall mix.
The race to consumer self-driving remains a game of musical chairs for the moment, and players aren’t remaining strictly committed to any one partner. This FCA development is significant, however, if the BMW/Intel tie-up hopes to help achieve critical mass as a viable option for other global automakers considering their options.

153,Benchmark: We should have sued Kalanick sooner,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/14/benchmark-we-should-have-sued-kalanick-sooner/,2017/08/14,"
The saga between the powerhouse venture firm Benchmark  and former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick continues. Following last week’s lawsuit revelation, Benchmark penned a public letter to Uber employees explaining why it is taking legal action against Kalanick, who remains on Uber’s board and controls two other, empty board seats.
Today, Benchmark doubled down on its decision, writing a note addressed to Uber employees, saying that not only should it sue, but “perhaps the better question is why didn’t we act sooner.” The firm said that when the CEO search began more than 50 days ago, Kalanick agreed in writing to “modify the company’s voting agreement to ensure that the board was composed of independent, diverse, and well qualified directors.” Benchmark is alleging that Kalanick has not followed through on this agreement and that he was warned more than a month ago that he would be subject to potential litigation.
The lawsuit and Kalanick’s resignation have been controversial in Silicon Valley. The former Uber CEO resigned in June amid board pressure, following months of turmoil at the most valuable startup. Allegations of sexual harassment, discrimination and law-breaking led to a company investigation by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.
Benchmark claims it was necessary for Kalanick to step down. “We acted out of a deep conviction that it would be better for Uber, its employees, and investors to have a fresh start. We believed then, as we believe now, that failing to act would have meant endorsing behavior that was utterly unacceptable in any company, let alone a company of Uber’s size and importance.”
Through a spokesperson, Kalanick responded to the Benchmark letter. “Like many shareholders, I am disappointed and baffled by Benchmark’s hostile actions, which clearly are not in the best interests of Uber and its employees on whose behalf they claim to be acting. Since 2009, building Uber into a great company has been my passion and obsession. I continue to work tirelessly with the board to identify and hire the best CEO to guide Uber into its next phase of growth and ensure its continued success.”
It’s true that not all of Uber’s investors are in agreement that Kalanick should be sued and pushed off the board. Sherpa Capital, founded by early Uber investor Shervin Pishevar, has come out against Benchmark, demanding that it should be the one to leave the board and should also sell most of its shares. 
There have been several other proposed scenarios. First reported by The New York Times, we’ve confirmed that Dragoneer Investment Group has discussed leading a coalition to buy some of Uber’s shares at a discount and would also buy some new shares at the $68.5 billion valuation the company was assigned during its last private round of funding to maintain that valuation. No formal offer has been made, but the Uber board has agreed to move forward with the discussion.
There have also been various reports about SoftBank and the possibility of the Japanese investment firm buying up shares.

154,The new DeLorean is all about flying cars,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/14/the-new-delorean-is-all-about-flying-cars/,2017/08/14,"
The DeLorean name is iconic thanks largely to Back to the Future, in which one of the original automaker’s cars was turned into a time machine by ‘Doc’ Emmett Brown. Now, the original DeLorean founder’s nephew is working on making flying cars a reality, with his own aerospace company.
Paul DeLorean’s DeLorean aerospace isn’t actually aiming to exactly replicate the scene from Back to the Future in which the time machine takes off as an airborne vehicle. But it is trying to create a vertical take-off and landing craft (VTOL) that would be able to operate in a roughly similar manner, and it’s hoping to have a full-sized prototype ready within a year’s time, according to Wired.

DeLorean’s first aircraft is called the DR-7 VTOL, and it looks like something out of a much more modern sci-fi film. There are two turbines for propulsion, as well as a two-seat cockpit about mid-body. The plan is to make it a fully electric vehicle, and DeLorean has already completed two small-scale models, including a one-third scale engineering model.
Eventually, the hope is to build a final piloted craft that can travel for 120 miles on a full charge, with a body length of 20 feet and a width of 18.5 across the sides stretch of its wingspan. The range is the biggest challenge and its potential standout point among the competition, given that other prototype designs have much shorter projected ranges.

155,"Toyota, Intel and others form big data group for automotive tech",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/11/toyota-intel-automotive-big-data/,2017/08/11,"
A collection of prominent names in the tech industry have teamed up with Toyota to work on developing big data systems to support self-driving cars and other future automotive advances.
Denso, Ericsson, Intel and NTT Docomo joined hands with the Japanese car giant to announce the Automotive Edge Computing Consortium today. The group said it has plans to add “relevant global technology leaders” to its membership this year.
The companies have come together to tackle concerns around data usage in connected cars of the future, a critical component to making real-time mapping, driving assistance and other services go from theory to working in practice. Handling the huge volumes of data in a reliable and secure manner is critical.
“It is estimated that the data volume between vehicles and the cloud will reach 10 exabytes per month around 2025, approximately 10,000 times larger than the present volume. This expected increase will trigger the need for new architectures of network and computing infrastructure to support distributed resources and topology-aware storage capacity,” the group said in a statement.
To give an idea of scale, 10 exabytes is 10 billion gigabytes — a lot of data indeed.
Toyota has been pretty busy in the connected car space, to say the least. Last week, it took a stake in Mazda to advance its AI and autonomous tech push, and other notable advancements this year have included a connected car partnership with NTT, a move into the blockchain, and a $100 million fund to invest in AI startups.

156,Indian startup Flux Auto wants to democratize self-driving tech for trucks,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/10/flux-auto/,2017/08/10,"
A young startup in India wants to makes autonomous driving technology more widely available for truck operators, especially those outside of the U.S., by lower the cost significantly.
The concept of self-driving trucks sat in the background for some time as the vision of autonomous cars ferrying consumers from A to B hogged the limelight, but the potential for trucking is at least on par if not higher — particularly on a global level. Beyond potential safety gains, integrating elements of autonomous car tech can help boost efficiency, too.
Thus far the technology has been pioneered in Silicon Valley, where giants like Uber and Google are working on bringing the tech into trucks — via their Otto (now Uber ATG) and Waymo business units, respectively — while Tesla is preparing to enter to foray. All these solutions require expensive kit that isn’t deployable on all vehicles. That combination means it is likely to be out of reach for most of the world’s trucking community once it is finally available on a commercial basis.
That’s where Flux Auto, a 16-person startup based in Bangalore, hopes to make a difference by democratizing autonomous systems. It is developing technology that, when finished, could enable any kind of truck to be retrofitted with self-driving car technology at a far lower price.
To make its tech accessible, Flux Auto has had to make a compromise. It doesn’t use Lidar — Light Detection and Ranging — sensors which have become the standard for autonomous vehicles, but are incredible expensive. Waymo CEO John Krafcik recently revealed a Lidar would cost $75,000 a few years ago, but these days he claims it is just 10 percent of that price. Even still, at $7,500 it remains prohibitively costly for many truck operates — and that’s just one component.
“While the competition is focusing on LIDAR technology which is very expensive and processing heavy (due to a lot of unneeded data), our vision algorithms can be used with any cheap cameras and has a much quicker response time. This drives down our cost and in turn, the cost for the customer as well, all while having similar levels of accuracy as a LIDAR system,” Flux Auto founder Pranav Manpuria explained to TechCrunch.

Uber ATG’s trucks use a Lidar mounted above the cab
Flux Auto is looking at a product that would retail for around $3,000-$4,500, the price range would be dependent on the level of features a customer wants.
The system is being developed to handle cruise control, lane keeping and collision avoidance. Like Uber AG and Waymo, the idea is to take the strain off of drivers and help make journeys more efficient.
“We’re using cameras along with other sensors — sonar, radar, ultrasonic, etc — to understand everything that’s happening around the vehicle, and make decisions based on that,” Manpuria said. “We’re developing our entire tech stack as an after market accessory. This allows us to target the massive market of already existing commercial vehicles.”

Flux Auto’s Lidar-less test truck
Manpuria, who graduated from the Illinois Institute of Technology and previously ran a payment startup, said the company is looking to raise around $1.5 million to fulfill its goal of deploying its systems on trucks in a range of markets beyond India. Initially it began testing on cars, but it has just equipped its first truck (see above) for the next stage of testing before the end of this month.
Money from investors will go towards expanding the team and developing its technology. Flux Auto is aiming to deploy its tech on 2,500 vehicles within the next twelve months. That’s likely to necessitate a U.S. office, and Manpuria said the business may need to migrate to the U.S. to continue its development in the future. That’s particularly true if India bans autonomous cars, as its transport minister has threatened.
“I’ve been very interested in self-driving and it’s benefits for a while now. However, working on a self driving car didn’t seem appealing since car owners would be reluctant to spend a few thousand dollars on technology where the benefits to them aren’t that obvious,” he said.
“Where this technology makes the most sense, and can have the biggest impact is the trucking industry — and the benefits we provide with our technology are worth an investment into it by truck owners,” said Manpuria.

GM’s Maven car sharing company is expanding its Gig service across the U.S., with six new major urban markets to be added to the locations where the short-term rental service aimed at gig economy workers is available. Those include L.A., where it’s going live today, as well as Boston, Phoenix, and Washington, D.C. this fall, with Baltimore and Detroit to be added some time after that.
Maven Gig offers cars from its fleet of GM vehicles on a weekly basis, with no longer-term commitments required. Gig rolls in insurance (minus the deductible), unlimited miles and regular maintenance for one flat weekly fee, which start at $180 per week plus tax for vehicles like the Chevrolet Cruze.
The idea is that the freelance driving economy, including ride hailing as well as activities like grocery and package delivery, all require people to have readily available vehicles. Gig economy workers are often occasional, however, and work when they need to boost their spending but not necessarily on a consistent basis that would be best served by them owning their own vehicle.
The new expansion also brings in a new official partner, HopSkipDrive, which is a ride sharing service designed for getting kids around town with additional screening processes for drivers and real-time monitoring. Other official partners including GrubHub, Instacart, Roadie and more, though Gig can be used for any freelance workers looking for a vehicle on a limited term basis.
Maven says Gig drivers have already driven over 170 million miles since the service began in 2016, with the Bolt EV (Gig’s most popular rental option) having driven 1.4 million all-electric miles in California since February, 2017. Maven says Gig drivers average 30 percent more miles per day than those using traditional engine vehicles.

Mezrahi, who’s been in charge of social media strategy at BuzzFeed and The Dodo, now runs Kale Salad, a Twitter account that finds and shares original tweets and photos stolen by meme accounts. While at BuzzFeed, Mezrahi wrote about his own run-in with Apple Music’s automobile auto-playing quirk, which auditorially ambushed him with “A-Team” by Vampire Weekend every time he plugged his iPhone into his car. His article was posted back in May 2016, so even though this issue is relatively minor in the scheme of recent developments like the threat of nuclear war, it’s been preventing Apple Music users from living their best life for quite a while.
There are different (irritatingly complicated) things you can try to turn off the feature, but in the meantime, you can save your sanity and help Mezrahi realize his childhood dream at the same time:

It’s my dream ever since I was a little boy in 1987 to trend on iTunes and have the number one song, please help me make that happen. https://t.co/23SlQgbaAC

159,Tesla said to be working on self-driving tech for electric semi truck,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/09/tesla-said-to-be-working-on-self-driving-tech-for-electric-semi-truck/,2017/08/09,"
Tesla is working on self-driving technology specifically tied to its forthcoming electric semi-truck plans, according to a Reuters report. The tech would allow the transport trucks to move in convoy formation with a lead vehicle providing guidance for autonomous follow trucks, according to emails discovered by Reuters in which Tesla discusses the work with the Nevada DMV.
Tesla is also set to meet with the California DMV to discuss autonomous trucking technology, according to comments made by that organization to Reuters. Tesla has already confirmed that it is working on an all-electric semi truck, set to be revealed in more detail at a planned event teased by Elon Musk to take place in September.
This is relatively familiar territory for any company making serious investment in self-driving tech: Uber acquired Otto, a company founded by former Google self-driving car team members dedicated to autonomous trucking, and it continues that work under its Advanced Technologies Group. Waymo, the Alphabet company created from the Google self-driving car project, has also recently revealed that it also is in the early stages of creating autonomous truck tech.
While neither Tesla nor Elon Musk has mentioned autonomy in relation to their electric transport truck plans, the automaker’s CEO has discussed potential surprises to be revealed alongside the big rig this fall. It’s also been working a lot on Autopilot improvements, something Musk said during his most recent Tesla earnings call that he himself spends a lot of time on.
Platooning could mean that the autonomy requirements aren’t much more technically advanced that those found in current Autopilot systems for consumer Tesla vehicles. A lead vehicle with a human driver could be used, with autonomous follow vehicles that cut down on the total need for drivers and increase overall efficiency.
Tesla reportedly wanted to meet with Nevada to discuss the testing of two prototype trucks, so it sounds like the project is quite far along. The automaker hasn’t yet applied for a license to test the vehicles, however, so that could be coming later, once the trucks themselves are a known quantity revealed to the public.

160,Intel to build a fleet of over 100 self-driving test cars starting later this year,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/09/intel-to-build-a-fleet-of-over-100-self-driving-test-cars-starting-later-this-year/,2017/08/09,"
Intel is moving quickly to ramp its autonomous driving technology efforts now that it has closed its acquisition of Mobileye, the Israeli self-driving sensor and computing company. The plan is to build a fleet of over 100 test vehicles with SAE Level 4 capabilities (fully self-driving) with the first of those hitting roads later this year.
The test fleet is designed to show off Intel and Mobileye’s hybrid autonomous driving software system, which it hopes to offer as an industry supplier for a range of different applications and uses. The test fleet will accordingly include different vehicle brands and types, the company says, to help show that the platform itself is open for use in basically any applications.
Intel’s test fleet is going to be a sales tool for the company for potential partners and customers, but the company says it’ll also be used for safety validation and for working with regulators on meeting transportation rule requirements. Data collection from the fleet will help with that, as well as with improving the technology over time.
Testing with the vehicles will be conducted in the U.S., Mobileye’s home country of Israel, and in other parts of Europe. Other companies including Waymo and GM’s Cruise also maintain active test fleets for autonomous vehicles, and if Intel’s serious about being a primary player in this market, maintaining its own fleet is basically table stakes at this stage. The company opened an Autonomous Driving Garage in San Jose in May, and that will likely figure as a key center of operations for managing this new vehicle fleet.

Hyundai is working with the South Korean government to use the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics as a demonstration event for the automakers self-driving tech. The conditions will be challenging, however, since the roads will be winding and with significant grades, and the hope at least is that there will be plenty of snow – a notorious enemy of sensors used in self-driving tech. Hyundai will use HD maps to overcome these challenges, according to Korea’s etnews.
The maps used for the self-driving deployment will have resolution with less than 10 cm margin of error, which is the “world’s best” according to the company when it comes to these kinds of HD maps. It’ll help supplement the on-vehicle sensors, and the mapping itself is being done by Hyundai’s MNsoft subsicdiatiry, which is using LiDAR and radar to build a high-resolution point cloud of the area, which is supplemented by images captured by 4 cameras at a rate of 200 pictures per second.
Hyundai demonstrated its HD mapping tech this year at CES, using Ioniq hybrid cars that were meant to show how the automaker could bring autonomous tech to market with a vehicle that has fewer specialized sensors and could therefore be made affordably for everyday consumers.
The Olympics are shaping up to be a key demonstration event for forthcoming autonomous vehicle tech: Hyundai plans to show of its SAE Level 4 capabilities next year in Pyeongchang, and Toyota is also set to show off its own autonomous cars during the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan.

162,"Uber considering options for Xchange Leasing, including sell-off",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/08/uber-considering-options-for-xchange-leasing-including-sell-off/,2017/08/08,"
Uber is considering its options regarding what to do with its Xchange Leasing program for providing subprime car leases to drivers on its service, according to a source familiar with the program. The Wall Street Journal reported that it planned to close the operation earlier on Tuesday, and we’ve confirmed that it’s looking at a number of options for how to proceed, including an outright sale of the business to outside parties.
Uber and its board decided that Xchange was in need of significant changes given its current operating realities, and the WSJ report claims that it is causing “unsustainably high losses” for Uber. The Xchange program was introduced by Uber two years ago as a way to help provide vehicles to potential drivers who couldn’t necessarily secure one through more traditional means.
Our source says that Uber still wants to ensure vehicles have a cost-effective way to secure vehicles, but says the company also realizes it has to be done in a way that is sustainable from a financial standpoint. This is similar in motivation to Uber’s deals with Didi and Yandex in terms of finding a strategic way to stem outbound cash flow, the source claims.
As mentioned, an outright sale of the leasing operation is one possible outcome, and outside parties have already shown interest in such a sale according to our source. It could also involve scaling back the geographic footprint of Xchange to just a few of the cities where Uber operates. The options on the table could involve layoffs, but might also involve bringing Xchange employees in-house to fill vacancies at Uber proper.
Uber has also partnered with external companies for short-term rental and leasing options for cars used to ferry passengers, and it sounds like offloading its own ownership of these vehicles is the preferred path, in order to defray the cost requirements that come with owning and operating a fleet.

164,"With $5.3 million in funding, CarDash wants to change how you get your car serviced",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/08/cardash-5-3-million/,2017/08/08,"
For car owners, getting their vehicle repaired or even dealing with routine maintenance can be a pain. Launching today, a company called CarDash wants to make auto service less painful and more transparent.
Available initially in the Bay Area, CarDash works with a number of local service centers so that it can ensure a high quality of work, while also reducing the cost and amount of time it takes for repairs to be completed.
To help people on the go, the company offers an end-to-end concierge service, so car owners will no longer have to drop off their vehicles at a service center before work or pick them up at the end of the day. Instead CarDash sends a driver to their home or place of business and can usually have their car checked out within a couple of hours.
Once an initial diagnosis is done, CarDash will provide the car owner with a transparent price quote of the work that needs to be done and the cost of parts and service. The company references manufacturer recommendations as well as car service records to determine what usually needs to be done, and has part pricing data to estimate the usual cost.
Because CarDash can drive a higher volume of vehicles to the different service centers it partners with, the company can demand that its customers’ cars are looked at faster than someone driving in off the street. It also gets better pricing and makes money off the difference between what service centers charge it and the price the company quotes to customers.
The idea is to reduce or even eliminate the distrust that comes with taking one’s car to a service center, only to find that a problem isn’t fixed or that an initial diagnosis comes with a long list of other problems a mechanic might claim needs to be fixed.
Because CarDash is managing customer support, it’s incentivized to work with service centers that it knows are going to get the job done well. And because CarDash is sending mechanics business, they are incentivized to play things straight with the company.
According to founder and CEO Yinon Weiss, that means running mechanics through a rigorous screening process and occasionally doing operational testing to ensure that service centers are taking care of maintenance and problems that are diagnosed without adding additional charges to a customer’s bill.
CarDash has been operating for about a year in the San Francisco Bay Area. To date it has gotten customers mostly by partnering with local tech companies as a benefit to employees who don’t have the time to deal with having their cars looked at while working. However, the company is opening its service to anyone who might have car trouble.
CarDash is part of the current Y Combinator batch, but that hasn’t stopped it from bringing on seed funding from a group of early investors. The company has raised $5.3 million in funding led by Index Ventures and Felicis Ventures, with participation by Y Combinator, Afore Capital, NextView Ventures and NextGen Venture Partners.
With the funding, CarDash is looking to expand its team and grow operations. That means working with more local companies, growing its service center partnerships and, over time, making its service available in a greater geographic area.

Israeli startup Oryx Vision has raised a $50 million Series B round led by Third Point Ventures and WRV to help continue to develop and commercialize its innovative LiDAR tech, which is designed to be as simple as a digital camera with greater reliability and sensitivity than existing LiDAR, while also achieving a low cost.
Oryx’s LiDAR has no moving parts, and uses antennas in place of photodetectors to retrieve both range and velocity information for the points of light in its high-resolution scans of its surroundings. Oryx says its unique method means that the system is “a million times more sensitive” than existing LiDAR systems, and is also able to deal better with interference from sunlight, and from other LiDARs in operation on the road.
The startup says the level of performance its tech can achieve is “impossible with existing technologies,” and it’s also designed in a package that’s much more robust thanks to its lack of complex moving parts. That kind of physical design is very attractive in automotive applications, where consistent performance over time, and in a wide range of environmental conditions, is key to achieving automotive-grade certification.
Oryx started working on its own prototype six years ago, and now it plans to ship units suitable for testing mounted on actual cars beginning in the second half of next year. The company says the fresh funding, which also comes from Union Tech Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Maniv Mobility and Trucks VC will help it speed up its development processes and develop commercial relationships with automotive OEMs, tier 1 suppliers and other potential partners.

Faraday Future recently abandoned plans to build its own tailor-made factory from scratch in Nevada, and now it’s signed a lease on a new ready-made production facility in Hanford, Calif. The switch in strategy reflects a broader shift in the electric carmaker’s approach, which has been scaled down for earlier ambitious and lofty goals based on the company’s economic realities.
Faraday Future says the new factory, which it hopes to move into fully by November once the existing tenant departs (it was a Pirelli plant previously) should be ready to help deliver the first production FF 91 vehicles to customers by the end of 2018. Faraday unveiled the FF 91 at a splashy launch event at CES in January, which featured a reveal presided over by LeEco CEO Jia Yueting.
Despite his prominence at the event, Faraday Future is now downplaying their ties to the embattled CEO and his flailing company, which appears to be on the brink of economic collapse. In an interview with Roadshow, Faraday CFO and COO Stefan Krause said there is “no legal relationship with LeEco,” and explained that should that one-time backer go under, Faraday will remain solvent.
Still, the company needs to raise and raise big to keep things on track: It’s seeking $1 billion in fresh funding to continue its development and production plans. Financial challenges are nothing new for upstart automakers, however, and rival Tesla had to overcome similar hurdles to bring its own cars to market.
Still, there are signs that Faraday is in a very tenuous spot at the moment, and the new production plant lease looks like an attempt to demonstrate some kind of stability and path to shipping amid that chaos.

167,Tesla lowers Model X base price due to improved margins,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/05/tesla-lowers-model-x-base-price-due-to-improved-margins/,2017/08/05,"
Tesla has lowered the entry-level price of the Model X SUV, from $82,500 to $79,500. The $3,000 price drop is the result of improved margins for the electric vehicle, which the company achieved thanks to “efficiencies” achieved in the manufacturing process, Reuters reports.
Tesla’s Model X and Model S sales performance were areas of key interest during the company’s earnings report this past week, since analysts had anticipated that the Model 3 and its attractive price point could potentially drive down demand for the more expensive existing vehicles in Tesla’s lineup. It turned out that in the wake of Tesla’s splash Model 3 debut at the end of July, demand grew for both Model S and Model X, according to the company.
On Tesla’s earnings call this week, Musk said that while it’s obviously hard to predict the future, they’re seeing boosted demand coming out of the Model 3 launch, and see no reason why it won’t continue. If Model 3 ends up generating a lasting halo effect for Tesla’s higher end vehicles, that’s basically the best possible result the automaker could ask for, especially as it will be some time before it can satisfy existing demand for Model 3 with adequate production volume.
The Model X 75D’s price reduction should help stoke that demand further. Next quarter’s results will be the real ones to watch, however, as we’ll have more time and distance from the Model 3’s big press moment to evaluate whether the halo effect is a lasting one.

Toyota has agreed to purchase a five percent stake in Mazda, and will build a joint plant in the U.S. worth $1.6 billion, the automaker revealed today. Toyota also said it’s going to increase its investment in “crucial fields” related to the future of automotive technology, including self-driving, artificial intelligence and green vehicle tech.
The automaker’s greater emphasis on tech investment and R&D is a direct result of pressure from new entrants into transportation including Google, Apple and Amazon, Toyota President Akio Toyoda told press at a conference in Tokyo on Friday, according to Bloomberg.
Last month, Toyota claimed to be nearing a breakthrough in solid state battery tech that could extend the life and charge capacity of electric vehicles, and it’s also been looking to build out its expertise and product strength in ADAS and connectivity. At CES this year, Toyota also demonstrated a concept vehicle that entered around an onboard artificial intelligence smart assistant that helps the driver inside and out of the vehicle.
Toyota’s R&D spending in those “crucial” areas including AI and green energy cars is raising from 20 to 25 percent, and the joint plant will aim to be online by 2021, with a production capacity of 300,000 per year.

Tesla’s Model 3 is unique in a lot of ways, but one that stood out among the early reviews and photos was the dashboard, which is essentially unbroken by instrumentation save for that single, large 15-inch touchscreen that sits in the middle next to the steering wheel. We have photos of the dash and its various screens, but a Tesla fan put together an interactive simulation of the display user interface (via Electrek)that looks very accurate, based on what I experienced in the car itself.
The mockup actually reacts to your clicks and taps, though it’s not fully fleshed out – only so much is available to the public right now to recreate the interface. It looks to have everything I saw in the right place, however – including amazing aspects like the touch-based directional climate control UI, which works really well in practice to direct the flow of heat and AC through the basically invisible vents integrated into the dash.

The navigation map, music player and speedometer/virtual representation of your vehicle and its position relative to traffic also look true to form. Basically, if you wanted to get a sense of what it was like to drive the Model 3 from a cockpit controls standpoint ahead of actually being able to check one out (and it sounds like it’ll be a while before it even makes it to showrooms), this is your best bet.

171,Tesloop does emission-free electric freight shipping – with a Tesla Model X,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/03/tesloop-does-emission-free-electric-freight-shipping-with-a-tesla-model-x/,2017/08/03,"
Tesloop is a company that saw great potential in the Model X from Tesla – not as a consumer vehicle, but as a means of providing city to city fleet passenger transport, similar to a train or bus with added comfort and style, and with all the benefits of sustainable electric transit. Tesloop just completed its first novel use of the Tesla Model X in another capacity: As a freight vehicle, with plans this month to tow 3,500 lbs of water from a 7-UP bottling station in Modesto, CA, to Tesloop’s Culver City headquarters.
This isn’t the main business model for Tesloop, either now or in the future; it’s still focused supplementing long-distance transit with low passenger Model X personal transit, with round-trip routes throughout Southern California, and with plans to begin service to Santa Barbara next, along with pilot routes in the Bay Area.
Still, it’s a unique demonstration and a move that Tesloop says is “the first step in creating an emissions-free supply chain” that can be used more broadly. Basically, the company wanted to show that it could be done to get the ball rolling on how different transit models can be reimagined today, using technology that’s already on the road.
It’s also a marketing move for Tesloop, which is working with Noah’s Spring Water on the shipment, and which will also be offering Noah’s Water onboard its Tesloop routes as one of the many free snacks and amenities it offers to paying passengers during their trips. Other onboard features include Wi-Fi, noise-cancelling headphones and pillows.
Tesla will unveil its own electric semi truck in September, which will probably be a better way to transport sizeable cargo to and from different destinations with minimal ecological impact. For now, though, maybe strap a trailer to that Model X – plus, those gull-wing doors are perfect for loading large packages.

172,SpaceX helped Tesla with a huge headache in its cars,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/02/spacex-helped-tesla-with-a-huge-headache-in-its-cars/,2017/08/02,"
Tesla reported its second-quarter earnings today, which means a bunch of Wall Street analysts jumped on the phone to probe the ever-quotable Elon Musk — including, believe it or not, about SpaceX.
To be sure, it wasn’t specifically about space or flight — it was whether some of the innovations happening at SpaceX can be applied to Tesla. Musk runs both companies, which means it’s not out of the realm of possibility that they would share research. It turns out, in this case, that SpaceX was able to help fix a major issue in its cars that saved around 8 hours of work per car, Musk said on the call.
“There’s some really great collaboration continuously between the SpaceX teams on materials and other challenges,” explained Tesla President of Global Sales and Services Jon McNeill on the earnings call. “We had a challenge in service just over the past week where we needed to determine the quality of an object deep within our structure, an aluminum casting. That’s something that SpaceX knows how to do. Our team reached out to the SpaceX team, the SpaceX team provided us with some ultrasonic sensors so we could quickly take corrective action.”
This is semi-significant as it demonstrates the benefit of running both companies for Musk. It wouldn’t be surprising, but as both companies need to figure out how to operate successfully and be long term businesses, both need to figure out how to improve their products. For Tesla, that’s cars; for SpaceX, it’s obviously rockets. It makes sense that there would be a lot of overlap between the two when it comes to the actual science that went into building the materials.
Elon Musk called the “cross-fertilization” of thinking between the two companies very valuable, particularly in helping with “high-volume manufacturing of something that has to be extremely reliable.”
Tesla’a second quarter ended up a bit better than what Wall Street expected, with the company seeing an enormous amount of interest in the Model 3 and a surprising uptick in interest in the Model S. It seems to have quelled some concerns around Tesla, which will slowly ramp up to building a car that’s cheaper and more available for a larger audience. Tesla has a laundry list of problems to deal with — like figuring out how to build a better battery — but shaving off the edge problems means it can get up to its production targets more quickly.

173,Elon Musk says Model Y small SUV will leverage Model 3 platform after all,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/02/elon-musk-says-model-y-small-suv-will-leverage-model-3-platform-after-all/,2017/08/02,"
During its earnings call in May, Tesla CEO and founder Elon Musk said that the “Model Y” (whose name isn’t yet actually finalized, he noted) small SUV actually would use a brand new platform, totally distinct from the Model 3. On the earnings call for the company’s Q3 results on Wednesday, he noted that the company has changed its thinking, and that the Model Y will in fact leverage the Model 3 platform considerably.
“Upon the counsel of my executive team, the Model Y will in fact be using substantial carry-over from Model 3 in order to bring it to market faster,” Musk said, noting that in the interest of serving both the markets for affordable sedans and affordable SUVs (which is actually larger), it makes more sense in the near-term to make use of work it’s already done on the Model 3 instead of spinning up a brand new platform and resulting distinct production process.
“I still think we want to do the crazy thing in the future,” he added, referring to the idea of developing a brand new platform specifically for an SUV. “But we will want to punt that until after the compact SUV.”
It sounds like the change of strategy might be related to the “production hell” Musk has frequently referred to regarding the Model 3 and its manufacturing ramp. Tesla noted in its investor letter on the earnings that it would be focusing on increasing volume for Model 3 drive components and battery cells at Gigafactory 1, and once it achieves successful scale manufacturing of those parts, they should help considerably with fielding the affordable compact SUV Tesla hopes to add to its lineup next.

174,"Tesla averaging 1,800 Model 3 reservations per day since last week’s event",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/02/tesla-averaging-1800-model-3-reservations-per-day-since-last-weeks-event/,2017/08/02,"
Tesla is booking a total of around 1,800 Model 3 net reservations per day since it held an event last Friday to handover its first Model 3 production cars to employees who pre-ordered the vehicle, the company revealed in its earnings letter for Q2 2017. That’s a very impressive clip for new orders, especially given that the company already has a large backlog, according to Tesla CEO Elon Musk.
The Model 3 is designed to provide Tesla with gross margins “comparable to Model S and Model X as production scales into 2018,” even without tax and other government incentive programs, which should mean the demand will translate well into benefit for its bottom line, once it can get over the production hump and start making them at scale.
Tesla also shared some other key information about its Model 3 in the letter, including that it has opened up the Model 3 configurator to thousands of employees who placed pre-orders so they could begin choosing customization options for their orders. It also revealed that pre-order customers who aren’t employees would soon start to receive invitations to begin their own orders in small groups, based on where they are in sequence in the pre-order list. Existing Tesla vehicle owners get first priority, and deliveries outside of Tesla’s own employees will start beginning in Q4 this year.
As revealed previously, Tesla’s first pre-order shipments will be long-range battery models, which start at $44,000, and can range up depending on whether buyers opt for the addition of a $5,000 upgrade package. The entry-level Model 3 should begin shipping in the U.S. sometime in November, Tesla said in its letter to investors today.
It also noted that outside the U.S., Model 3 orders won’t begin being delivered until “late 2018,” with right-hand drive markets not receiving shipments until 2019.
Tesla notes that Model 3 is designed with fewer than 100 possible permutations at launch in order to help simplify production processes. It also said it’s fine-tuning its Gigafactory 1 production lines to help boost the rate at which it’s able to make Model 3 drive units and its own 2170 form factor battery cells, which are used in the Model 3 powerhouse. Tesla’s goal is to hit a run rate of 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by end of year, and achieve a 10,000 Model 3 per week clip at some point next year.
Interestingly, Tesla also said that rather than being down as some analysts predicted, Model S demand increased following the Model 3 event, though it’s “too early to draw strong conclusions.” If Model 3 proves a halo effect driver, that could be huge for the automaker.

Tesla appears to still be getting a lot of interest in the Model S, and in the company’s earnings report today it said there was a further increase in net Model S orders since the Model 3 handover event, though it said it was “too early to draw strong conclusions.”
While Tesla looks to broaden to a wider base of consumers, a signal like this could be a good one for the company going forward as its existing sweet spot has been luxury car owners. Tesla reported a better-than-expected second quarter, with revenue of $2.79 billion and a loss of $1.33 per share. There’s a laundry list of technical terms in its earnings release, but the main thing to note here is that the outlook for the company may be better than expected as it starts delivering the Model 3.
“This growing demand gives us even more reason to expect increased deliveries of Model S and Model X in the second half of this year,” the company said in the release.
Wall Street expected the company to post a loss of around $1.88 per share on revenue of $2.5 billion. With that beat, shares of Tesla were up around 4 percent after the earnings release came out. Tesla said it delivered 22,026 Model S and Model X vehicles this quarter for a total of 47,077 vehicles in the first half of the year. The latter falls into the low end of the production range Tesla said it expected to hit (between 47,000 and 50,000 vehicles) during its last earnings report.
Tesla began its first very early Model 3 rollout late last month, starting up the process of the company hoping to reach a broader audience beyond wealthy car enthusiasts. The Model 3, while it has a large price tag, is geared more toward the average consumer as a similar driving experience (like sitting in an iPod) with a long driving range and a smaller price point. In theory, this would help the company branch into larger competition with existing car manufacturers. Since that handover last month, the company said it is averaging more than 1,800 net Model 3 reservations per day.
Of course, that’s a while away. The company says it hopes to begin producing 100 in August, 1,500 by September, and then as many as 20,000 vehicles per month in December. It’s a slow ramp up as the company hopes to hit a run rate of producing 500,000 vehicles per year by the end of 2018. Tesla has received more than 400,000 orders to date, and it looks like it’s going to take a while for the company to fulfill all those requests.
That doesn’t seem to bother Wall Street, however. In the past 12 months, Tesla’s stock has risen more than 40 percent, and it’s up more than 50 percent since the beginning of the year. Wall Street still hammered the stock in recent months following a blistering report from Goldman Sachs.

The U.S.-Canadian border is a busy one, and a likely frequent candidate for self-driving cars to tackle in a future where streets are laden with autonomous vehicles. That’s why a forthcoming cross-border self-driving test ride (via Engadget) should be very informative.
Automotive supply giants Continental and Magna are teaming up to send autonomous vehicles from southern Michigan to Sarnia, in Ontario across the Canadian border, with crossings at both the tunnel that links Detroit and Windsor, as well as at Sarnia’s Blue Water Bridge.
The challenge will be less a technical one and more about identifying how exactly this kind of international trip will work with autonomous tech enabled, and it’ll also include segments of driver control along the route, with driverless mode enabled wherever possible.
Border crossings are also unique in a number of ways when compared to standard driving conditions, which makes it a great opportunity for gathering sensor data from the vehicle’s onboard camera, LiDAR and radar arrays. Edge cases are the big hill still left to climb for effective autonomous tech, and traveling between countries is definitely an interesting scenario to nail down.

178,Your smartphone is the key for the Tesla Model 3,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/28/your-smartphone-is-the-key-for-the-tesla-model-3/,2017/07/28,"
The Tesla Model 3 is unique in a lot of ways, but one of the more interesting is its use of your smartphone as the only key – there’s not fob, even, let alone an ignition for a traditional key. The vehicle uses the Tesla app on your smartphone to communicate your identity, unlock the vehicle, and know when it’s ready to start and turn off.
The Model 3 uses Bluetooth LE to talk to your device so that it knows you’re there, and in case you’re ever in need of a valet or spare set, the car also ships with a pair of NFC-enabled plastic cards roughly the size and shape of red cards that can unlock and start the vehicle with a tap.
This feature might strike some as unusual or maybe even a little unnerving, but it really strikes me as more of a convenience. The only thing I’m likely not to forget in any situation is my smartphone, which is basically an extension of my very being at this point in my life. It’s much easier to misplace car keys, in fact, since they’re relatively occasional use devices.
There’s a lot of technically interesting things going on with the Model 3 that really haven’t been done that much before, including a general minimizing of physical buttons that’s been pushed to new extremes among Tesla designs, and the abolishment of the instrument panel. But KO-ing keys is pretty significant, even in light of everything else.

180,Tesla is focused on Model 3 production challenges at launch,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/28/tesla-is-focused-on-model-3-production-challenges-at-launch/,2017/07/28,"
Tesla revealed more about its brand-new Model 3 than it ever has before just in time for the first deliveries to customers. We know the details of pricing and available options, as well as a bit about how Tesla plans to scale to an annual run rate of 500,000 vehicles produced per year, hopefully by the end of 2018.
“The major challenge we faced with the Model 3 is not really the product,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk noted in a pre-event briefing to press, qualifying that they nonetheless spent a lot of time getting design right. “We’re going to go through six months of production hell. it’s going to be pretty great but it’s going to be quite a challenge to produce this car.”
Musk stressed the production challenges repeatedly in his initial comments regarding the car, in fact, noting that the manufacturing process for something as complex as this vehicle is bound to occur on an S-curve, and that there are “10,000 unique components in the car,” with production speed ultimately bound to move only “as fast as the slowest one.”

To help make the production ramp easier, Tesla made some specific decisions about the vehicle, including the interior of the car, which is something the automaker hasn’t discussed much prior to today.
“We’ve intentionally gone for a very simple interior with a single screen,” Musk explained, showing off a cabin that was intentionally designed to maximize available interior volume while still keeping the outside of the vehicle as small as possible.
There is no header behind the second-row seats, for instance, something lead designer Franz von Holzhausen explained is designed to open up the available space for passengers.
“There’s nothing behind your head, so it just feels like a nice, big, open rear seat,” he said. “Interior volume is important to us – it’s a part of function.”
This is partly because the Model 3 was designed with the long view of autonomy in mind. Musk explained that its production includes the same sensor hardware as the Model S and Model X, despite other features and design elements being pared back considerably to help increase manufacturing efficiencies. Increased automation is one factor that’s helping, but there’s a lot more to improving the process going on.
Musk said that Tesla can make around 250,000 Model 3 vehicles in the same space as it takes to make 50,000 Model S cars currently, with a fivefold increase in manufacturing capability achieved through process simplification. This includes sticking with a single-motor rear drive design initially, as well as using much more steel. About 50 percent of the vehicle is steel, while the other half is aluminum. The Model S, by comparison, is nearly all aluminum, which is harder to use in production.

Still, Musk continually returned to the challenges represented by manufacturing and ramping the production process.
“The biggest challenge we face is S-curve manufacturing,” he said. “That S-curve portion is us going through hell basically.”
That hell, he said, was the worst on the Tesla Roadster, despite using a Lotus chassis for the vehicle. It was marginally better on the Model S, he said, but still “hell,” and on the Model X, it was roughly as difficult as it was on the Model S, which it shouldn’t have been given that it managed to re-use a lot of the components from the X.
Ultimately, that S-curve is something Tesla is confident it can achieve, Musk said, but it’s very difficult to predict what shape it’ll take, given factors, including ‘force majeure’ risks from a supply chain that includes up to 30 percent of components coming from outside North America.
OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA
Still, Musk did seem relatively confident in that end-of-2018 date for hitting 500,000 vehicles per year, which would go a long way to addressing pent-up demand. And regarding demand, Musk said that while the number of reservations is a false indicator when it comes to measuring true demand (since Tesla does “everything we can to unsell the car”), it’s currently sitting at over half a million advance reservations in place.
“If we did anything to even not put the brake on demand, it would go bananas,” Musk said. “But we don’t have to do that yet.”

181,Everything you want to know about the Tesla Model 3,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/28/everything-you-want-to-know-about-the-tesla-model-3/,2017/07/28,"
The Tesla Model 3 is now a known quantity – we have information about the different kit options available at launch, as well as interior and exterior measurements, and car performance and cabin comforts. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that the whole point was to make car that is “the best car, hands down,” for “anything close to the same cost,” and it makes a strong case for that on paper.
The Model 3 starts at $35,000, as previously announced, but now we know exactly what that will get you. Here’s the base level configuration for the new EV:

220 miles of range
130 miles of range recouped via 30 minutes of charging with Supercharger
30 miles of range per hour with home 240V, 32A charger
0-60 mph in 5.6 seconds
130 mph top speed

For an additional $9,000, you can upgrade to the long-range battery version, which comes to $44,000 in total before tax or credits. That includes the following boosted specs:

310 miles of range
170 miles of range achieved in just 30 minutes of charging via Supercharger
37 miles of charging per hour at home with 240V, 40A charger
0-60 mph in 5.1 seconds
140 mph top speed

Both cars feature the same interior, with a 15-inch touchscreen display that provides access to your virtual instrument panel, media and climate controls.

The car also features a number of convenience features standard, including:

Onboard navigation
Wi-Fi and LTE connection
Keyless entry via the Tesla app (there is no key or FOB for the vehicle)
Voice controls
Back-up camera
Rear seats that fold 60/40 (not full flat) for added cargo
Rear-view mirror that auto dims in low light
Dual zone climate control
Front console with two USB ports

Other options include a Premium Upgrade Package which rolls a number of finish and feature improvements for $5,000, complete with:

Heated seating and better cabin materials, including “open pore wood décor”
Two rear USB ports
Power adjustable front seats, steering column and side mirrors (which are very cool)
Subwoofer and premium audio system with surround
Tinted glass roof
Power folding heated side mirrors that dim automatically
Docking ports up front for two smartphones
LED fog lights

The vehicle also has all the sensors necessary to offer Enhanced Autopilot right now, which is another $5,000 upgrade and includes speed matching, lane keeping, automatic lane switching and self-park. The hardware offers the potential for full-self driving down the road, once it becomes available, too – which adds another $3,000 to the cost. Seven cameras, forward radar and twelve ultrasonic sensors are included in total in the vehicle.

Other paid upgrades include color options beyond the basic black, which include metallic silver, deep blue and ‘midnight silver’ (a very nice looking slate gray), as well as a pearl white and red. Each of these is a $1,000 upgrade, and then you can also upgrade from the 18-inch standard wheels to a 19-inch sport variety for $1,500.
All-told, a fully upgraded Model 3 retails for $59,500 before tax or incentives, which is still quite a reasonable deal given what you’re getting, especially when measured up against comparable gas fuel burning vehicles.
The base Model 3 is going to be shipping later than the version with the upgraded battery pack, which is what will be shipping out to the first customers over the next three months exclusively. If you’ve been waiting to see what the Model 3 has to offer in terms of actual detailed specs, now’s the time to put down a reservation if you’re feeling inclined – the line extends likely into 2019 at this point, and is only liable to keep growing.

182,Here’s what it’s like to drive the Tesla Model 3,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/28/heres-what-its-like-to-drive-the-tesla-model-3/,2017/07/28,CONTENT ERROR
183,What to expect from Tesla as the Model 3 hits the road,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/28/what-to-expect-from-tesla-as-the-model-3-hits-the-road/,2017/07/28,"
The first 30 Tesla Model 3s are officially being delivered to their owners later today, meaning there’s a non-zero chance you’ll see them on roads in California, and not for testing. Gradually, that number of Model 3s on real streets driven by people just going about their daily lives will grow, and Tesla says it hopes to be producing 100 in August, then 1,500 by September, and as many as 20,000 per month beginning in December.
We know the planned production schedule, but we still don’t know everything about the car itself. Tesla is limiting configuration options on early Model 3 shipments, with the aim of simplifying the production process to help expedite its creation and make sure things go as smoothly as possible, but we don’t yet know what the Model 3 configuration options that are available will look like, beyond Musk’s assertion that you’ll basically be able to choose paint colour and wheel size, and that’s about it.
We have a comparison chart between the Model 3 and Model S that reveal the Model 3 will have a 0 to 60 mph time of 5.6 seconds, “215+” miles of range per charge, 5 seats, 14 cubic feet of trunk space between front and rear compartments, and under 100 total possible configurations. It’ll also have a single 15-inch touchscreen display in the center console, instead of the 17-inch one in the Model S (and added driver display in the instrument panel).
We’re hoping to get a better look at the car overall during tonight’s handoff ceremony, including close-up views of the exterior, and a lot more insight into what’s going on inside the car, since thus far Tesla has kept the vehicle’s interior relatively close to the vest. The cockpit and dash design will be particularly interesting to potential drivers.
The big remaining questions that need answer, though, are pretty basic: What’s the Model 3 going to cost, and what are the specifics of its motors and batteries, and the options available in that respect to prospective owners?
It’s both astounding and impressive that Tesla has received over 400,000 orders to date, with a production queue that extends to at least the end of 2018 for any new orders placed currently – for a car for which buyers don’t know the specific final cost or specs. Tesla has received plenty of plaudits for its brand power, but the Apple-like ability of the automaker to get consumers to come out in droves and plunk down money for a future product based on little to no information has, if anything, been understated.
Tonight’s handover event is bound to result in one thing, for sure: Happy Tesla Model 3 owners. But hopefully it’ll also provide some clarity about the car itself, and what future owners beyond this small initial group can expect when their number comes due.
Tune in this evening, via live stream or right here on TechCrunch to find out right along with us.

If you want to check out the Tesla Model 3 special handover event, where the carmaker will provide its first 30 production vehicles to a group of early buyers (mostly staff), then you’re in luck: It’s happening tonight at 9 PM PT, with a live stream kicking off at 8:45 PM PT.
The stream will be carried live on Tesla.com, which is where you can tune in to enjoy the show. It’ll likely be a somewhat flashy affair, based on an Instagram post shared by Tesla CEO Elon Musk that showed preparations underway for the big event, with large light signs shining on the side of the Fremont-based Tesla factory.

Tesla’s already rolled one production Model 3 off the line, but it was destined for Elon Musk himself – a pre-order customer who actually secured the rights to the first vehicle gifted Musk his place in line as a birthday present, and Musk took delivery on July 9.

185,Ford’s Chariot shuttles are expanding to New York City,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/27/fords-chariot-shuttles-are-expanding-to-new-york-city/,2017/07/27,"
Ford is adding its largest market yet for Chariot, the crowd-sourced shuttle service that it acquired last September. Chariot began operations in San Francisco, where the former startup ran commuter routes of its branded transit vans, and expanded to Austin after that. In August, it’ll begin service in New York City, with two debut routes running from the Lower East Side to Midtown in Manhattan, and from Greenpoint to Dumbo in Brooklyn.
Chariot’s goal is to supplement existing transit solutions, addressing gaps in transit and completing commuter options with first- and last-mile additions, or with routes for underserved areas. Riders can check routes in the Chariot app, and even propose their own new routes that contribute to the company’s crowdsourcing efforts in determining how best to serve actual user needs.
Chariot CEO Ali Vahabzadeh told me in an interview that he believes this is “a pretty opportune time for Chariot to introduce its reliable and accessible services in New York,” hinting at the frequency and severity of service disruptions we’ve seen in the city this summer so far. Chariot’s goal is to supplement existing options with flexible, fluid routes that respond quickly to rider needs, servicing areas with shuttle vans that hold over a dozen passengers. Theoretically, the flexibility of its model allows it so help compensate for prolonged service outages on regular public transit lines.
The initial lines were chosen through partnership with Ford’s data analytics team, Vahabzadeh explained, which looked at multiple factors and ran a multi-step narrowing process to identify the best starting points for expanding to the city.
“LES and Greenpoint are two very high-growth boroughs that haven’t historically had a lot of public transit alternatives,” he said.
And while Chariot has been working with New York’s Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) to make sure everything its doing is “licensed and above board,” Vahabzadeh also suggested the two are not working in any kind of close collaboration at this stage. He said Chariot’s first goal was to “get the service and the product out there and to prove to all stakeholders involved what Chariot is really capable of.”
“We like to do first and talk second,” he said. “We think conversations will develop and evolve after we launch.”
Ford’s Jessica Robinson, Director of City Solutions, noted that the automaker often encounters confusion about why it’s working on urban transportation solutions like this one that are normally left to city services. She said that the company actually has a long history of wanting to help people get around, and that all that’s changed is the form that goal has taken.
“It’s a natural extension of what we’ve always been out to do,” she said. “I think the shift that we’re making as the world changes is the understanding of what we can do in that space. We think that with our history as a technology integrator, and with our special place in cities, we have a key role to play there.”
Meanwhile, Vahabzadeh is excited about what this New York expansion could mean for Chariot’s evolution.
“I think the public is going to use Chariot and micro-transit in different ways [in NYC],” he said. “Using Chariot in Brooklyn when the L-train is shut down, or event-based transit, for example. We can keep these running around the clock, with high-participation occupancy rates, so we’re going to learn a whole new set of lessons we can add to our playbook.”
Chariot plans to have 60 vehicles on the road by this fall in NYC, and it’s currently operating over 200 in SF, and around 50 in Austin. The company still employs less than 100 non-driver staff, which is impressive given the size of its operation, but expect that to shift up as its New York presence grows.

186,Waze finally arrives on Android Auto,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/26/waze-finally-arrives-on-android-auto/,2017/07/26,"
After a beta that kicked off earlier in 2017, crowdsourced navigation app Waze is coming to Android Auto. The Google-owned Waze seemed like a shoe-in for gaining app support for Android’s native in-car mode, but it’s taken a while to bring it to Android Auto – but the months-long beta and the time show that Waze wanted to get the experience right for drivers.
The Waze experience in Android Auto actually brings a lot of the app’s experience to your in-car display, provided you have a vehicle that supports Android Auto like the Chevrolet Cruze I tested it with earlier this week. The interface includes features like accident, delay, police and hazard reporting just like you’ll find in the mobile app, but translated to your car’s infotainment screen with native UI elements that are suited for the larger canvas.
It’s pretty easy to report delay-causing factors using the large, 7-inch center mounted infotainment touchscreen with the Waze UI; the whole thing is built around making this possible in as few steps as possible, with UI elements like icons and menus that use large font, and a minimum of selection options to help minimize distraction. I used the car’s built-in 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot for data, but you could just as easily use the data on the phone for map updates and two-way communication with the Waze reporting service.

The Cruze also has a steering wheel mounted voice control button, which you can hold down to ask Waze for directions. This works regardless of where you are in the Android Auto UI, provided you have Waze selected as your navigation app (the default is Maps, but a long press on the navigation icon in Android Auto easily allows you to switch it up). In my experience, voice searching worked well and returned relevant results.
Waze users can also call up their saved home and work addresses, as well as favorited destinations for easy one-touch navigation. You’ll see crowd-sourced reports of potential delays ahead on the live map as you navigate, and you’ll also receive updates about potential alternate routes that could save you time which you can opt-in to on the fly.
The Waze Android Auto port is so complete that you also get its in-app location-based advertising platform, including map pins for local sponsored spots and promoted search results. That’s good news for Waze on the advertiser side, since it opens up to the platform to a broader potential audience of Android Auto users. The one thing it doesn’t offer, however, is the ability to run it on Android Auto running on a smartphone in standalone mode – you’ll need to be plugged into a vehicle or head unit to use Waze in Android Auto itself.
Overall, in my brief usage Waze was a great navigation option on Android Auto, and one that carried over essentially everything about the mobile app that drives its high engagement with its dedicated fan base.

187,Toyota’s new solid-state battery could make its way to cars by 2020,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/25/toyotas-new-solid-state-battery-could-make-its-way-to-cars-by-2020/,2017/07/25,"
Toyota is touting its progress on a new kind of battery technology, which uses a solid electrolyte instead of the conventional semi-liquid version used in today’s lithium-ion batteries. The car maker said that it’s near a breakthrough in production engineering that could help it put the new tech in production electric vehicles as early as 2020, according to the Wall Street Journal.
The improved battery technology would make it possible to create smaller, more lightweight lithium-ion batteries for use in EVs, that could also potentially boost the total charge capacity and result in longer-range vehicles.
Another improvement for this type of battery would be longer overall usable life, which would make it possible to both use the vehicles they’re installed in for longer, and add potential for product recycling and alternative post-vehicle life (some companies are already looking into putting EV batteries into use in home and commercial energy storage, for example).
Batteries remain a key limiting factor for electric vehicle design, because of how far tech companies focused on the problem have pushed existing science. The move to solid state would help make room for more gains in terms of charge capacity achieved in the footprint available in consumer vehicles, while helping to push further existing efficiencies achieved through things like the use of ultra-light materials in car frames and interiors.
Toyota isn’t saying yet where its batteries will end up, but any edge here is bound to be a big boon for automakers looking at a future that increasingly seems like it’ll be dominated by EVs.

Tesla’s Model S once again occupies the top rating spot in the Consumer Reports ultra-luxury sedan category, after the automaker put out a software update that brought automatic emergency braking (AEB) to highway speeds for Model S vehicles with the second-generation hardware package.
Tesla had rolled back some of its automated safety and driver assistance features for vehicles manufactured after October 2016, since it switched its sensor loadout and onboard computing capabilities at that time to prepare the way for the eventual introduction of fully automated driving down the road. Tesla also started using in-house hardware vs. that of a supplier at that time, and both changes necessitated rework on the software front vs. the first-generation Autopilot features.
Consumer Reports believes that AEB features offer significant safety benefits to vehicles, and so decided to dock the Model S some points in its rating system since not all vehicles on the road were equipped with the feature following the changeover. Tesla began rolling out OTA updates with the AEB feature re-introduced for cars made after October 2016 starting in late April, and another update changed the upwards limit of enabled AEB from 28 mph to 90 mph, which is why Consumer Reports returned the Model S to its top spot.

BMW Group today revealed more information about its forthcoming battery electric Mini car, which will join the existing internal combustion and hybrid options as a pillar of the lineup. The all-electric model will be a “variant of the brand’s core 3 door model,” BMW revealed for the first time today, and will enter production in 2019 alongside the rest of the Mini lineup.
The electric Mini’s drivetrain will be supplied by the company’s Landshut and Dingolfing plans in Bavaria, and they’ll be assembled with the rest of the vehicle at the main production plan in Oxford. The plan for BMW is part of its overarching strategy of developing a flexible vehicle structure that will make it possible to electrify every vehicle series in its lineup.
While BMW’s electrification roadmap extends well beyond 2020, in the immediate future the new Mini will be joined by a MBW i8 Roadster in 2018, and an all-electric X3 starting in 2020. The plug-in Mini Countryman variant is the latest in its overall alternative powertrain range of offerings.
No word yet on further details regarding the all-electric Mini, but expect more to be available soon since that 2019 production timeline is not all that far off in terms of automaker manufacturing timelines.

Ford’s latest Mustang GT is the fastest ever – in its new Drag Strip mode, it can do 0-to-60 mph in under four seconds, which is faster than a lot of expensive sports cars, including the Porsche 911. The Drag Strip mode setting optimizes torque, and transmission to achieve the new acceleration, and hits that sub-four second time when paired with Michelin Pilot Sport 4 S tires on the car.
This new record is also achieved on the Mustang’s new SelectShift 10-speed automatic transmission, which helps improve speeds because, according to Mustang chief engineer Carl Widmann, “when you shift gears, you give up time.”

191,Daimler and Bosch create a driverless parking garage,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/24/daimler-and-bosch-create-a-driverless-parking-garage/,2017/07/24,"

Daimler and Bosch teamed up to bring autonomous driving tech to one of the more annoying parts of driving – finding and parking a vehicle. Their automated valet system is debuting today at the parking garage for the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart, Germany, making it easy for vehicles to simple drive up, leave their vehicle, and trust the system to negotiate the multi-story parking facility, find and park in a spot.
The valet system will actually be able to work for museum visitors starting in 2018, with visitors able to reserve cars from the facility using a smartphone app. The vehicle then autonomously heads to the pick-up spot, and then once the visitor is through and wants to drop off the car, they simply drive it up to the drop-off zone and check it in using the same smartphone app. The car then drives itself to its assigned parking spot, guided by the facility’s infrastructure and its own onboard sensors.
The infrastructure component is supplied by Bosch, and it works in concert with the car tech provided by Mercedes-Benz on its vehicles. There are sensors both throughout the structure, and on the car, providing info both about where vehicles are located and moving throughout the facility, as well as making it possible for the vehicle to sense and react to objects in its path, including pedestrians.
Today’s debut will be followed by a lengthy trial phase, and local regulators are also involved throughout in monitoring its progress. It’ll need sign-off from safety agencies and local government before it goes into full pilot operation, but Bosch and Daimler believe this will take place at the beginning of next year.
The goal of the project is to find out how people react to having automated parking services available, and how they use the service. Bosch and Daimler note that it’s possible to retrofit existing parking structures with similar tech, which could lead to up to 20 percent more efficiency in use of their available capacity. This is another way autonomous tech could change the face of our cities without requiring extensive infrastructure replacement – and it could happen sooner than self-driving on city streets and roads.

Nexar has released a dataset that it says is the world’s largest photo set featuring geographically diverse images for automotive tech development, for an open competition. There are 55,000 tagged photos in the set, taking from over 80 countries, in a variety of lighting and weather conditions. Each of the photos is taken from street level, using Nexar’s community-based V2V dashcam app for iOS and Android, and the goal of the release is to help drive the development of autonomous driving perception models that can handle a wide range of weather, road and country variety.
The release of Nexar’s image set, which it calls NEXET, is part of a challenge issued by the company to researchers to create a perception system for self-driving cars that’s able to work in a range of different settings, across geographical borders, while delivering consistent performance in all cases.
Nexar says that their goal is to address a significant gap in a lot of current research, which uses imagery for training that comes from either very circumscribed real world areas, or from simulations or lab-based environments. Any software developer knows that there are issues you only come across when dealing with real-world conditions, and that’s definitely true for training autonomous driving systems, which still face a huge hurdle in terms of addressing edge cases. With an iPhone app, outlier use cases have relatively low stakes; with driving, they could mean the difference between life and death.
Nexar’s whole goal is to build an Advanced Driver Assistance System that combines data from multiple streams via consumer devices around the world, and its competition is designed to help it further its own efforts. But the ultimate value to the industry is also apparent, and it’s rare to come across this size and type of dataset in the wild.

193,Kakao is putting speech recognition tech into cars from Hyundai and Kia,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/24/kakao-hyundai-kia-speech-recognition-tech/,2017/07/24,"
Less than a month after announcing plans to spin out its transportation and mobility business, Korean tech firm Kakao has inked deals to put hands-free systems inside cars from Korea’s second largest automotive firm Hyundai and its Kia affiliate.
Kakao is best known for operating Korea’s top messaging app, Kakao Talk, which is installed on over 95 percent of the country’s smartphones. But it has branched out into other verticals beyond chat, AI being one of them.
‘Kakao I’ — the firm’s AI tech — will be integrated in select cars from Hyundai and Kia starting from September with the initial goal of offering in-car speech recognition technology. Both auto firms have helped develop the service, which includes ‘One Shot,’ a hands-free feature that lets drivers search for information, such as restaurants, service stations and more using their voice.
Beyond that, Kakao I features support for speech and image recognition, text-to-speech, natural language processing, image recognition and chatbots, the company said. Kakao plans to open the platform up to third-parties, potentially bringing more services and features to drivers inside the comfort of their car.
Kakao said it had begun developing self-driving car technology back in September, but these partnerships are not related to that push.
Hyundai has been one of the early movers on self-driving cars, in fact it was first to get a license in Korea, beating even Samsung. The firm debuted its prototypes in December, going on to launch its semi-driving features earlier than originally scheduled.

GM has been doing a lot to try to make it easier for developers to create software for use in their vehicle infotainment systems. Back in January, it opened up access to a wide range of data points from the vehicle, and made it possible to develop using a simulator on the desktop, instead of having to use very specific developer hardware based in Detroit.
Now, GM is introducing GM Dev Client, an app that makes it possible for developers to test their in-vehicle software creations in real world conditions in actual cars, including performing real-time updates to the code via a laptop to implement tweaks and changes while the car is moving (handled by a passenger, and not a driver, of course).
This is a big change in how developers build for and target automaker native software platforms: It’s something has never been optimized for broad development efforts in the way that iOS or Android are, for instance. There are still controls in place that help ensure safety is a top priority, but this drastically removes the friction involved in building apps for use in cars.
To get to the stage where developers can test in-car, they first have to download and install the NGI SDK (the software kit GM released at the start of this year to allow development on virtualized infotainment environments on the desktop). Once you’ve built your app, you can submit it to GM for internal review, and once it’s approved, GM will make the Dev Client available via the developer’s AppShop. Developers provide their car’s unique vehicle identification number to get whitelisted.
Being aggressive with supporting developers and improving the process of creating apps for its vehicles is a smart move at this juncture: GM has drastically improved this process from end to end in just six months, and that should help them win more buy-in from developers targeting in-car early to get ahead of the coming autonomous wave.

195,Lyft launches a new self-driving division and will develop its own autonomous ride-hailing technology,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/21/lyft-launches-a-new-self-driving-division-called-level-5-will-develop-its-own-self-driving-system/,2017/07/21,"
Lyft is betting the future of the road centers on sharing autonomous vehicles. It aims to be at the forefront of that technology with a new self-driving division and a self-driving system car manufacturers could plug into their self-driving cars.
The company expects to hire “hundreds” of people for the new division by the end of next year and has just signed a lease for 50,000-square-feet on the first floor of a Palo Alto facility where it plans to build out several labs and open testing spaces. The building Lyft refers to as “Level 5” will be developing its new “open self-driving platform” and a combination hardware and software system still in development. Lyft hopes auto manufacturers will then bring in a fleet of autonomous cars to its ride-hailing network.
The plan is somewhat similar to one Uber announced earlier. Lyft’s larger rival uses Volvo’s XC90 to test its self-driving tech on the roads. Uber announced earlier this year it was also partnering with Daimler to operate self-driving cars on its network.
In Lyft’s corner, there’s GM, Waymo, JLR and a recently announced self-driving pilot program with the Boston-based autonomous car tech startup Nutonomy.
Lyft’s chief strategy officer Raj Kapoor wouldn’t comment on comparisons between the two but did say Lyft had the means to attract top talent, a list of trusted partners and critical data needed to build out the system.
A lot of what will come out of this system seems TBD for now. Lyft will still need to hire that top talent, build out its engineering team and work out how to share data with each car manufacturer it partners with.
There may also be some regulatory issues. Comma.ai canceled sales of its own self-driving kit, which allowed certain cars to gain autopilot-like highway driving assistance abilities, after a warning letter from the National Highway and Travel Safety Administration (NHTSA). The issue stemmed from regulations around selling such a kit. Rather than fighting the NHTSA, Comma.ai later open-sourced the blueprint for the kit, allowing anyone to build it themselves for free.
However, Lyft employs a team to work on regulatory matters and has made in-roads in Washington for other issues in the past.
The other thing to consider, with all this talk of unleashing the unmanned robots to drive us, is the toll it will take on Uber’s and Lyft’s human drivers. Though Lyft believes the day we replace all the humans is far off, it makes economic sense for ridesharing companies to veer down that path and autonomous vehicles will inevitably take over at some point.
Lyft has said in the past that these drivers could transition into new roles within the company and that the new technology will create new jobs. It’s not clear if all the drivers would get new jobs, how many jobs would be created or how much they’d be paid. It’s also not clear if they’d go for a more traditional role rather than the freedom they once enjoyed making their own hours as a driver.
But there could be an option B – drivers converting their cars with Lyft’s kits much like Comma.ai and Cruise Automation offer the ability to convert vehicles already on the road. Kapoor told TechCrunch it would be possible to convert cars already on the road and Luc Vincent, Lyft’s new VP of engineering who will head up the new self-driving division also seemed intrigued by the idea when I floated it.
“It’s not something I’ve heard us talk about but it’s something to think about,” Vincent said.

196,The virtual used car dealership Shift raises $38 million,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/19/the-virtual-used-car-dealership-shift-raises-38-million/,2017/07/19,"
Shift, the online used car reseller that takes the crappy dealership out of the sales experience, has raised $38 million in its latest round of funding.
The company, which is wildly popular among millennials that still buy cars, managed to raise the money from investors led by BMW i Ventures, which has been on an investment tear recently.
Other new investors in the round included DCM Ventures and G2VP, as well as continued participation from DFJ, Highland Capital and Goldman Sachs Investment Partners.
As a result of the investment, Christian Noske, a partner with i Ventures, has taken a seat on the Shift board of directors, with Jason Kirkorian of DCM and Brook Porter of G2VP joining as board observers.
“Our fund one was focused on customer experiences and creating an excitement for consumers,” said Noske of the decision to invest in Shift. “We believe car buying and car selling is still a very high-touch business… you want to see it, you want to sit in it.”
And the success of Shift belies many stories that younger generations of car buyers are more interested in the sharing economy than in owning vehicles.
“The notion of ownership and usage is based on availability on those [carsharing] services. Those services are not readily available everywhere in the U.S.,” Noske tells me. “A huge part of the population lives outside of that where you might have a child or a family and then owning a car is very important.”
Only 20 percent of jobs in the U.S. are reachable by mass transit in less than 90 minutes, says Noske, which means, for much of the United States, cars are still a necessity.
“What the dealerships haven’t been able to do is figure out how to sell cars to young people,” says George Arison, the chief executive of Shift.
While Shift falls into the wheelhouse of the i Venture group’s initial mandate, the investment arm that’s affiliated with BMW has expanded the scope of its investments well beyond the dealership and the customer experience.
The company said it will use the money to expand geographically.

“BMW is, without a doubt, one of the most iconic car brands in the world, which truly makes this a pinch-me moment for the entire Shift team,” said Arison in a statement. “We are also honored to have DCM and G2VP join us with such significant participation in this round.”
With the investment the company has raised more than $110 million.

197,Run your startup the Toyota way,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/19/run-your-startup-the-toyota-way/,2017/07/19,"
Toyota is known for its manufacturing efficiency. We’ve probably all heard that if a worker on the Camry line sees a problem, they have the authority to stop the line and address it. At the end of the day, teams meet to discuss what went wrong and what fixes actually fixed things. It’s called the Toyota Production System, or TPS, and, like any tech cult, it’s got lots of lingo and acronyms. (Try throwing around “Let’s kaizen this” if you want to seem in the know.) But it also can work for a startup as easily as it can work for the massive automotive manufacturer.
Jamie Bonini, the vice president of the Toyota Production System Support Center, preaches the TPS gospel to organizations in North America and, recently, Australia. He’s worked with small manufacturers, hospitals and government agencies to teach them how to use Toyota’s principles in their particular settings. “You start with the customer,” Bonini said during a panel at the Aspen Ideas Festival. “Are they getting what they want? Then you work back from there.”
The point of TPS is to create a culture where problems are not repeated in order to achieve the end goal of improving quality. That’s as applicable to apps as it is to automobiles. In an interview after the panel, Bonini outlined the basics of the system, which has three parts:

The philosophy that the customer needs to be served by the process and that the people who create the widget — whether that’s a car or a car-sharing app — are the most valuable resource in the organization.
The use of tech tools to establish flow through entire organization — and to halt that flow when necessary. Managers need to develop their teams so that the people closest to the problem can solve that problem.
The application of engineering and design to understand that flow, from the overall project plan to the precise sequence of steps required to complete a task. This can be reviewed every day or every week, but it needs to be revisited often.

These pillars, Bonini said, are “timeless.” Advanced technology can make the TPS system work better, but the focus on people — both those in the organization and the customer at the end of the process — remains an important part of the triangle.
“All three pieces of TPS must work,” Bonini said. “A lot of business leaders have never heard of all three pieces; they put all their emphasis on the tech tools.” Whether you’re in a 10-person startup or a 1,000-employee hospital, these three principals should work together to create a culture of trust and innovation.
Oh, and kaizen, for the record, is the process of changing things for the better, or in business terms, continuously improving the system at every step and every level.

198,Nauto raises $159M to fuel expansion of its autonomous driving data platform,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/19/nauto-raises-159m-to-fuel-expansion-of-its-autonomous-driving-data-platform/,2017/07/19,"
Nauto, a Palo Alto company focused on retrofitting existing vehicle fleets with networked safety camera-equipped devices, has raised $159 million in a Series B round led by SoftBank (which has been quite spendy lately) and Reid Hoffman at Greylock. The company’s products focus on gathering data about human drivers and their behavior in order to improve safety practices right now, but their platform also has a second, potentially more lucrative purpose: building a huge data set that can prove very valuable in the development of self-driving cars.
That’s where SoftBank’s interest lies, according to CEO Masayoshi Son, who noted in a statement that “Nauto is generating a highly valuable dataset for autonomous driving, at a massive scale,” in addition to establishing itself as a telematics business that can produce revenue right now, while simultaneously amassing a library of data from a huge cumulative pool of real-world driving hours.
The potential value of this data for autonomous driving is a big reason why a number of automakers have also made strategic investments in Nauto, including General Motor Ventures, Toyota AI Ventures and BMW iVentures. This funding will help really accelerate the pace of that data gathering effort, giving Nauto the ability to “more rapidly… gather the billions more miles of real driving experience and data required to get a precise understanding of how the best drivers behave behind the wheel,” according to Nauto CEO Stefan Heck.
Nauto’s tech uses a dual-camera windshield-mounted device, with one camera facing inward tracking driver behavior and the other facing outward to monitor the road. The company employs deep learning and computer vision to process the data collected by its units in the cloud, and provide insights and coaching services to counter things like driver distraction and fatigue.
One of the big advantages of Nauto as a stepping stone to autonomy, however, is the cost of deployment — its hardware is relatively inexpensive and can be used immediately with vehicles on the road today, following a simple installation process. One of self-driving’s biggest challenges remains a simple issue of volume, and Nauto is positioned well to help address that because of its low friction, low cost and immediate returned value to fleet operators.

We already knew Microsoft Azure Cloud was a member of Baidu’s Apollo self-driving platform alliance, but now Microsoft has revealed more details about what it will be providing the cross-industry partnership. Basically, Microsoft will be offering cloud infrastructure services via Azure for customers in markets outside of China looking to adopt Apollo, which Baidu has described as an open, “Android of the autonomous driving industry.”
Apollo, which Baidu knowingly named after the original lunar landing program because it sees a similar scale of cross-industry cooperation required to bring autonomous driving to market, is meant to offer cloud services, open software, and reference vehicle, sensor and computing hardware. The alliance includes a number of top industry players, including mapping company TomTom, Bosh, Continental, Nvidia, and Uber competitor Grab, in addition to Microsoft.
Microsoft has also been aggressive in nailing down partnerships in the growing autonomous and automotive cloud services space – it’s working with BMW, Ford, Renault-Nissan, Toyota and Volvo on a range of different projects, and its work with Baidu and Apollo could add a host of new OEM partners to that list, depending on uptake.
Apollo is intended to be released to developers and automakers via staged releases, including access to self-driving tech for circumscribed, restricted areas by month’s end. Baidu has said that it hopes to deploy a platform that can fully handle autonomous driving in both urban and highway settings by the end of 2020, which is a very ambitious target for the nascent project, but in line with stated expectations about self-driving commercial launches from leading automakers.

200,Hyundai launching its semi self-driving features earlier than planned,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/17/hyundai-launching-its-semi-self-driving-features-earlier-than-planned/,2017/07/17,"
The race to bring self-driving features to market is stepping up in a big way, now that GM’s Super Cruise is set to arrive in the Cadillac CT6 later this year, and Audi has announced it’ll ship its Level 3 self-driving tech in the next A8. Hyundai is speeding up its own timeline for commercialization of its “Highway Driving Assist 2” (HDA2) semi-autonomous features as a result.
The HDA2 system is properly considered a Level 2 autonomous feature, similar to Tesla’s Autopilot. The software handles speed and stops in highway driving conditions, and also handles changing to a crossroad, entering a junction, and merging onto a main road automatically when a driver indicates their intent to do so via their turn signal.
The introduction of HDA2 will “minimize intervention by drivers,” according to Hyundai speaking to the Electronic Times. The tech “nears level 3 on freeways” according to the company, and its introduction will help to achieve the carmaker’s goals of commercializing fully autonomous vehicles for consumers by 2022.
Hyundai had self-driving tech on display at CES, and has espoused a lightweight approach in terms of computing and sensor types in favor of detailed maps to keep costs down for consumers. The company is not generally perceived as a leader in the space, however, and deploying this tech earlier than intended could help it make up ground thanks to data collection efforts.

201,Roborace DevBot learns during laps in NYC,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/16/roborace-devbot-learns-during-laps-in-nyc/,2017/07/16,"
The sleek, low-slung driverless Roborace car was on display in New York City for the Formula E races this weekend, but it was the workhorse DevBot that took to the track. You can recognize DevBot by its bubble-like cockpit, where a human sits ready to take the wheel if the autonomous car needs a literal hand.
Given Formula E‘s one-day structure, with qualifying sessions early in the day and the race in the afternoon, Roborace is able to take advantage of the empty track in the middle of the day for demonstrations of its artificial intelligence system on wheels. DevBot did a practice run early Saturday morning, then spent an hour taking laps in front of the crowd in the afternoon.

DevBot has an array of sensors, plus advanced GPS for navigating the track, which is not preprogrammed into the car’s computers. It reads the track and learns the route as it goes, which means DevBot drives much more slowly than the Formula E cars. An in-car camera behind the driver’s shoulder was projected on large screens around the track so spectators could see if — and when — the driver had to put hands on the wheel.
DevBot could only navigate about half a lap in New York without intervention. It found Turn Six particularly tricky. The completely driverless Roborace car did take a lap on its own in Paris, but it was moving more slowly than DevBot in New York. Here in New York, the driver took control for a lap, likely to train the AI at speed. Well, sort of at speed. DevBot wasn’t built for full-out racing speeds so much as for processing speeds.
While nerdy types found this hour of DevBot’s AI education interesting, run-of-the-mill racing fans were less impressed. Some fans I spoke to expected DevBot to be faster and for the driver to provide less input — like, zero. They also expected the Roborace car, in red and white livery, to take a lap, rather than the cruder-looking DevBot, despite its cheerful American flag theme.
There’s no official word on when Roborace vehicles will be ready to actually race. There was an optimistic idea that the field of 20 driverless cars would be taking to the track in the 2017/2018 season, but DevBot’s demonstration on Saturday showed that a fully autonomous race later this year is unlikely.
Update: I learned from a Roborace spokesperson that after I had to leave the track on Saturday, the DevBot did complete a lap without a human in the car. It also completed several autonomous laps in a row on Sunday afternoon.

Waymo has provided some additional visibility into how it goes about testing its autonomous vehicle tech in extreme heat, describing a process of stress testing its Chrysler Pacifica minivans that began nearly a year ago, starting with a controlled internal wind tunnel that can replicate the hottest temperatures ever on record in the U.S.
That kicked off a road trip that included heat testing in as many deriving scenarios as possible, all under the hottest conditions available in the U.S. So Waymo tested stop-and-go traffic performance, long ideas, operating on aggressively sloped roads – and even monitoring cabin controls as well as the state of its self-driving software and the exterior of the vehicle using onboard sensors.
In a blog post, Waymo says that it’s currently performing a lot of these tests in Death Valley, where temperatures on record have hit as high as 134°F, or hot enough to melt the rubber of your shoes on sun-baked pavement.

The tests paid off, however, with a much-needed confirmation of Waymo’s closed environment testing – its in-house designed sensor hardware, as well as its onboard autonomous driving computers, are road ready for extreme heat. The company now seems confident that even in the highest temps users would be likely to encounter on real roads, with A/C maxed out, their autonomous systems will behave as desired.
Waymo has been working on self-driving cars for about a decade now, with its original development and testing done when it was Google’s self-driving car project. The work they’re doing now is all about detail, consumer-grade road readiness and edge cases, which is what makes high heat success such an interesting milestone.

203,Vayyar launches 3D sensors that give self-driving cars interior awareness,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/13/vayyar-launches-3d-sensors-that-give-self-driving-cars-interior-awareness/,2017/07/13,"
A lot of the sensor hardware being developed by component suppliers in the autonomous driving industry focus on getting a clear picture of what’s happening outside the car, but Vayyar’s new 3D sensors provide a detailed look inside the car, including information about passengers. The 3D sensor tech also doesn’t use any optical image capture, so it’s better from a privacy perspective than cameras, and they can work in any lighting as a result, too.
These embedded sensors are also small and low-cost compared to other sending solutions, and can provide real-time info about what’s going on in a car, including monitoring passenger vital signs, and even keeping track of whether a driver is nodding off behind the wheel. The potential for Level 2 and Level 3 autonomy here is huge, since the sensors could potentially be used to help monitor driver attentiveness and ensure they’re alerted when they need to be actively monitoring the car and the road.
Autonomous cars could also use the tech to optimize safety, deploying appropriate airbags tailored to the actual vehicle’s passengers and positions in case of an accident. Future autonomous car in-vehicle services could also make use of the tech, tailoring display and delivery of info on in-car displays and modifying environment controls, for instance.

Vayyar also notes that the sensors can be used to automatically detect and send information about survivors within a vehicle in case of accidents, potentially giving emergency responders an early leg up.
Beyond interior monitoring, the 3D sensors created by Vayyar also have applications in terms of monitoring the area immediately surrounding the vehicle, “removing all blind spots” according to the company. They work regardless of light levels, and environmental obstructions like fog or extreme heat, again giving them advantages over optical sensing hardware.
Vayyar has some strong expertise backing its products, too, including CEO and co-founder Raviv Melamed, who was previously VP of Intel’s Architecture Groupu and the GM of its Worldwide Mobile Wireless Group.

BMW is doing more with partner Microsoft to bring productivity to its vehicles. After adding Office 365 communications features to its BMW 5 series late last year, it’s now also bringing Skype for Business to its infotainment features, making it possible for users to connect to Skype meetings in the car.
The Skype integration is going to be integrated into BMW’s iDrive system, and will allow users to join online meetings directly, as well as receive alerts about upcoming meetings, get alerts when meetings are changed, and start meetings automatically without requiring a driver to do any manual dialing in. Exchange customers will also be able to integrate their calendars, to-do tasks and contacts with vehicle voice and navigation services, Microsoft said.
To begin with, the services are going to roll out in Germany, France and the U.K., and BMW will then look to expand it to other markets. It’s a prime example of the delicate balance automakers and connected service providers need to tread when satisfying customer demand for more smart vehicle features, but also focusing on keeping distractions to a minimum.
This partnership also lays the groundwork for long-term collaboration on in-car experiences that could become much more far-reaching when autonomous vehicles become commonplace. Audi already announced it would be bringing Level 3 autonomy to production vehicles next year, which means they’ll be times during driving when a driver can focus on other tasks – including productivity.
Expect more partnerships to emerge like this one that lay the groundwork for deeper integrations in a self-driving future.

205,Cortica teaches autonomous vehicles with unsupervised learning,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/13/cortica-teaches-autonomous-vehicles-with-unsupervised-learning/,2017/07/13,"
Cortica is moving into mobility by opening an automotive branch for its AI technology. The key, according to the company, is in the use of unsupervised learning that allows an autonomous system to process data and figure out its environment.
For those just dipping their toes into the artificial intelligence pool, supervised machine learning is when the AI is given a set of examples and what they mean so that it can learn to recognize similar items in the future. For example, you could feed the system a thousand images of stop signs — some faded, some obscured by tree branches, etc. — so that the AI can learn to recognize stop signs.
In unsupervised machine learning, the examples aren’t labeled. The AI has to classify and organize the examples based on common characteristics. Stop signs, for example, are red with white borders and eight sides. The AI can learn as it goes that sometimes that red is faded and sometimes a white border will be obscured by a tree branch, but it can make changes as needed to classify stop signs as stop signs.
Cortica says unsupervised machine learning will allow autonomous cars of the future to better adapt to new situations on the road. The system Cortica developed to help manufacturers and developers takes in all the data from the sensors, processes the images, clusters them, and tags them with metadata that has already been defined. Igal Raichelgauz, Cortica’s CEO and cofounder, said in a press release that this system can process the massive amounts of data that will soon be generated by in-vehicle cameras — “enough video data to equal YouTube’s entirety every hour” in California alone.
In order to process this volume of data, the system uses a cloud/local hybrid architecture. “Non-vital” processing is offloaded to the cloud to reduce complexity and power consumption, which could become more of a factor as vehicles become more electrified and less reliant on gasoline.
The company says that this kind of machine learning is closer to the way humans see and process visuals. We can recognize a stop sign even when it’s covered in stickers, even in the rain, even at twilight. Cortica’s AI can also adapt to what it calls “next generation obstacles,” including gestures, to predict the intent of other vehicles and humans.
If you’d like to see four minutes or so of AI learning to maneuver around city buses and not hit pedestrians in Tel Aviv crosswalks, here’s a video. It’s kind of reassuringly boring.

206,A new transportation-focused fund just landed $120 million from a wide range of transport companies,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/12/a-new-transportation-focused-fund-just-landed-120-million-from-a-wide-range-of-transport-companies/,2017/07/12,"
Transportation is a huge category. Just some of the players include automakers and motorcycle manufacturers and trucking firms and logistics companies and dealership groups and repair shop chains and truck rental companies and car leasing companies and telematics companies and energy companies with big networks of gasoline stations around the world.
Given the dramatic changes underway in the way that people travel, you can imagine these industries are acutely interested in knowing what technologies are on the horizon so they can adapt and adjust their strategies.
Enter Autotech Ventures, a three-year-old, Bay Area-based venture fund that’s focused on ground transportation startups and which is promising its limited partners — most of them transportation companies — introductions to the latest and greatest startups.
It’s also offering to make key connections for the startups that make room for it at the table.
The firm’s vertical approach is reminiscent of Fifth Wall Ventures, a real-estate focused fund that recently raised its debut fund from a long line of heavyweights in the real-estate world who also want access to the tech that might impact their industry.
Autotech’s strategy is seemingly working already. The firm, which is today announcing the close of its debut fund with $120 million in capital commitments, has already funded six companies, including the growing rideshare giant Lyft.
Lyft fit perfectly into the criteria of Autotech, which looks to back either very early-stage companies where its introductions can make a meaningful impact, or relatively mature deals, where it can “make money off little risk in a relatively short amount of time,” says co-founder Alexei Andreev, a physicist turned longtime investor. He founded Autotech with Quin Garcia, a self-described “car guy” whose past roles have included heading up automotive alliances on behalf of the now defunct electric vehicle network startup Better Place.
At the same time, Autotech made sense for Lyft, too, explains Andreev, who says Autotech joined the company’s December 2015 Series F round, buying primary shares.
“Companies know that we leverage our LPs to help us understand pain points, then we help startups to scale up by introducing them to our LPs,” he says.
Among the other startups in Autotech’s portfolio are DeepScale, a startup developing technology that processes the information a car receives about its surroundings from sensors; Outdoorsy, which is akin to an Airbnb for recreational vehicles; Work Truck Solutions, whose software helps owners of commercial truck fleets track their vehicles; Volta Charging, an EV charging startup that gives away electricity, making money by selling advertising space on the stations; and a logistics platform company called Realign Technology.
Garcia and Andreev say they’re on the cusp on signing two more deals, too.
Altogether, they plan to invest their fund in roughly 15 to 20 startups.
Garcia says that when the duo — who met several years ago through mutual friends — first began talking with investors, they went to some more traditional sources of venture capital funding first. The reactions they heard time and again were, “Transportation, really?” says Garcia.
What a difference a couple of years make. In addition to strategic LPs, the firm says it also raised money from family offices and other wealthy individuals who, in the end, provided the firm with more capital than it was looking to raise. “An onslaught of exits and giants entering the space — Google, Amazon, Apple — it changed everything,” says Garcia. “You definitely don’t have to explain ‘why transportation?’ anymore.”

207,Nvidia is powering the world’s first Level 3 self-driving production car,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/12/nvidia-is-powering-the-worlds-first-level-3-self-driving-production-car/,2017/07/12,"
Audi announced Tuesday that its forthcoming A8 would be the first production vehicle to ship with a Level 3 self-driving feature onboard when it goes on sale next year, and now we know that Nvidia’s technology will be helping power the vehicle’s ‘traffic jam pilot’ autonomous capabilities. Nvidia’s going to be powering a lot in the new A8, in fact – the car has six Nvidia processors helping power not only traffic jam pilot, but also its infotainment system, virtual cockpit instrumentation and headrest tablets for backseat passengers on fully equipped models.
The introduction of Level 3 autonomy on the A8 will mean that drivers don’t have to pay attention to the road in certain conditions – specifically in this case when the car is driving 37 mph or under on a highway with a physical divider. If the vehicle meets those conditions, and local laws allow, drivers can do whatever else is legally allowed behind the wheel, and the system will let them know when it’s time to resume manual control.
That’s a step further than current highway driving assistance features like Tesla’s Autopilot, which is classified as a Level 2 system and requires a driver to be paying attention and ready to resume control at all times. But it’s also designed primarily for sitting in traffic, whereas Autopilot is designed for a range of speeds in highway driving scenarios.
Nvidia’s processor is the “brain” of Audi’s zFAS system, which is the computer that handles driver assistance onboard the A8, and that takes sensor data gathered from the vehicle’s radar, camera, laser scanning and ultrasound sensors to create a fused picture of the road with a range of different types of data. The zFAS decides how the car behaves when traffic jam pilot is engaged, processing data at a rate of 2.5 billion inputs per second.
Level 3 autonomy is somewhat controversial in the self-driving world because it both allows a driver to relax their attention and yet also can’t handle driving operations of the car entirely, as a Level 4 vehicle could. Audi must be very confident in the A8’s abilities with traffic jam pilot to bring this to market, and Nvidia’s tech has a lot riding on a smooth deployment once it does go to market.

208,Here’s how the Tesla Model 3 changed from prototype to production car,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/11/heres-how-the-tesla-model-3-changed-from-prototype-to-production-car/,2017/07/11,"
Curious about what exactly has changed on the Tesla Model 3 now that we have our first look at the production vehicle? The original prototype was revealed back in May 2016, and it’s changed a bit since that pre-alpha design was shown off to a crowd at Tesla’s Hawthorne Design Studio.
The design team at PartCatalog.com have created a visual that makes it easy to spot the differences, and see what’s changed in the intervening year and a bit in terms of the Model 3’s design lines. In the GIF above, the light-colored Model 3 is the pre-alpha prototype, and the black one is Elon Musk’s personal first production Model 3.
It’s true that the final design is very close to what we saw with the pre-alpha prototype, but the lights appear visibly changed, and the PartCatalog folks note that either the car is also longer overall, or the back passenger door is slightly smaller than in the original.
Slight geometry changes are to be expected in development cycles for vehicles like this one, even during that final year heading into production, so it’s not that surprising. Still, interesting to see how the design evolved over time.

209,"Transfix keeps on truckin’, with $42 million in fresh funding led by NEA",https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/11/transfix-keeps-on-truckin-with-42-million-in-fresh-funding-led-by-nea/,2017/07/11,"
When we last checked in on Transfix in late 2015, the then two-year-old, 26-person, New York-based transportation startup was determined to use its tech to increasingly match customers needing interstate freight shipping with truck drivers needing to make deliveries.
It wanted to cut out wasted travel, not to mention greenhouse gas emissions.
The company has been chugging along ever since, evidently. Transfix, which now employs 110 people, just closed on $42 million in Series C funding led by previous backer New Enterprise Associates, with participation from unnamed strategic investors with “strong ties to the retail and logistics world,” says the company.
Altogether, it has now raised $78.5 million, including from earlier backers Canvas Ventures, Lerer Hippeau Ventures and Bowery Capital.
What do these investors get for their investment? Transfix says its fleet management system does a whole lot of things, including enables users to track shipments, SMS drivers, receive alerts when a shipment will be delayed and calculate drivers’ fuel taxes. It says its transaction time is now almost half what it was back in 2015, too.
The company has also more recently launched an online marketplace platform so carriers can ostensibly select loads in a more efficient way based on the price they prefer, rather than merely allowing Transfix to make a match for them as it had in the past.
And it says it has also made progress in its ability to integrate more seamlessly with large enterprise customers when it comes to executing their shipments, working with their contracted carriers, and otherwise offering visibility into and analysis about their own supply chains.
We asked Transfix about paying truckers ahead of when vendors would pay them. When we’d last spoken, it was a small but growing part of the company’s business, and at least one competitor, Trucker Path, recently lined up $30 million in debt to lend to truckers on its platform.
Might Transfix also be doubling down on its lending business? Is that where the money is?
CTO Jonathan Salama says that one in five carriers sign up for Transfix’s “quick pay program,” which collects 2 percent as a convenience fee. But he declines to dive into many other specifics, saying instead that the company “feels strongly about supporting our truck driver partners and feels this is a great way to help them in a way that is meaningful to them” but that it’s “not a major source of revenue for the company.”
He adds that historically, Transfix has funded that particular service itself, but it is “very aware of the other options available to us in the market.”
As for competition more broadly — the trucking space has gotten just a little more crowded than the last time we’d spoken — Salama says Transfix is “acutely aware that there are other companies making strides in what is a very large market, where different buyers with different problems are looking for different solutions.”
With that said, he adds, “We think our vision of eliminating significant waste throughout the supply chain is of value for any large shipper, as well as any trucking company.”
Put another way, Transfix plans to yes, keep on trucking, no matter how many companies get in its lane.
That fresh $42 million should help.

210,"Bye-bye, Firefly: Waymo retires its autonomous prototype vehicle",https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/11/bye-bye-firefly-waymo-retires-its-autonomous-prototype-vehicle/,2017/07/11,"
If you were holding out for one of those super-cute autonomous pods from Google’s early days of researching self-driving vehicles, I have bad news. The autonomous division of the company is now Waymo (that’s not the bad news), and it announced that it is retiring the little white vehicles, known as “Firefly” inside the company. That, for those of us who liked the little gumdrop on wheels, is the bad news.
In a blog post, Waymo lead industrial designer YooJung Ahn and lead systems engineer Jaime Waydo pointed out that the koala-faced car was never intended for mass production. It was designed in 2013 so that the team could learn how a car without a steering wheel or pedals would even work. That’s how Waymo figured out that the sensors could see more and process data more efficiently if they were all together in a dome on top of the roof. By 2015, Firefly could take a fully autonomous drive with a blind man inside and no human backup.
But the Firefly had some drawbacks, like a top speed of 25 mph. That’s great when you’re working out the very basics of autonomous driving, but it’s not enough for most real-world streets. There were only about 50 Fireflies in the fleet at best, and while they racked up millions of miles of test drives, that’s still not enough.
And so the Firefly will live out its life in museums around the world, including the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, and the Design Museum in London. A pretty cushy retirement for a robot.
Waymo will press on, of course, with a far bigger fleet in number and vehicle size. It’s using 600 Chrysler Pacifica minivans that can travel at normal speeds and have all the things people usually want in cars, like more than two seats, in its latest tests. If you live in the Phoenix, Arizona, metro area, you can join Waymo’s Early Rider Program to take these vehicles to the places you normally go, like work or school.

211,Audi’s new A8 will have Level 3 autonomy via ‘traffic jam pilot’,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/11/audis-new-a8-will-have-level-3-autonomy-via-traffic-jam-pilot/,2017/07/11,"
The new Audi A8 revealed by the automaker today features a new level of self-driving for production vehicles – Level 3 autonomy, which actually allows drivers to stop monitoring the vehicle under certain conditions – and where allowed by law to do so. Level 3 is one that some autonomous experts have argued shouldn’t even exist, since it requires a driver to still be ready to resume control, but Audi’s production implementation of the tech is on its way regardless.
The A8’s new automated driving feature is called “traffic jam pilot,” and kicks in when the car finds itself in slow-moving traffic on divided highways at speeds of 37.3 mph and under only. That’s very different from Level 2 highway assistance features like Tesla’s Autopilot, and it’s clearly intended to mitigate any risks associated with use of the system. But it’s also a feature that sounds very attractive from a user perspective, since it handles driving in those conditions where it’s not at all fun to have manual control – amid stop-and-go freeway traffic.
Traffic jam pilot handles all aspects of driving in these conditions, including starting from a stop, accelerating, steering and braking. Drivers can take their hands off the wheel entirely, and (where legal) can even text, watch the built-in TV or read. The system is designed to alert the driver in plenty of time to get them to resume manual control where necessary.
That’s a tough needle to thread, which is why some experts and automakers, including Ford, have said they’re skipping Level 3 entirely and heading straight to Level 4, where the vehicle assumes full control of all driving operations. Audi clearly has a lot of confidence in its solution, which is powered by a central driver assistance controller that’s computing a sensor fusion image of the vehicle’s surroundings based on data from radar, front camera, ultrasonics and laser scanning.
Rollout of traffic jam pilot will vary based on testing and approvals as required market-to-market, so this could be variably available when the A8 ships. Still, it’ll a big step forward in autonomy when it does make it to consumers.
The A8 also includes AI-based remote parking for both surface spaces and garages, which don’t even require the driver to be seated in the car to both hail and send the vehicle to its spot. All of that is controlled via a mobile app for the driver’s smartphone. Audi could find itself at the leading edge of autonomy with the A8, but being this close to the frontier mean it’ll be closely monitored for risk, too.

212,Tesla to triple service capability with repair fleet and service center expansion,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/11/tesla-to-triple-service-capability-with-repair-fleet-and-service-center-expansion/,2017/07/11,"

Tesla is adding over 100 new service centers around the world, and putting over 350 new mobile service vans to work with its roaming fleet for house and work calls. The goal is to increase its service capacity threefold overall, as a way to help get ready for the new demand that’s going to flow from the many new Model 3 customers joining the Tesla owner pool in the future.
The automaker says it’s rethinking how service happens at a basic level, using the remote diagnostic capabilities of its automobiles to help identify up to 90 percent of issues before a car ever needs to even visit a physical service center. This helps them save time when visits do need to happen at the centers themselves, and also means they’ll be able to avoid some entirely with remote service or remote software updates.

To help plot where to put its new global service centers, Tesla looked at the information of where Model 3 pre-order customers were located, and it’s also putting more repair lanes in each to help increase their speed and efficiency. Tesla claims its service centers are up to four times faster than traditional garages, using three times less space.
As for its on-demand service vans, these are actually equipped with espresso machines, activities for kids and snack stations for customers, and they don’t incur any additional cost vs. a traditional in-shop appointment, so it’s a win for both Tesla and customers in terms of maximizing efficiency and convenience.
Tesla also says it’s hiring 1,400 new service technicians on board in 2017, so adding capacity is a job creation mechanism, too. The real test will be once production on Model 3 really ramps and customers start testing the actual capacity for real, however – that likely won’t start to happen until next year, based on Tesla’s current production roadmap.

213,Faraday Future is one step closer to the deadpool,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/10/faraday-future-is-one-step-closer-to-the-deadpool/,2017/07/10,"
Faraday Future might as well pack it up and call it a day. The company has reportedly abandoned plans to build a massive factory in the Nevada desert. This facility was going to cost $1 billion to build and employ 13,000 people. The state of Nevada awarded the company massive tax breaks to get the project done. The Nevada state governor even has a ceremonial shovel for the project hanging in his office. According to The Nevada Independent, he’s going to take down the shovel because the factory is not going to happen.
Instead of building this sprawling factory of the future, the company will now reportedly build a much smaller facility. This is the second factory the company has announced that would not be built.
To bring you up to speed, Faraday Future came out of nowhere several years ago and unveiled a wild concept at CES 2016. When I say wild, I really mean dumb. Because that’s what it was. This year at CES the company unveiled the FF 91, a near-production concept car that was closer to its production plans and claimed it was faster than a Tesla Model S and packed with more gizmos and gadgets. The company also said the car would go into production in 2018.
Between unveiling the two concept vehicles, the company fought lawsuits and losing executives.
“We have decided to put a hold on our factory at the Apex site in North Las Vegas. We remain committed to the Apex site in Las Vegas for long-term vehicle manufacturing,” Stefan Krause, Faraday Future’s chief financial officer told the Independent in a statement. “We at Faraday Future are significantly shifting our business strategy to position the company as the leader in user-ship personal mobility — a vehicle usage model that reimagines the way users access mobility. As a result of this shift in direction, we are in the final stages of confirming a new manufacturing facility that presents a faster path to start-of-production and aligns with future strategic options.”
Faraday Future is reliant on LeEco for financial backing, a Chinese tech giant that can’t stop losing money. The company that was once considered the Netflix of China seemingly expanded too fast away from its core competencies to automobiles, TVs and electric bikes. LeEco tried to raise cash and eventually found a large investment from Sunac, but that apparently wasn’t enough to maintain the growth. CEO Jia Yueting said last month that the cash problem was “far worse than expected.”
Even without LeEco’s financial woes, Faraday Future would have struggled on its own. The company never passed the smell test. There was also something funny about Faraday Future. The company’s executives seemingly spent most of their time on marketing concept vehicles. It was a hype machine that created a legion of rabid fans.
I doubt the company will ever put a vehicle into production. Even in the best of times, building a vehicle from scratch is hard. That’s why Tesla tapped Lotus for half of its first car. Essentially Faraday Future is skipping the minimum viable product phase of startups, and as many founders can attest, that’s the wrong way to do it.

214,Waymo’s self-driving minivans get some emergency vehicle training time,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/10/waymos-self-driving-minivans-get-some-emergency-vehicle-training-time/,2017/07/10,"
Waymo’s self-driving Pacifica minivans recently got a dedicated testing day with the Chandler, Ariz. Fire & Police Department, wherein the autonomous vehicles spent time in focused demo runs where firetrucks, police cars, motorcycles, ambulances and more navigated streets in and around the Waymo vehicles.
This test was the “first emergency vehicle testing day” Waymo has run with its new vehicles (they’re exposed to them in the course of the ordinary vehicle road trials, of course, but this is the first dedicated day around this testing). The goal was to collect as much sensor data as possible regarding the emergency vehicles, and how they sound and look as they pass, lead and trail behind the autonomous cars



The resulting data helps form a library from which Waymo can pull when training its vehicles on the proper behavior and set of responses to use when encountering ambulances and the like on real roads – obviously a key ingredient that needs to be addressed before public road tests can become commercial service deployments.

The new hardware on the Pacificas, which Waymo developed entirely in-house, includes audio sensors that can detect sirens up to twice as far away as the original set, Google says. The new vision, radar and LiDAR equipment can also see emergency vehicles further out than they were able to before, which helps explain why Waymo wanted to do a first day of dedicated testing with the new equipment: It’s going to be better able to observe emergency vehicle behavior in real-time and model appropriate paths and responses with this new kit.
Waymo’s currently using Chandler and Phoenix as test beds for its initial autonomous on-demand passenger pick-up service, but the data gathered from these local tests will help its self-driving software more generally be able to recognize even emergency vehicles it hasn’t encountered before, and react appropriately.

215,The Lucid Air tops 235 mph in new high-speed performance test,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/10/the-lucid-air-tops-235-mph-in-new-high-speed-performance-test/,2017/07/10,"

One of Lucid’s prototype Air vehicles returned to the Transportation Research Facility’s oval race track recently for a second round of high-speed performance testing – and this time, it ran the tests without a software speed limiter in place.
The first time around, said speed limiter meant that the Air prototype never exceeded speeds of 217 mph; without that limiter in place, it went up to 235 mph during this new round of testing. Based on what Lucid learned from that first test, they took their high speed prototype back to the shop and made some improvements.
Those tweaks include a software update to improve the car’s air suspension system performance under heavy load, and more cooling for the front motor, which ran hotter than expected.
With these changes, the team felt confident in doing a run without the limiter in place, and achieved a max top speed of 235.44 mph coming off the track’s banking oval through the straightaway. Lucid notes that this isn’t the final production top speed for the car, but it is impressive as heck nonetheless.

It’s here: The first ever production Model 3 has rolled off Tesla’s assembly line and into the possession of its owner – Elon Musk. The founder and CEO tweeted pictures of the new vehicle, which he only got because the actual first pre-order customer gifted Musk his place in the queue as a birthday present.
Alongside the pics, Musk tweeted an interesting bit of trivia about who gets dibs on the first edition of any new Tesla car: It’s the first person who pays full price for the vehicle. Musk earned that honor for the Roadster and Model X, but not for the Model S, he noted.

This first production Model 3 is black, a good callback to the original Model T from Ford, which famously came in any color you wanted as long as it was black. The Model 3 will have more paint options, but it’s one of the very few things customers will be able to customize on the vehicle, as Tesla is limiting options early to ease the production process.
As expected based on prototype models and early spy shots of the car, it basically looks like a shorter Model S, but with a similar sporty feel for a four-door sedan. Musk’s big reveal didn’t go long on technical details, however, so we’re still waiting on some of that info, including the exact range beyond the minimum 215 mile spec, for example.
Tesla noted recently that its first customers beyond Musk can expect deliveries to start around July 28, so that’s the date to look for more info.
Bonus: here is another new photo of the Model 3.

217,Waymo drops most patent claims in Uber self-driving car lawsuit,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/07/waymo-drops-patent-claims/,2017/07/07,"
There were a few big breaks in the case between Waymo and Uber over self-driving car technology today. As a result, the scope of the case is starting to come into focus as both companies prepare for a trial set to begin in October.
First of all, Waymo has narrowed its case, dropping three out of four patent claims it originally made against Uber. Meanwhile, Uber has been granted the ability to depose Alphabet CEO Larry Page about why his company decided against partnering with Uber as part of its autonomous vehicle program.
Waymo, the self-driving technology arm of Google parent Alphabet, filed the lawsuit in February, alleging theft of trade secrets that Uber planned to use in its autonomous vehicles. The case centers around engineer Anthony Levandowski, who Waymo claims stole 14,000 documents before leaving the company and founding Otto, a self-driving trucking company which Uber later acquired.
Waymo decided to drop its claims on U.S. Patent Nos. 8,836,922, 9,285,464 and 9,086,273, noting that they were related to an earlier version of Uber’s autonomous lidar design nicknamed “Spider” that the company was no longer using. The remaining patent claim targets a newer version of lidar technology called Fiji, which is still in use by Uber.
An Uber spokesperson issued the following statement: “Waymo’s retreat on three of their four patent claims is yet another sign that they have overpromised and can’t deliver. Not only have they uncovered zero evidence of any of the 14,000 files in question coming to Uber, they now admit that Uber’s LiDAR design is actually very different than theirs. Faced with this hard truth, Waymo has resorted to floating conspiracy theories not rooted in fact, doing everything they can to put the focus on sensation rather than substance.”
In addition to the patent news, U.S. District Judge William Alsup asked Waymo to narrow its theft of trade secret claims from more than 100 down to 10 that could be put in front of a jury.
Over the course of the last several months, the judge has urged both parties to simplify the scope of the case so that each could be adequately prepared to argue the merits of the strongest claims post-discovery. This has been happening at the same time that Uber and Waymo have been arguing over what evidence can be admitted during the trial.
On that front, U.S. Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley, who has been overseeing the discovery process of the case, granted Uber’s lawyers the ability to depose Alphabet CEO Larry Page ahead of trial. Those lawyers are expected to question Page over why the company chose not to partner with Uber, a company it had invested in, as part of its autonomous driving efforts.
The company also seeks to depose Alphabet chief legal officer David Drummond, who served as a board member to Uber from August 2013 through August 2016. Corley ruled that Uber also will be able to depose Drummond, unless Waymo plans to call him as a witness.
Waymo, for its part, continues to argue that Uber was aware of the confidential information Levandowski took before leaving Google. In a statement issued today, a spokesperson said:
“Anthony Levandowski led Uber’s self-driving car program for over a year after stealing 14,000 confidential Waymo files. While Uber has decided it is now advantageous to disavow him, the truth is Uber supported Levandowski’s 5th Amendment claims to avoid self-incrimination well into this litigation and continues to obstruct the production of key documents every step of the way. We initiated legal action because we came across evidence showing stolen Waymo files made their way into Uber’s technology, and despite Uber’s attempt to distract with constantly changing storylines, Waymo has continued to build its case with more evidence uncovered during expedited discovery. We look forward to sharing this evidence in court.”

Just one day after we found out that Volvo intends to stop selling cars with exclusively internal combustion engine drivetrains by 2019, France’s minister of the environment Nicolas Hulot has detailed a plan to the Financial Times for the country that includes ending the sale of fossil fuel-powered cars by 2040. The effective ban will be achieved through a mix of financial incentives for alternative fuel vehicles, and increased taxes on older, internal combustion cars.
France’s environmental plan also includes instituting a carbon tax, and ending the issuance of new licenses for discovering new local sources of oil. They’ll also incentivize renewable energy creation, according to Engadget, which should help make sure that EVs are powered by a grid that itself is mostly stocked by green energy sources, for a cleaner power picture at the macro level.
Like London Mayor Sadiq Khan’s plan to make transport in the city totally emission free by 2050, this is a plan at this stage, not anything binding. But France’s government has the power to back it up with legislation given time, so during this administration at least, expect these plans to start resulting in some action.

219,Tesla drops 7% after Goldman Sachs says the stock is worth $180,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/05/tesla-drops-7-after-goldman-sachs-says-the-stock-is-worth-180/,2017/07/05,"
If you follow Tesla’s performance in public markets you’re no doubt aware of the ongoing bull versus bear battle between analysts who follow the company.
While analysts from major investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Bank of America typically disagree (to a certain extent) on future price targets for stocks, it’s much rarer for analysts to be totally split on if a company’s stock will go up or down.
And this is just what’s happening with Tesla. Out of 24 analysts who publicly disclose their Tesla forecasts, eight say you should buy the stock or that it’s overweight (meaning they think it will go up), and eight think it’s underweight or you should sell it (meaning they think it will go down). And eight more just say to hold — essentially saying it will perform similarly to the overall market.
Specifically, the lowest price target from the group is $155 from Cowen, and the highest is $464 per share from Berenberg.
The average of these targets is $281.79, which is still a lot lower than the current price of $327.09 that the stock settled at after a 7 percent drop today.

So why did the stock drop today? A few reasons:
Yesterday Tesla announced they delivered 22,000 cars in Q2 2017. While this puts them on track to beat their 2016 year-long deliveries of 76,000, it’s less than expected, which Tesla attributed to a “severe production shortfall of 100 kWh battery packs.”
And this morning, Goldman Sachs dropped their price target from $190 to $180 on concerns that demand for the older Model S and Model X cars have plateaued and Tesla will have trouble meeting upcoming production goals.
Of course, Tesla’s main focus right now is on the more affordable Model 3, which will ship at the end of this month. And while only 100 cars will be produced in August, Elon Musk says there will be 20,000 made per month by December and 500,000 cars per year in 2018.
The real reason for such a disconnect between analysts is that people see Tesla as two different things. One way to look at Tesla is like it’s a traditional car company — and if you value it by that industry standard, it’s absolutely overvalued.
But others see Tesla as a technology and energy company rooted in its self-driving and battery production technology, which could mean that Tesla is currently only a fraction of the size it could grow it.
Whichever theory you subscribe to, we can all agree it’s going to be an interesting couple of months as Tesla ramps up Model 3 production and tries to prove it can finally roll out a car on a mass-market scale.

220,Torc Robotics unveils self-driving system for consumer cars,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/05/torc-robotics-unveils-self-driving-system-for-consumer-cars/,2017/07/05,"
Another new entrant has joined the field of those offering self-driving tech to consumer carmakers — but this one likely has a bit more experience than most. Virginia-based Torc Robotics has been working on autonomous vehicle tech since 2007, when it finished third in the DARPA Urban Challenge, and it has applied autonomy in a range of commercial, industrial and military applications.
Now Torc is setting its sights on the consumer car market, with a self-driving car project based on its decade of experience, with more than 1,000 miles logged of autonomous driving in recent tests using two modified Lexus RX vehicles. These have been active on roads since February 2017, driving in “all weather” conditions according to Torc, and equipped with Torc’s in-house localization, mapping, navigation and object detection/tracking systems.
One of Torc’s test vehicles performed a demonstration long-distance drive, making the 1,000 mile round trip from their Virginia HQ to Ford’s Piquette Avenue Plant in Detroit — a symbolic debut voyage to the heart of U.S. car country and the birthplace of the original Model T.
Why now for the automotive push? Torc CEO Michael Fleming told me that the time is finally right, both in terms of the state of available technology, but also in terms of the appetite for autonomous products from consumer automakers — which weren’t always as eager to develop and invest in self-driving.
“What we’ve found is that were some other markets that were early adopters to this technology, and there wasn’t a great deal of interest in the automotive industry coming out of the DARPA Challenge,” explained Fleming. “Google is really the early adopter of this technology, with some key folks from the Carnegie Mellon and Stanford teams from 10 years ago, and they’ve done some great marketing, and they’ve been on the forefront of this technology in the automotive space.”

Fleming clearly gives Google a lot of credit in terms of its role popularizing autonomous driving and making it a more familiar, comfortable subject for public discussion. But I wondered if Google’s own efforts to build a comprehensive self-driving system (now under Alphabet’s Waymo) might not inhibit Torc’s ability to operate in the same market.
“Our role is more of an enabler,” Fleming said. “We work with OEMs, tier 1s and tier 2s in the automotive space, taking our 10 years of experience and working with these organizations, outlining their road map moving forward. This is fairly new technology to a lot of the players in the automotive space, but this is something we’ve been doing every day for the last 10 years, and we’ve tried just about every combination of technology, so we knows what works and what doesn’t work.”
Torc can act as a sort of “guide” helping players new to the space navigate the hype that is omnipresent in autonomous driving tech, Fleming says. But in addition to roadmapping, Torc also aims to integrate its own platforms with those of clients and partners bringing commercially viable self-driving tech to market. In other words, it sees itself as one of a number of partners working together, which fits with the current model being embraced by most automotive OEs.
Fleming says we can expect to hear more from Torc on the autonomous car front in the coming months, including updates regarding its technology and partners. It’s early days yet for its consumer automotive business, but it does possess a rare thing in the burgeoning market: experience.

221,BMW’s i3 battery now being used for Torqeedo’s electric boat motors,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/05/bmws-i3-battery-now-being-used-for-torqeedos-electric-boat-motors/,2017/07/05,"
BMW’s i3 high-capacity batteries, which it uses in its i3 compact electric vehicle, has applications beyond BMW’s own – case in point, the car maker is now supplying German boat propulsion system company Torqeedo with i3 batteries for its Deep Blue aquatic electric drive systems.
The Torqeedo systems provide motorboats with hybrid and electric propulsion ranging from 1 to 160 HP in capacity, and BMW says the adoption of its tech by the company is a testament to its ability to produce high voltage batteries for a range of applications in transport efficiency. The current version of the i3 battery has 44kWh capacity, providing 50 more charge with the same size and weight of the previous generation.

BMW designed i3 batteries to have ‘plug-and-play’ functionality, with in-house connectors, cables, sensors and temperature control systems in addition to the 12 cells found in each of the battery’s eight modules. The automaker intended from the outset to make the batteries usable in a range of different applications, including, for example, as energy storage in commercial power generation, where they can be useful even after they’ve passed their usable life in terms of powering vehicles.
A recent study found that the electric boat market would be worth $20 billion by 2027, so this is a market with huge growth potential for BMW, and Torqeedo is a partner that can help adapt their tech to a wide range of nautical applications.

222,Volvo will only make electric and hybrid cars starting in 2019,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/05/volvo-will-only-make-electric-and-hybrid-cars-starting-in-2019/,2017/07/05,"
Volvo is done with entirely traditional engines and exclusively gas-powered vehicles, the company announced. By 2019, Volvo group intends to offer only either fully electric or hybrid engines on all new models, making it the first automaker to commit to using only alternative drive trains.
The end of the solely combustion engine-powered car did seem like an eventual inevitability, given the advantages of electric and hybrid from a manufacturing and performance standpoint, and given the industry’s heavy investment in autonomous vehicle tech. But for Volvo to commit to going entirely hybrid and electric just two years from now is still the strongest sign yet we’ve seen that the purely combustion engine’s days might be numbered sooner, rather than later.
Volvo already had a target sales figure of 1 million electric and hybrid cars by 2025, and now that target seems well within reach given it’s all it’ll be selling in terms of new vehicles. Volvo also announced it would launch five new electric and hybrid cars between 2019 and 2021, and that two of those will be made by Polestar, which the company recently announced would become its own subsidiary and brand selling performance EVs, likely to compete with high-end Tesla models.
Part of the cost benefit of making electric cars is dealing with ever stronger emissions requirements on vehicles, which are set to tighten in most key international markets, including China, which is where Volvo’s owner Geely is based. Production costs of EV parts and batteries are also getting smaller, as capacity and manufacturing processes improve.
Volvo getting a jump on the move to electric, with hybrids included as a transitional stopgap, is a smart and aggressive play for claiming a leadership position in the market of the future. A lot of companies talk about their work with, and commitment to alternative drivetrains, but this is really putting your money where you mouth is.

223,Baidu’s Apollo platform becomes the ‘Android of the autonomous driving industry’,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/05/baidus-apollo-platform-becomes-the-android-of-the-autonomous-driving-industry/,2017/07/05,"
Baidu now claims one of the largest partner ecosystems for an autonomous driving platform in the world: Its Apollo autonomous driving program now counts over 50 partners, including FAW Group, one of the major Chinese carmakers that will work with Baidu on commercialization of the tech. Other partners include Chinese auto companies Chery, Changan and Great Wall Motors, as well as Bosch, Continental, Nvidia, Microsoft Cloud, Velodyne, TomTom, UCAR and Grab Taxi.
The Apollo program (if that name seems familiar, it’s because it’s actually named after the U.S. mission to the moon) also includes five of China’s top universities, and local government tie-ups as well. Baidu’s COO Qi Lu called the platform the “Android of the autonomous driving industry, but more open and powerful,” and it aims to provide developers with tools including data, APIs, open source code for some portions and even reference hardware to help them bring autonomous driving products to market.
To demonstrate what the platform can do, U.S. autonomous system supplier startup AutonomouStuff showed off two cars they turned into self-driving models using Apollo’s 1.0 software release in just three days. These cars ran circuits at a track near Baidu’s AI developer conference, which is where the Apollo program news was announced.
The goal is to open up Apollo’s abilities to developers gradually over time, and this month, developers will get access to driving technologies for specific, restricted areas. By the end of 2020, Baidu hopes to offer a platform that can handle full autonomous driving on both urban roads and highways.
In the autonomous driving industry there have been a lot of partnership announcements, amounting to a sort of ‘musical chairs’ with many players seeking to team up on various aspects of the challenge. In that context, Baidu may have just sat down in all the chairs at once. These partnerships tend to be open, as players hedge their bets and prepare for multiple leaders to emerge in the space, but Baidu’s open approach with the resulting product is interesting and different.
Baidu, as an Internet company with business similar to Google’s, seems to believe that the data and services business resulting from use of its platform will be worth making it more broadly available (the Android model). It’s an interesting approach, and one that could prove a winning strategy, especially in the potentially massive Chinese market.

224,Einride’s T-Pod self-driving transport EV gets a full-scale prototype,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/04/einrides-t-pod-self-driving-transport-ev-gets-a-full-scale-prototype/,2017/07/04,"
Swedish tech startup Einride has built a full-scale prototype of its T-Pod, the electric autonomous transport vehicle it hopes will eventually replace smaller heavy-duty trucks, featuring remote control operation and a 200 kWh energy capacity with a maximum range of around 124 miles.
The Einride T-Pod is unique in its design, as you can see, but it’s designed from the ground up for remote human operation and driverless functioning, meaning you don’t need the traditional crew cabin, and can instead build a vehicle tailor-made exclusively for transporting goods efficiently. The T-Pod will be put into service first in a route between Gothenburg and Helsingborg by 2020 in Sweden, with 200 T-Pods traveling the route, which will be outfitted with charging stations.

The overall T-Pod network will be able to move up to 2,000,000 pallets of goods per year, which Einride says will have roughly the CO2 emissions equivalent of 400,000 passenger cars traveling the equivalent distance. Einride also says it might expand the route even farther earlier than planned, given the strength of client demand.
These T-Pods are an interesting alternative to autonomous retrofit and conversion of semi trucks. The remote control mechanism is also interesting, and Einride says it adds “human flexibility and decision-making” alongside the vehicle’s autonomous capabilities, with one driver able to control multiple T-Pods at once.

225,"Tesla delivered 22K vehicles in Q2, 47K in the first half of 2017",https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/03/tesla-delivered-22k-vehicles-in-q2-47k-in-the-first-half-of-2017/,2017/07/03,"
Tesla has delivered 22,000 cars during the second quarter of 2017, the company revealed today. That includes 12,000 Model S vehicles and 10,000 Model X SUVs, adding up to a 53 percent increase over its delivery numbers for the same period in 2016.
In total across Q1 and Q2 2017, Tesla delivered 47,100 cars, which is on track to beat its 76,000 deliveries for 2016. Tesla’s second-quarter deliveries were hamstrung by a shortage of 100kWh batteries, the company says, which are created using new production-line tech and facilities, leading to new challenges. Tesla says production fell short of demand by roughly 40 percent up until early June, but after that, it managed to deliver the best performance (in terms of both orders and deliveries) in the company’s history.
Tesla says its Model S and Model X deliveries in the second half of 2017 will exceed those made during the first half, and production in Q2 totaled 25,708 cars. Tesla also says that it has added a significant number of test and display Model X cars, as some of its showroom facilities apparently had none at all. The company also notes that production has improved dramatically on Model X, to the point where it “rarely” shows “initial quality problems” on new cars off the line.
Tesla’s deliveries total represents all cars delivered physically to the customer, with all paperwork completed successfully. The company also just announced that it will begin shipping Model 3 to its first 30 or so customers beginning July 28, with the first certified production vehicles being completed by this Friday.

226,Taxis get Square in DC,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/03/taxis-get-square-in-dc/,2017/07/03,"
Washington, D.C. has taken a step to help the city’s taxis remain relevant and compete with ride-hailing apps like Uber and Lyft. As of August 31, 2017, all taxi drivers in the city will have to make the switch from the old meters we all know and hate to new digital meters with payments powered by Square.
By the end of the summer, all taxi drivers will be able to swipe your card the same way local coffee shops and food carts do, with a Square reader plugged into a smartphone or tablet. The city’s Department of For-Hire Vehicles (DFHV) has approved a few meter apps already that drivers can choose to use. Like ride-hailing apps, the new meters will allow for dynamic pricing for passengers who hail a cab from the curb.
Passengers will get fare estimates, GPS route tracking and electronic receipts, just like you would with Uber or Lyft. You won’t have a credit card stored in the app, though. You’ll have to swipe, tap or dip your card or phone to pay the fare using Square when the ride is concluded. You’ll also be able to tip the driver using the app, the same way you do when you pay with Square just about anywhere.
Washington, D.C. is the first city to transition to all digital meters, so it will be interesting to see if the convenience makes a dent in the rise of ride hailing-services there.

Tesla is likely to reveal the first production model of its hotly anticipated Model 3 this week, according to CEO Elon Musk, with the first batch of customers on track to get their vehicles by July 28.
Musk took to Twitter, as he so often does, to reveal that the Model 3 passed its regulatory approvals for production two weeks ahead of time.

The Tesla supremo is targeting July 28 for a handover party for the first 30 (lucky) Tesla 3 owners. Beyond that he said production should ramp up to 20,000 vehicles per month by December, with a more modest output of 100 and 1,500+ expected for August and September.
Musk showed off a release candidate taking its first drive in March, which signaled that production wasn’t too far away, and in April it promised a first look in… July.


Looks like we can reach 20,000 Model 3 cars per month in Dec

Musk has called the Model 3 “a smaller, more affordable” Model S, rather than a radical overhaul, but the $35,000 price tag and quality of performance have generated huge interest, with more than 400,000 pre-orders clocked.
The car was unveiled last year when Tesla tentatively promised to begin delivers by the end of 2017. Spec-wise, the base model will be capable of 0-60 in under six seconds, with at least 215 miles per charge.

Cabin recently announced it had secured $3.3 million in seed financing for its sleeper-car buses. (I’ll explain that concept in a minute.) The funding was led by Founders Fund’s FF Angel, with participation from half a dozen other investors. This new round of funding will enable Cabin to expand its overnight transportation services regionally and nationally.
Now, about that “moving hotel” idea. A full-size travel bus has been outfitted with sleeping berths lining a narrow walkway, like trains used to have. There’s a small communal lounge area for social insomniacs, Wi-Fi for solitary insomniacs and earplugs and nighttime tea for all. There are attendants on hand and a bathroom on board, and each rider can bring two pieces of luggage for free.
Right now, there’s only one route between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Riders are picked up at 11:00 p.m. at a central location, and the bus arrives in the next city by 7:00 a.m. so you can make whatever meeting you have lined up. The price for an overnight ride is $115. One-way flights between those two cities are often less than $100, but with Cabin, you’re paying for a bed and the privilege of not having to fight over the armrest.
Cabin joins companies like Tesloop in creating shared long-distance road travel experiences that are intended to be nicer than, if not as fast as, airline travel. People seem to be interested; Cabin’s 2016 pilot project was called SleepBus, and it sold out all its tickets in three days. The wait list was 20,000 potential customers deep. That’s more than the estimated 15,000 people, according to Cabin, who fly between Los Angeles and San Francisco every day.

Musk and Tesla have previously said that the Model 3 deliveries are set to start in July, at which time we’ll presumably also get more details on the final design and specifications.
Those first deliveries are likely part of an initial low-volume Model 3 production run destined for Tesla’s most faithful insider customers and employees, and will kick off configuration selection for members of the general public holding reservations for production units. Scaled production is set to ramp to a rate of approximately 5,000 vehicles per week by September, according to earlier reports.

Toyota recently wrapped up its first in-home trial in North America of its Human Support Robot platform. The robot, which goes by HSR for short, is one of the mobility assistance bots that the automaker is developing for use in the realm of improving quality of life for everyday people.
Toyota has a range of projects underway targeting improved mobility for users with limited or impaired capacities, including senior citizens. In addition to the HSR, they’re also developing a wearable robotic leg brace that restores walking capabilities to individuals with lower body paralysis, a tech that helps those with sight problems gain improved awareness of their surroundings, and robots that can help with transferring patients under supervised care from bed, to chairs. Closer to its home business, Toyota is also working on a device that can help with entry and exit of car seats for those with limited mobility.
The HSR trial that Toyota just completed in North America was run with U.S. war vet Romy Camargo, who suffered injuries in Afghanistan during his service that left him paralyzed below the neck. The robot is a wheeled affair with visual sensors and an articulating arm appendage, and can assist Camargo and his family by performing simple tasks around the house like opening and closing doors, as well as fetching water bottles and other objects.
Many automakers, including Hyundai, Honda, and more, are exploring research in mobility assistance, last mile solutions and in-home robotics as opportunities for potential future business. Toyota also has Toyota Research Institute, an entire organization devoted to research in the field of AI and robotics for mobility solutions. This trial and others like it could eventually pave the way toward true commercialization of domestic robotics down the road.

231,Chat app Kakao raises $437M for its Korean ride-hailing service,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/30/chat-app-kakao-raises-437m-for-its-korean-ride-hailing-service/,2017/06/30,"
Korea’s Kakao, the country’s top mobile messenger company with some 50 million monthly users, has continued to diversify its business with a move to spin-out the unit managing its mobility services, which include a ride-hailing app that is beating Uber in Korea.
The firm announced that ‘Kakao Mobility’ has now become an independent entity in a move that sees U.S. investment firm TPG put 500 billion KRW, or approximately $437 million, into the business. TPG’s portfolio includes Uber — Kakao Mobility’s most visible rival in Korea — as well as Airbnb and Spotify.
This spin-out is aimed at fostering “swift decision making and aggressive expansion,” said Kakao, which merged with internet giant Daum in a multi-billion dollar deal in 2014.
Kakao’s 36-year-old CEO Jimmy Rim has been under pressure to maintain Kakao’s growth, and he’s opted to empower the firm’s business units. Today’s news comes months after Kakao granted similar independence to its Kakao Pay division, which manages its Kakao Pay mobile payment service and other financial assets. Kakao Pay also took on strategic funding, raising $200 million from Alibaba’s Ant Financial fintech unit.
Kakao Mobility is best-known for its Kakao Taxi service, which launched in Seoul two years ago. It was created in a bid to capitalize on Kakao’s domination in Korea — where it is installed on over 95 percent of smartphones — by going beyond messaging to offer services. Kakao shared that the service currently sees 1.5 million ride requests daily, while the service has expanded to Japan.
Uber has never provided figures for its Korean business, but the country hasn’t been a happy hunting ground for the U.S. firm.
Authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of then-CEO Travis Kalanick in 2014, while UberX was withdrawn for operating without a license in 2015 and it has not relaunched in Korea. Uber did manage to reintroduce its Black service in 2015, which was finally available to all users having previously been restricted to foreigners, government workers and citizens aged over 65.
All of this means that Uber has yet to really make an impact in Korea, leaving the road clear for Kakao and other rivals such as Callbus.


Ouch, Uber is pretty kneecapped in Seoul pic.twitter.com/fswTJJoEYT
— Jon Russell (@jonrussell) April 13, 2015



Away from ride-hailing, other services within the Kakao Mobility business include Kakao Driver, an app that summons a designated driver which claims 2.7 million monthly users, and mapping service Kakao Navi, which has clocked up 10 million registered users since its launch in February 2016.
Kakao Mobility plans to use its fresh capital to introduce a range of new services. That include a corporate service for Kakao Taxi, integrations with Kakao Pay, a test drive service, and additional overseas expansions. It said, too, that it aims to introduce new updates and options for its Kakao Driver and Kakao Navi services.
“As part of larger global trends, the traditional offline industry sector has been undergoing rapid transformation into developing online offerings, with the mobility business a particularly exciting and high-attention area,” said Joohwan Jung, who has been appointed CEO of Kakao Mobility, said in a statement.
“We see infinite opportunities ahead, and will strive to create new value for both users and businesses across the mobility business through strategic partnerships and by securing the top talent,” Jung added.

Uber riders have taken 5 billion trips using the service the company announced today, more than doubling the two billion milestone it hit back in 2016. The 5 billion mark was actually crossed in May. 156 trips began at 7:29:06 AM GMT on May 20, Uber says, putting the ride hailing service over the edge.
That’s a lot of trips for Uber, which is likely celebrating the traction under a cloud at the moment, given the fact that its CEO has just resigned, the results of an independent investigation into its culture found a lot of problem, and it’s dealing with a mounting pile of legal troubles. It’s hard to tell thus far how much that’s impacting Uber’s actual business, however; the company has been touting growth among ridership in 2017, though recent third-party stats including app downloads suggest rivals like Lyft are starting to gain on Uber’s market lead.
Uber’s 5 billionth trip isn’t just cause for the beleaguered company to enjoy some good news for once; the company is also rewarding all 156 of the drivers that provided the rides while it crossed the 5 billion mark with a $500 bonus. Riders – just look back at your history and find out if you were part of that, and your reward is the knowledge that you helped make up this engagement stat.

Ford’s recent executive shuffle was bound to lead to reorganization throughout the company, but the addition of a new Robotics and AI Research team operating under Ford’s Research and Advanced Engineering department seems like it was inevitable either way, given the industry’s trajectory.
Ford’s VP of Research and Engineering and CTO Dr. Ken Washington revealed the new research group via a Medium post, in which he discusses the huge potential impact of AI and robotics over the next decade. The team will work with Argo AI, the startup that Ford took a majority stake in earlier this year via a large investment, as well as on other partnership and acquisition/investment opportunities. It’ll help with work on drones, personal mobility platforms (last-mile, scooter-style transport), automation and “aerial robotics.”
Washington also discussed how in the future we’ll see “at least two” separate fleets of self-driving vehicles on the road operated by Ford: one led by Ford’s own team pursuing advanced research and another led by Argo AI focused on development and testing of the virtual driver system Ford intends to bring to production in time for its 2021 deployment of a ride-hailing fleet.
Focusing on AI and robotics research is not novel to Ford among automakers; Honda has long had a program in place to develop its robotics capability, and has frequently demonstrated its Asimo humanoid robot. Toyota also runs the Toyota Research Institute, an entire subsidiary devoted to long-term research and development of robotics and AI, through its own work and partnerships with leading academic institutions.

234,Uber ATG upgrades its autonomous truck test fleet with new tech,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/29/uber-atg-upgrades-its-autonomous-truck-test-fleet-with-new-tech/,2017/06/29,"
Uber’s Advanced Technologies Group has a new version of its testing transport truck for autonomous tech. The new model features an updated technology stack, including a 64-channel spinning LiDAR array, which is something never used previously on any of the former Otto’s test trucks.
The Uber ATG truck notably drops all Otto branding, as you can see, since Uber retired that name in May following a trademark dispute raised by Canada’s Otto Motors, and after the self-driving trucking company Uber acquired became the impetus for a suit by Alphabet’s Waymo contesting that Otto execs took confidential company info when they departed Google.
Uber’s Advanced Technology Group has taken over ownership of the project, with Otto falling under its umbrella as of last year, and now the trucks have been upgraded with some aspects of ATG tech for the first time. But ATG trucks product manager Alden Woodrow told me the former Otto team based in San Francisco is still leading the truck tech.
“Otto was based in San Francisco, and so with the integration, most of our engineering effort is still based in San Francisco for the trucks,” he said. “But one of the great things about being part of this larger team is we have that team in Pittsburgh that has a really world-class team and that has had several years’ head start on developing similar technologies. So we work really closely with the team in Pittsburgh.”

Woodrow also noted that in addition to close collaboration between the Pittsburgh and San Francisco teams, the new ATG office in Toronto under Raquel Urtasun will offer additional opportunities to help further develop their tech.
The new Uber ATG truck tech loadout also includes upgraded components and software throughout the vehicle in addition to the new spinning LiDAR, and is completely refreshed, with new hardware sensors and new software components throughout. This updates the design that was used previously, including during Otto’s press-grabbing autonomous Budweiser freight shipment haul, which subsequently earned a Guinness World Record for “the longest continuous journey by a driverless and autonomous semitrailer truck.”
Woodrow also says that this tech refresh also was not made as a direct result of the ongoing Uber/Waymo legal fight. The LiDAR used in the new design is an off-the-shelf part (most likely an HDL-64E sourced by Velodyne, given the design and specs, though he wasn’t able to confirm due to confidentiality agreements), rather than one developed in-house.
“It’s an off-the-shelf system from a third-party, so it’s actually separate from some of the things at issue in the Waymo suit about us developing our own LiDAR, it’s a totally separate product,” Woodrow said. “This is totally independent of that; it’s always been part of the plan to integrate the Otto technology with the ATG technology. The Otto stack actually didn’t use 64-channel LiDAR at all.”

Otto’s design never used LiDAR of this kind in its tech stack (a spinning, 64-channel module), Woodrow says, and the addition of its capabilities should help considerably with data available to the autonomous driving system.
“That really significantly improves what data the truck is able to capture about the world, so it builds a very high-quality point cloud of its surroundings,” he said. “So that really helps the software system make better decisions about what’s out there in the world and make better decisions.”
This new truck can be spotted in testing in SF and on neighboring highways, Woodrow says. I asked him how the California DMV feels about this, given some earlier reports that the licensing body was reportedly looking into its previous autonomous truck tests. Woodrow told me that they actually have a close relationship with the DMV, and that representatives were just in recently to get an update on their progress.
He also said he believes that their position is now that they consider the ATG trucks Level 2 vehicles, like Tesla vehicles equipped with Autopilot, meaning they don’t require autonomous licensing specifically. Every truck has a trained driver onboard ready to take control, Woodrow noted. I reached out to the DMV to confirm, but they didn’t immediately respond to my request for comment [Update: The DMV provided official comment, see below].
Uber ATG has also purchased a number of new trucks equipped with its new technology, and says it’s likely more San Franciscans will see the vehicles out and about on the roads as a result. He also said we can expect to see more demonstration runs like the Budweiser delivery in the future, though he added it’s a little too soon to talk about specifics just yet.
Update: The California DMV provided the following statement via spokesperson Artemio Armenta:

The DMV and CHP conducted an on-site visit on June 6 to assess the capability of the technology. The company has a “Level 2” driver assistance system that is in development and does not currently meet the definition of autonomous technology under California law.

Testing self-driving cars in California is like playing a video game on the “easy” setting, because it’s nice all the time and basically temperate year-round. Autonomous vehicles face significant challenges when it comes to more extreme weather conditions, which are a standard part of certifying any current cars for legal road-ready status.
Waymo, Alphabet’s self-driving car project, has already done testing in winter weather to help ensure its technology stack can operate in cold climates, and now it’s taking its new Chrysler Pacificas on the road for a test trip to the desert, where it’ll run into extreme heat at the other end of the spectrum.


Taking a desert road trip to thermal test our sensors – can confirm, it’s really hot. Next stops: Vegas & Death Valley pic.twitter.com/1eWc8FRU5U
— Waymo (@Waymo) June 28, 2017



Death Valley is one of the hottest places in the world – temperatures have reached highs that can melt tires, particularly in and around the July 4 weekend timeframe. Extreme temperatures tend to produce potentially unexpected behavior in electronics, so bringing your sensitively tuned sensing equipment to those kinds of conditions to see what happens is a necessary step in preparing them for broad consumer availability.
Waymo does all kinds of testing of its autonomous tech in various conditions, but with every generation of new sensor and compute equipment, it’s worth finding out if things still behave as intended.

Alphabet/Google’s self-driving car division Waymo disclosed earlier this month that it is working on (semi-)autonomous trucks, and now we have our first look at the vehicles in question.
Jalopnik published a number of photos of a Waymo branded truck kitted out with a radar, lidar and ultrasonic radars.

Waymo is, of course, not alone in exploring autonomous trucking.
The company took Uber to court over its employment of former Google self-driving car executive Antony Levandowski, who it alleged harbored company secrets that were used to start Otto, the self-driving truck startup that Uber acquired last year.
Levandowski, who has since been fired by Uber, founded Otto alongside a number of former Googlers in 2016.
Like Waymo, Otto’s focus is not to replace truck drivers altogether, but rather to automate much of their driving in the name of increased safety and efficiency. So that might mean that a truck drives itself on long stretches of highway, allowing the human driver to get to the final destination faster, focus on other things during the journey, and maybe even take a rest.

238,ChargePoint takes over GE charging stations,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/27/chargepoint-takes-over-ge-charging-stations/,2017/06/27,"
ChargePoint announced that it will become the exclusive operator of all of GE‘s electric charging stations, which means nearly 10,000 places to plug in will be transferred to the new company’s management. That total adds 1,800 commercial charging stations and 8,000 residential chargers to ChargePoint’s already huge network.
Not that existing users will notice much difference at first. ChargePoint said that it will maintain the existing software and commercial chargers to make the transition easier on those who’ve been using the system already. Users will get immediate access to ChargePoint‘s tools for finding charging stations when daring to drive outside your regular route and to track your usage.
Since ChargePoint builds the hardware and software and then sells it to station owners, it doesn’t actually own any of these charging stations — not even the new GE spots. But those GE owners will be able to use ChargePoint’s access controls for their existing stations, as well as having the ability to set their pricing charges. ChargePoint will also honor GE warranties on the chargers.
GE, a century-old company, manufactured WattStation and DuraStation chargers for residential and commercial use. They’ll all be added to the massive network operated by ChargePoint, a decade-old startup.

239,Volkswagen partners with Nvidia to expand its use of AI beyond autonomous vehicles,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/27/volkswagen-partners-with-nvidia-to-expand-its-use-of-ai-beyond-autonomous-vehicles/,2017/06/27,"
Volkswagen is working with Nvidia to expand its usage of its artificial intelligence and deep learning technologies beyond autonomous vehicles and into other areas of business, the two companies revealed today.
VW set up its Munich-based data lab in 2014. Last year it pushed on with the hiring of Prof. Patrick van der Smagt to lead a dedicated AI team that is tasked with taking the technology into areas such as ‘robotic enterprise,’ or use of the technology in enterprise settings.
That’s the backdrop to today’s partnership announcement. VW wants to use AI and deep learning to power new opportunities within its corporate business functions and, more widely, “in the field of mobility services.” As an example, the German car-maker said it is working on procedures to help optimize traffic flow in cities and urban areas, while it sees the potential for intelligent human-robot collaboration, too.
“Artificial intelligence is the key to the digital future of the Volkswagen Group. We want to develop and deploy high-performance AI systems ourselves. This is why we are expanding our expert knowledge required. Cooperation with NVIDIA will be a major step in this direction,” Dr. Martin Hofmann, CIO of the Volkswagen Group, said in a statement.
Beyond the work on VW’s own brands, the car-maker and Nvidia are teaming up to help other startups in the automotive space. The VW Data Lab is opening a startup support program that is specialized on machine learning and deep learning with Nvidia’s help. The first batch will include five startups and start this fall. The duo is also reaching out to students with a “Summer of Code” camp that will begin soon.
Nvidia is already working with VW-owned Audi on self-driving cars — which they are aiming to bring to market by 2020 — but today’s announcement is purely about the data potential and not vehicles themselves. VW did ink an agreement earlier this year to work with Nvidia to develop AI-cockpit services for its 12 automotive brands, but it is also working with rival chip firm Qualcomm on connected cars and smart in-car systems, too.
This VW hookup is one part of a triple dose of automotive-themed news updates from Nvidia today.
Separately, it announced that Volvo and Autoliv have committed to sell self-driving cars powered by its technology by 2021. Nvidia also signed up auto suppliers ZF and Hella to build additional safety standards into its autonomous vehicle platform.

"
240,Volvo and Autoliv aim to sell self-driving cars with Nvidia AI tech by 2021,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/26/volvo-and-autoliv-aim-to-sell-self-driving-cars-with-nvidia-ai-tech-by-2021/,2017/06/26,"
Volvo is forming a new joint partnership with Autoliv, called Zenuity, with a focus on developing self-driving automotive software. The plan is to eventually get to the point where they can field self-driving cars for sale, based on Nvidia’s Drive PX in-car AI computing platform, by the not-so-distant target year of 2021.
That’s a tall order, but Nvidia’s Drive PX is already being used to power self-driving vehicles in road testing today, including Nvidia’s own demonstration vehicles. Volvo and Autoliv’s Zenuity will use Nvidia’s AI car compute groundwork as the basis for their own software development, with the hopes of speeding up the development progress of Volvo’s commercially-targeted autonomous vehicles.
The software that we’re doing with them will be in some cases unique to Volvo,” explained Nvidia’s Senior Director of Automotive on call. “But Autoliv also has the rights to make the software available to other automakers. I think we’re starting to see, in the industry, these types of collaborations, and the opportunity to leverage from Nvidia a lot of this great work as well.”
Zenuity, as a new entity, will provide the resulting self-driving software from the partnership to Volvo directly, while Autoliv will also sell the same software to third-party OEMs using its existing supply channels and relationships. It’s great news for Nvidia, too, since that means their PX platform will be a key ingredient for OEMs looking to implement the system in their own vehicles.
Autoliv, a longtime safety technology supplier for the automotive industry, has been working on active safety systems including radar, vision and other ADAS tech for quite some time. But the company says that Nvidia’s AI platform will help it take its own autonomous and driver assistance tech to the next level.
Volvo and Nvidia had previously partnered for Volvo’s “Drive Me” autonomous car pilot program, but this is the first time the two have announced a partnership aimed at commercial sales of vehicles.

241,"Nvidia, ZF and Hella will team to ensure self-driving cars meet safety standards",https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/26/nvidia-zf-and-hella-will-team-to-ensure-self-driving-cars-meet-safety-standards/,2017/06/26,"
Auto industry suppliers ZF and Hella are welcoming a third strategic partner to their effort to bring self-driving systems to market for OEM clients. Nvidia is joining the two to help incorporate its own in-car AI technology in a self-driving system that meets the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) certification for passenger vehicles, and to also address safety requirements for commercial and off-road vehicles.
Hella builds camera systems, radar systems and other related software systems for ADAS-related tech, and ZF is one of the leading tier 1 suppliers in the car industry. Nvidia’s tech will be used to help bring systems to market that, starting with Level 3 autonomy (drivers can give over control but must be ready and able to resume manual driving at any moment) are properly certified according to the long-standing industry NCAP standards, which have governed consumer vehicles since their introduction in the 1970s.
“We’re now delivering across the whole spectrum of autonomous driving features,” explained Nvidia Senior Director of Automotive Danny Shapiro on a call. “What we’re doing is working with both ZF and Hella to bring NCAP safety certification to vehicles along with Level 3 type of [autonomous] driving systems, where in some cases you can do hands-free or feet-free driving.”
Shapiro said that ultimately, the crucial benefit to come out of this arrangement will be “a single platform from Nvidia can be connected to cameras to deliver NCAP certification and hands-free driving in certain circumstances.”
He added that Nvidia is “really excited that AI is having a transformative effect on the automotive industry in general,” including in NCAP-certified ADAS systems, since it means Nvidia’s AI computers will be in more cars, where they can then perform a range of functions over and above autonomous driving.
Nvidia’s tech could be use to potentially alert a driver to bring the car in for preventative or necessary maintenance, for instance. And there’s “no possible way for humans to sift through all this” he added, but a deep learning system based on Drive PX can be trained to sift massive amounts of data in real time.
“We’ll be playing a very active role in cybersecurity, we believe,” Shapiro said, adding that Nvidia can also “detect traffic patterns, detect congestion, optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion, work with infrastructure” once deployed at scale in more consumer vehicles.

242,Lyft adds pickup suggestions for smoother ride routing,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/26/lyft-adds-pickup-suggestions-for-smoother-ride-routing/,2017/06/26,"
Lyft will offer pickup suggestions in the latest version of the Android or iOS app, making it easier for drivers to pick riders up without having to do traffic gymnastics, while also hopefully saving riders time. The pickup suggestions only trigger when it’ll actually save you time as a rider, Lyft says, and they’re only ever within short walking distance, plus you can opt to stick with your original pickup spot should you so choose.
The pickup suggestions are available in every market where Lyft operates, and spell out explicitly how much time you’ll save by using them, accounting for walking time, and even factoring in stuff like time lost to crosswalks and traffic lights. Lyft rival Uber started testing suggested pickup points in 2015, and the app currently suggests those locations via green dots based on crowdsourced information about pickup history and other factors. Uber also allows users to decline pickup point suggestions.
Pickup suggestions should eliminate confusion and difficulties on both the rider and driver side of the Lyft equation, so it’s good to see this product update being rolled out by the ride hailing company. As mentioned, they’re rolling out across markets where Lyft operates, so expect to see them shortly provided your app’s up to date.

243,Avis signs on to manage Waymo’s self-driving vehicle fleet in Phoenix,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/26/avis-signs-on-to-manage-waymos-self-driving-vehicle-fleet-in-phoenix/,2017/06/26,"
Waymo has entered into an agreement with rental car company Avis that will see Avis manage its autonomous vehicle fleet in Phoenix. Phoenix is the site of Waymo’s first commercial self-driving car service, with the Alphabet-owned company launching an on-demand ride pilot in the Arizona city earlier this year.
The agreement, first reported by Bloomberg, will see Avis service and house Waymo’s fleet of self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans in Phoenix. Waymo still owns the cars, and it will pay Avis service fees in exchange for its role. The agreement is set for a multi-year span, but it isn’t exclusive, meaning Waymo could arrange similar deals with other rental service providers should it choose to do so.
Part of Avis’ appeal for Waymo, according to Bloomberg, is its ownership of Zipcar, the on-demand car sharing network that Avis acquired in 2013. Avis’ Zipcar experience shows the rental provider knows how to manage a distributed fleet of cars across an urban environment, with an app-based booking platform that incorporates location and billing.
On the Avis side, the deal means retrofitting existing owned real estate for housing the minivans, though not acquiring any more space. It’ll also handle regular maintenance of Waymo’s Pacificas, including cleaning and mechanical service. The service and housing arrangement isn’t yet active, and will go into effect later this year.
The autonomous vehicle industry shift continues to result in stakeholders playing musical chairs, and this is a prime example. Avis is smart to stake out an early claim, even in an non-exclusive arrangement that likely won’t drive significant revenue off the bat, just to help demonstrate where it might fit in once autonomy becomes a more widespread part of the transit industry.

244,Taking a ride in MIT’s self-driving wheelchair,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/24/taking-a-ride-in-mits-self-driving-wheelchair/,2017/06/24,"
Over the past few months, CSAIL’s (MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory) self-driving wheelchair has become a familiar sight around the MIT halls. It’s a nice little rolling advertisement for the lab’s work — and more importantly, it’s a great opportunity to test the mobility device in a real world setting. As students wander by in groups, deep in conversation or face down in their smartphones, their paths are unpredictable and collisions are a very real possibility. 
This kind of real world testing is exactly why the chair exists in the first place. It’s hard to test autonomous cars in out on the streets. It turns out there’s a lot of red tape involved when it comes to trying out driverless technology in the real world — particularly in a densely populated city like Boston. 
Nearby military bases have popped up on the list of possible locations, but in the meantime, the school needed ways to try out their ideas before scaling them up to two ton pieces of rolling metal. The wheelchair serves as a good middle ground between real and remote control cars, letting researchers iterate more quickly on their ideas. The fact that the product could have real world applications for people with mobility issues is something of a happy coincidence.



“The current research that’s being done is using it more as a platform, but there are people who are discussing doing research specifically on the chair,” says Thomas Balch, an MIT robotics software engineer. “A lot of the research I’ve seen people doing since I’ve been [at CSAIL] has been focused on helping people with disabilities deal with things more easily.”
The chair feature the same LIDAR scanners the school is using on their full-sized cars, along with a mapping technology CSAIL developed way back in 2010 for use on the streets of Singapore, long before autonomy became the buzz word it is today. That system, mounted on top of the wheelchair, creates a 3D map of the fixed points around it — in this case, the irregularly-spaced walls of the Frank Geary-designed Stata Center. A smaller scanner up front, meanwhile, detects obstacles in its way.
Balch and MIT research assistant Felix Naser offer me a quick ride around the Stata lobby on the wheelchair — not exactly the campus tour I was expecting. First, they map the path, using a joystick and the 3D mapping tech up top. It’s nothing too exciting — just a straight shot from one side of the building to the other. Once traced, the path is visible as a color line on a large tablet mounted on one of the arm rests. The walls are a solid black, and feet show up as small multi-colored dots. The birds-eye view of the room isn’t exactly complex, but it does the trick.

The ride is slow and smooth — as you’d hope from an electric wheelchair. When the system detects a person, it slowly comes to a full stop, readjusts its position and drives around the person in its way. The process took around 10 to 15 seconds. If anything, the system is probably overly cautious at this point, stopping any time someone passes in its periphery. An abundance of caution is a fine quality in a wheelchair, but in this case, probably not something you want in a car. 
For added protection, Balch follows close behind with an Xbox controller in-hand, serving as an emergency brake. It’s a reminder of how much work needs to be done, even at this slow speed, before researchers are comfortable letting these vehicles cruise without any kind of human pilot providing backup. But low-speed, low-impact settings like this are a much safer place to work out some of those bugs.
Once perfected, however, the system could one day be deployed in busy hospitals to help transport patients across the floor. The school has been in talks with hospitals around the world about potential pilot programs, but as of yet, this branch of CSAIL’s self-driving car research has yet to yield real world commercial application.

246,Nissan’s ProPILOT driver assist features coming to the new LEAF EV,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/23/nissans-propilot-driver-assist-features-coming-to-the-new-leaf-ev/,2017/06/23,"

Nissan will be bringing its ProPILOT Assist ADAS features to the brand new Nissan LEAF, the redesigned version of its pioneering EV, which is still “coming soon” and mostly still a secret. We do, however, expect it to have around 200 miles of range on some models, which is more than double the current version.
The ProPILOT features will provide semi-autonomous acceleration, braking and steering features while driving in single-lane settings on highways. It’s a feature that debuted first on Nissan vehicles in Japan, and the LEAF marks the first time it’ll make its way beyond the company’s home country.
Nissan’s ProPILOT tech is its effort to build out to full autonomy eventually, with the end goal being a system that can navigate even busy city intersections as well as stretches of relatively uncomplicated open road. In this stage, it’s like a more limited version of Tesla’s Autopilot, but it’s still a step towards greater autonomy on consumer shipping vehicles.

247,Honda Clarity grows from one-shot to series,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/22/honda-clarity-grows-from-one-shot-to-series/,2017/06/22,"
For years, the Honda Clarity has been one thing: a hydrogen fuel-cell-powered sedan available for lease to a vetted group of early adopters in California. Now in its third generation, the Honda Clarity fuel-cell car is still basically that. But it’s getting a couple of friends.
This year, the Honda Clarity adds two new versions: an all-electric car and a plug-in hybrid. Granted, the fuel cell Clarity is technically an electric car, but the electric version charges at any outlet rather than being fueled at a so-far rare hydrogen fueling station.
The three were shown together for the first time in the United States since their unveiling at the New York Auto Show at the Drive Revolution event in Portland, Oregon. Journalists had the chance to drive them back to back to evaluate their similarities and differences over short urban routes — and to compare them to their energy-efficient competitors. There are, of course, similarities in the design; these are all Clarity models. There are subtle differences in the grilles, and they have badging specific to their drivetrain type, but otherwise they are identical large four-door sedans.
This one-car-many-powertrains strategy is one other manufacturers are using, as well, especially when it comes to advanced drivetrain technologies. Hyundai, for example, has the Ioniq series, with hybrid, PHEV and EV versions. As Natalie Kumaratne, a Clarity specialist for Honda, pointed out, this makes it easier for manufacturers to respond to changes in consumers’ buying habits.
Right now, PHEVs are gaining in popularity, and the Clarity PHEV will be available in all 50 states. The Clarity fuel cell is only available in California because that’s where the infrastructure exists to make these cars practical. The Clarity EV is somewhere in the middle of that mix. When hydrogen stations become more widespread, or when EV demand reaches a tipping point, the mix can change at the factory in Japan more easily than if these were separate models.
Driving dynamics for the three cars are very similar, but ranges are wildly different. The EV has a range of about 90 miles per charge; the PHEV drives 42 miles on electric power alone and 330 miles with the gasoline engine; and the fuel cell can travel 366 miles, the highest range of any zero-emissions vehicle in the country.
Kumaratne noted that Honda is all in on fuel cell technology. The company sees it as a major part of its electrification process, and it has set a goal of selling 75,000 total Clarity vehicles in the United States in the next four years. That’s part of its larger goal of having 60 percent or more of its sales worldwide be electric vehicles by 2030.

248,Tesla said to be in talks to create its own streaming music service,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/22/tesla-said-to-be-in-talks-to-create-its-own-streaming-music-service/,2017/06/22,"
Tesla might be a music service operator soon, in addition to a maker of electric cars and solar energy products. That’s according to a new report from Recode, which says that Tesla has been talking to music labels to make this happen.
The planned offering could start with a free, Pandora-like streaming radio option, which theoretically would be tied to Tesla vehicle ownership, one imagines. This sounds like a bizarre road for Tesla to take, but founder and CEO Elon Musk hinted that the company was exploring music products at the most recent Tesla shareholder meeting in early June.
Musk’s comments including noting that at present, it’s “very hard to find good playlists or good matching algorithms” for music you want to hear while driving, and that Tesla would make an announcement about how it could address that later this year.
Musk’s sly comments sounded like the teasing of someone who has a juicy secret and can’t help but reveal just a bit of what they know, so it’s likely this is another project inspired by personal experience, much like The Boring Company, which was borne from Musk’s exasperation with LA traffic.
As to why Tesla feels the need to go it alone here, instead of just working closely with another partner, that remains to be seen – it’s also possible this could still end up taking the form of a partnership, depending on how label talks proceed.
And even though it seems weird, if Tesla is thinking ahead to a future in which cars operate autonomously for much of the time, services will be a key business for Tesla to have a hand in, especially those that make the most sense for use in-car during trips.

249,Waymo filing says ex-Uber CEO Travis Kalanick knew engineer had Google info,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/22/waymo-filing-says-ex-uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-knew-engineer-had-google-info/,2017/06/22,"
In the ongoing legal case between Uber and Waymo, a new filing suggests Uber knew that Anthony Levandowski possessed Google information as of last March, before Otto’s acquisition. The former Google self-driving project engineer founded Otto, and then joined Uber to lead its self-driving efforts when Otto was acquired by the ride-hailing giant.
Waymo’s new filing cites a response from Uber itself, made June 8 in response to a discovery request from Waymo, which contains the following admission:
“On or about March 11, 2016, Mr. Levandowski reported to Mr. Kalanick, Nina Qi and Cameron Poetzscher at Uber as well as Lior Ron that he had identified five discs in his possession containing Google information…”
This would obviously be a strong piece of support for Waymo’s case, as it establishes a timeline in which Uber was aware of Levandowski’s alleged actions even prior to finalizing their acquisition of Otto, which would in turn mean that Uber can’t claim to be completely separated from Levandowski’s actions. Uber has attempted to distance itself from Levandowski in these matters, and in fact dismissed the former Google engineer recently for failing to comply with its own internal investigation.
Waymo also succeeded in a discovery matter to get Stroz Friedberg, the security firm that produced the due diligence report prior to Uber’s acquisition, to produce a laundry list of related documents it collected in pursuit of its due diligence investigation. These are required by the court by June 27, and include any reports created by the firm following its retention by Uber and Otto, as well as communications between Levandowski, the firm, Otto co-founder Lior Ron and their attorneys.
The full filings can be seen below. Waymo declined to comment, and Uber could not immediately be reached for comment.

Navya will deploy two of its driverless multi-passenger shuttles this fall at the University of Michigan, moving students autonomously between Michigan’s North Campus Research Complex and its Lurie Engineering Center across a two-mile route. The 15-passenger vehicles are being deployed in conjunction with Mcity, the University of Michigan-led partnership with autonomous private industry players that’s designed to bring driverless tech to market safely and quickly.
The Navya’s Arma shuttles used in this deployment are equipped with GPS, cameras, Wi-Fi and LiDAR, and they’ll be tested not only on how they operate, but also on how passengers react to them and use them, as well as how others sharing the roads, including pedestrians and cyclists, react to their presence. They’ll operate during regular business hours at the outset, and be available for free, with plans to expand how long they run each day should everything go well.

Navya also announced that it’s going to be manufacturing its vehicles at a location in Southeast Michigan earlier this week, with an assembly facility that’s set to begin operations by the end of this year.

251,"Uber’s toxic culture risks its driverless future, too",https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/21/ubers-toxic-culture-risks-its-driverless-future-too/,2017/06/21,"
So Uber’s blowhard-in-chief Travis Kalanick is finally out, out as CEO — after some of its most prominent investors put the squeeze on him to go (not just take a time out).
Scandal after scandal has hammered the company in recent times, culminating in an external investigation into a corporate culture accused by a former female employee of being rife with sexism, aggression and inequality.
Kalanick’s aggressive style of management has been the Uber rule, not the exception — and arguably, setting aside the current slew of internal scandals, the company has been taking a more emollient approach, at least vis-a-vis business expansion. Working to change rules, for sure, but not always so publicly riding roughshod over them as it used to.
Although in private the underhand tactics have evidently continued.
Which does beg the question, why now? Why is Kalanick finally being pushed from Uber’s driving seat?
The short answer is because a toxic corporate culture has the power to kill a company stone dead by turning its customer base against it.
#deleteuber has been a very potent hashtag indeed.
Contrast that with the thrusting Uber upstart that was, revving its engines against regulators and able to enlist its own user-base as a lobbying army to help get its rubber on the road — messaging and mobilizing users to apply pressure to city authorities Uber slammed as bureaucratic and anti-innovation.
Petitions to ‘save Uber’ have, previously, garnered hundreds of thousands of signatures. The company even Uber-ed in its own users to pad out pro-Uber demonstrations in years past.
How times change. And how far the mighty can fall when they squander goodwill.
Brand car crash
Investors, first and foremost, are concerned with the value of a company — because that will ultimately determine the value of their investment. So make no mistake, Uber’s investors have calculated the company’s toxic culture under Kalanick’s leadership is a risk to their long term investment.
Yes, it’s not just Kalanick who’s gone. There are a raft of changes being driven through the upper echelons of Uber. Prior to Kalanick’s resignation his controversial righthand man, Emil Michael, also departed — one of the recommendations from the external investigation.
More than 20 other Uber employees were also fired earlier this month, following the report. Others are still under investigation.
Meanwhile, Uber poached a female marketing lead from Apple for a new senior role: chief of branding. Repairing the company’s ‘fratboy’ image is clearly front of mind for board member Arianna Huffington, who was reportedly responsible for hiring in Bozoma Saint John.
“Boz has a long track record of successfully creating emotional connections between people and the products they love,” said Kalanick in a statement about the hire earlier this month. “Her creativity and deep understanding of consumers will allow us to build the same love and appreciation for Uber’s brand as we’ve built for Uber’s service.”
Having the (now ex) Uber CEO talking about “emotional connections” and “love” is about as far from Travis Kalanick 1.0 as it’s possible to get. Yet here we are.
Also recently coming in at senior level: another woman, Frances Frei, an academic from Harvard Business School, who takes up another new role: SVP of leadership and strategy.
The message from Uber’s investors is clear: aggressive tech bros out; responsibility, accountability, empathy and diversity in.
In Travis’ own words, Uber needs to “grow up”.
Whether this last ditch reboot comes in time to save Uber’s tattered and tarnished brand remains to be seen. But Uber’s investors clearly want the company to project a very different set of values — and view a radical shift in how outsiders perceive Uber as key to its future.
Sexism, bullying, inequality, lack of diversity, low empathy all are being judged as negative factors for ROI.
Looking beyond the immediate damage of a campaign like #deleteuber, there’s something else to consider for the long term: A big part of Uber’s perceived value has been attached to the notion that autonomous vehicle technology will enable the company to slough off its (human) driver cost-base entirely, i.e. not just by (as it does now) minimizing employment costs by using — some would say exploiting — low paid, ‘freelance contractors’ who do the actual work of driving people from A to B.
As far back as 2014 Kalanick has been saying Uber’s future lies in driverless cars.
“When there’s no other dude in the car, the cost of taking an Uber anywhere becomes cheaper than owning a vehicle. So the magic there is, you basically bring the cost below the cost of ownership for everybody, and then car ownership goes away,” he said three years ago, when Uber was valued at around $17BN, and without apparently a thought for the thousands of “dudes” he planned on leaving in the dust down the road.
Uber’s most recent valuation is ~$70BN — although it’s not clear what portion of value investors are attaching to its autonomous long term vision. (Also worth noting: some question whether Uber is worth half so much.)
Questions about the profitability of ride-hailing models are certainly being asked much more frequently these days. And while Uber’s business has been growing, with the company pulling in $3.4BN in revenue in the first quarter and narrowing its losses to $708M, it is still burning a LOT of cash. Uber’s route to profitability must at least be on the mind of its very long list of investors — who have packed its coffers with some $8.81BN over the years.
These investors sure don’t want to see their money getting sucked into a toxic sinkhole.
One reason for the company’s backers to be asking more questions about its future profitability now is because labor costs are unlikely to do anything but rise in the short term — i.e. before it’s able to replace all drivers with robots.
Not least because lawmakers and regulators are paying closer attention to the gig economy — eyeing what are being seen as employment law loopholes.
And also because a proliferation of ride-hailing rivals are available at the switch of an app to lure away disgruntled Uber drivers.
Hence Uber finally adding tipping to try to keep its drivers happy — and, if we’re honest, to provide a way to raise their financial remuneration (i.e. via customer largess) without having to increase how much it pays them.
While Uber trying to flip a future profit by raising the price of rides would of course risk an exodus of users accustomed to cheap Uber trips.
But — if you’d bought into the big autonomous vision, as Kalanick painted it — those sorts of near term problems (and costs) standing in the way of Uber’s profitability looked set to evaporate over the long term, once the app could deliver shiny, driverless cars on demand, 24/7.
Or if, rather, Uber’s management could deliver on the autonomous promise.
Autonomy and empathy
The problems Uber has run into in developing self-driving technology are thus of huge significance for its investors. And there are problems aplenty.
At the end of last month Uber fired the person Kalanick brought in to lead its autonomous efforts, Otto co-founder Anthony Levandowski, who is now embroiled in a trade secrets lawsuit between Uber and Waymo, the Google-owned company where Levandowski used to work.
It’s not clear how the case will shake out, with the judge denying Uber’s request for a stay pending its appeal for arbitration earlier this month. In the meanwhile Uber’s efforts to develop self-driving tech are facing an obvious set back. That has to have been a big black mark against Kalanick’s judgement as far as Uber investors are concerned.
But I’d argue it’s not just technology that counts here. Culture is also crucial because autonomy demands empathy. Lots of empathy — in order to win human populations into accepting the robots being placed among them.
Even in a 100% driverless scenario Uber’s autonomous cars will still have to interact with humans. Firstly as passengers — and humans who don’t appreciate a product or a service won’t necessarily treat it very well. Witness the state of public toilets which don’t have attendants, for example.
But also, and arguably more importantly, with non-Uber users — because Uber’s robot cars will be operating in the public environment, sharing the streets with human pedestrians, human cyclists, humans driving standard vehicles and so on.
Now Uber may have built its rep as a company with a thirst to rip up the rulebook — earning itself accusations of putting business growth before safety (witness, for example, its effort to defeat a city bill requiring fingerprint-based background checks for drivers; when it lost that battle it pulled its business out of Austin — returning only after Texas legislators reined in the power of municipalities to regulate ride-hailing companies… aka: classic Uber 1.0 behavior).
But there’s no self-driving company on earth that will be able to program its robots to do anything other than slam on the brakes when a flesh-and-blood human walks out into the road.
Slaying non-users is not a viable business model unless your business is making military drones. So self-driving cars will necessarily have to give way to pedestrians. And will require the goodwill of other drivers giving way to them.
These robots will therefore be highly susceptible to human emotions. And will rely on supportive sentiment in wider society. Which means Uber really has to care about how non-users view it. It will need a positive brand that can shield it from the risk of vandalism and spite.
History has lessons for what can happen to expensive technology that lacks wider public support. And if people generally associate Uber’s brand with toxic inequality they’re not going to feel inclined to offer respect and courtesy to Uber’s robots. Why should they?
Indeed, some humans may feel justified in deliberately messing with Uber’s machines as a form of protest. It’s very easy to imagine a ‘reclaim the streets from robots’ type of movement gaining momentum.
Roads are after all shared spaces. Even Tesla’s Elon Musk is not proposing to replicate the entire road network with bespoke tunnels that can carry a single type of vehicle. Nor will every autonomous car be able to be a flying car than can rise above the fray.
Respect for — or at very least tolerance of — other road users will be vital for traffic to flow for the foreseeable future, and — I would also argue — for Uber’s autonomous business to grow.
As we’ve written before, the limitations of a technology are at least as important as its capabilities. So it looks clear that self-driving cars will only function with the goodwill of humans.
And it goes without saying that angry humans forced to rub up against a toxic brand won’t have much goodwill to give.
So Uber’s path to a profitable, autonomous future arguably relies, not just on it being able to build or acquire the necessary technology, but on building a company whose culture and brand reflects and represents the sorts of qualities — courtesy, respect, fairness, humility, compromise, co-operation, concern — that have been so drastically lacking at its leadership level to date.
Nothing short of a 180 degree handbrake turn in company culture will do.
It looks like Uber’s investors have finally realized that too.

252,Volvo’s Polestar is now its own company focused on performance EVs,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/21/volvos-polestar-is-now-its-own-company-focused-on-performance-evs/,2017/06/21,"
Volvo tuner Polestar, which the carmaker acquired in 2015 to build its own race-ready Volve cars, is now being set up as its own separate company within the Volvo group, with a new focus on performance electric vehicles. The new Polestar will have its own branding, distinct from Volvo’s – though it’ll still produce performance versions of Volvo cars in addition to its own models, Slashgear reports.
The new Polestar will build its own EVs, as mentioned, but the focus will still be on making these attractive to those in the market for high-performance vehicles. This could put the new Volvo subsidiary in direct competition with Tesla and its Model S, currently the easy first choice for those looking for a vehicle that has both an all-electric drivetrain and the ability to deliver track-topping speed, acceleration and handling.
We’ll find out more about what exactly Polestar has planned for its own vehicles this fall, the company says, which could coincide with a bunch of announcements from Tesla, too, since that’s roughly when it says it’ll reveal its electric semi-truck plans. Musk has been dropping hints that an updated Roadster reveal is in the works, too, and noted that we should expect some surprises at the September truck event, so maybe fall will be a very interesting season for performance EV fans.

253,Mayor of London’s plan for city transport aims for zero emissions by 2050,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/21/mayor-of-londons-plan-for-city-transport-aims-for-zero-emissions-by-2050/,2017/06/21,"
London could be a lot more green by 2050 – Mayor Sadiq Khan has outlined a plan for transportation service (via Engadget) in the city that would make the whole system, including taxis, cars and buses, totally emission free by that year. Even though that’s over 30 years away, it’s still an incredibly ambitious plan that will require a lot of pieces to fall into place.
Those pieces are also taken into consideration, as Khan’s “Transport Strategy” draft describes how this would include stages like making all taxis and for-hire private vehicles zero-emission “capable” as of 2033, then buses and all other road vehicles meeting that same standard by 2033 and 2040 respectively.
Also included in the plan are staged introduction of emission-free city zones, which start small in 2025 and grow eventually to cover the whole city. And the plan isn’t just about encouraging emissions-free cars; Khan suggests walking, cycling and public transit should grow from making up 64 percent of in-city transport today, to 80 percent by 2041. That alone would help with the metrics.
This isn’t a plan that’s set in stone or binding at this stage by any means, but it’s an interesting sign of where regulators and top city officials are thinking in terms of ensuring cities remain livable as they swell and grow even more densely populated.

254,Tesla hires deep learning expert Andrej Karpathy to lead Autopilot vision,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/20/tesla-hires-deep-learning-expert-andrej-karpathy-to-lead-autopilot-vision/,2017/06/20,"
Tesla has hired deep learning and computer vision expert Andrej Karpathy in a key Autopilot role. Karpathy most recently held a role as a researcher at OpenAI, the artificial intelligence nonprofit backed by Elon Musk. He has an extensive background in AI-related fields, having completed a PhD at Stanford University in computer vision.
Karpathy also created one of the original, and most respected, deep learning courses taught at Stanford, and his dissertation work focused on creating a system by which a neural network could identify multiple discrete and specific items within an image, label them using natural language and report to a user. The dissertation also included developing a system that works in reverse, allowing for a model that can use descriptions from a user articulated in natural language (i.e. “white tennis shoes”) and find that object in a given image.
Karpathy also previously interned at Google’s DeepMind, focusing on deep learning, and attended both the University of British Columbia and the University of Toronto before that. His work and expertise should prove a big asset to Tesla’s work on Autopilot, especially in the area of Tesla Vision, the compute vision system built by the company to support Autopilot and its future self-driving initiative.
In his new role as Director of AI and Autopilot Vision, Karpathy will report to Musk directly, but he will also work closely in concert with Tesla’s Jim Keller, who previously led Tesla’s Autopilot hardware division but who now oversees both hardware and software for the automaker’s vehicle automated driver assistance features.
Tesla provided the following statement to TechCrunch regarding Karpathy’s hiring and responsibilities:

Andrej Karpathy, one of the world’s leading experts in computer vision and deep learning, is joining Tesla as Director of AI and Autopilot Vision, reporting directly to Elon Musk. Andrej has worked to give computers vision through his work on ImageNet, as well as imagination through the development of generative models, and the ability to navigate the internet with reinforcement learning. He was most recently a Research Scientist at OpenAI.
Andrej completed his computer vision PhD at Stanford University, where he demonstrated the ability to derive complex descriptions of images using a deep neural net. For example, identifying not simply that there is a cat in a given picture, but that it is an orange, spotted cat, riding on a skateboard with red wheels on brown hardwood flooring (http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/main.pdf). He also created and taught “Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition,” the first and still leading deep learning course at Stanford.
Andrej will work closely with Jim Keller, who now has overall responsibility for Autopilot hardware and software.

255,Tesla reportedly nears agreement to build a vehicle factory in China,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/20/tesla-reportedly-nears-agreement-to-build-a-vehicle-factory-in-china/,2017/06/20,"
Tesla’s next Gigafactory could be in China, according to a report from Bloomberg. The electric car maker is in talks to build its vehicles in the country for the first time, and it’s nearing an agreement with the city of Shanghai to construct the manufacturing facility in a nearby industrial development zone.
The final details of the agreement are still in flux, and Bloomberg says timing about when it’ll be made official could still change. Tesla will also need to partner up with a local automaker to create a joint venture in the company, as other automakers entering local production from overseas have done, in keeping with local requirements.
A local presence could be a huge boon for Tesla, which is seeing big growth in its business in the country. Currently, Model S and Model X vehicles bought in the country face a 25 percent import tax, and as Tesla expands its business to more affordable market segments, sidestepping that tax with local assembly facilities will be key.
China also has aggressive targets and incentives for vehicle electrification, which could help Tesla with its larger global goals. Back in March, Tesla also received investment from Tencent, which acquired a five percent stake in the energy co. for $1.8 billion – that could help it pave the way for  heightened local footprint, too.
Elon Musk has said that Tesla is looking at new global locations for Gigafactories, and could announce as many as four new spots for the gigantic manufacturing facilities within the next year.

256,Maven brings its Gig on-demand car service for freelancers to San Francisco,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/20/maven-brings-its-gig-on-demand-car-service-for-freelancers-to-san-francisco/,2017/06/20,"
GM’s Maven car-sharing service debuted Gig in May, a new offering on the platform designed specifically for gig economy workers. The idea is that people can rent cars for as little as a week at a time, with an all-in cost that covers insurance, maintenance and free charging for EVs. Now, Gig is kicking off in San Francisco, after its initial rollout in San Diego.
The SF launch includes a fleet made up of Chevrolet Bolt all-electric cars, as well as the Chevy Cruze, Malibu or Trax. Rates includes $229 per week for the Bolt, $189 per week for the Cruze, $199 per week for the Malibu and $209 per week for the Trax. These prices don’t include taxes, however, or fuel – though the Bolt does come with free charging at EVGo stations “for a limited time,” according to Maven.
The Maven Gig model is based on the idea that the freelance economy often means people need vehicles sometimes, but not consistently, and will set aside weeks or months where they’re more active doing things like ride hailing and on-demand delivery, in order to make some extra cash for specific goals. While Maven also partners with specific gig economy companies including Uber, Gig is designed to provide an open platform that can work with any services, though its official partners for Gig include GrubHub, Instacart, and Roadie to name a few.
Gig has seen 20,000 miles driven since launch in San Diego in May, Maven says, with a fleet of Bolt EVs exclusively. The expanded pool of available vehicles in San Francisco likely means Maven decided to tweak the model and offer more variety in the fleet based on user feedback from the San Diego pilot.
Theoretically, San Francisco should be the ideal fit for Gig, since it’s basically the home of the on-demand economy. Maven says Gig is coming to LA next, with a release sometime later this year.

257,Lyft rolls out new tipping prompts as drivers pass $250 million in tips earned,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/19/lyft-rolls-out-new-tipping-prompts-as-drivers-pass-250-million-in-tips-earned/,2017/06/19,"
Lyft is touting a metric that its main rival can’t crow about – tip money earned through the platform. Lyft famously offers an in-app tipping option for riders, while Uber does not; and since Lyft announced that drivers had collectively earned over $100 million in tips four years after the company started its ride-hailing business, it’s been providing updates on the earning potential represented by tips on a semi-regular basis. Today, it has a new update on total earnings, and it’s rolling out new features that could contribute even more to tip-based earning potential.
Just two-and-a-half months ago, Lyft announced that total tips had passed the $200 million milestone, so the additional $50 million accumulated between now and then has come at a faster rate than ever before. A few factors might be helping out here: First, Lyft has greatly improved its footprint in the U.S. in the beginning of 2017, expanding to well over 100 new cities. Second, Lyft is gaining ground on Uber in terms of market share as Uber reels from its cultural and leadership problems, at a rate that we haven’t seen before between the two rivals.
Lyft is now going to start showing new pre-set tip options in rides to hopefully help drivers earn more on longer rides, the company revealed today. On trips where the fare is above $25, riders will now get $2, $5 and $10 tipping options instead of $1, $2 and $5 choices (custom tip options also remain for all rides). Lyft says than in its initial small group testing, it’s already seeing tips rise on those rides where the cost is over $25 and people are seeing the new selections.
Just having tips at all is a competitive advantage on the supply side for Lyft, but the fact that it’s iterating on this to try to bump up earning potential means it’s aware and hopes to press that advantage. Uber has taken steps to try to shore up its driver-side product and address concerns of that client base, but Lyft’s focus on the upside here might help it earn more goodwill.

Tier one auto industry supplier Bosch is investing heavily in where the market is headed, with a newly-announced $1.1 billion facility that will produce semiconductors uses in self-driving cars, smart homes and smart city infrastructure. The new Dresden-based chip fab is set to start producing silicon commercially in 2021, and construction should wrap up in 2019.
The greatly expanded chip manufacturing capacity that this will afford Bosch is seen by the company as a key ingredient in helping them stay in their key supply position as automakers continue to shift focus to connected services and mobility platforms. Bosch is no novice when it comes to chipmaking, however; the company has supplied chips for cars, as well as more recent devices like smartphones, for over 40 years according to Bloomberg.
The new plant will also supply chips that provide more traditional functionality to cars, including those that trigger airbag deployment and control instrument panel readings, as well as in-car cellular connectivity.
Intel is also attempting to position itself as a key chip supplier in the world of autonomous vehicles, as is Qualcomm (aided by its purchase of NXP, though that’s currently being investigated by the EU prior to finalization). Bosch has been operating in this field for a long time, but the autonomous market is different, so it’ll be very interesting to see whether those coming from the computing side or those on the automotive end of the spectrum end up claiming a more dominant position in the market.

259,GM’s Cruise driverless car unit gets into high-definition mapping,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/19/gms-cruise-driverless-car-unit-gets-into-high-definition-mapping/,2017/06/19,"
The tech used in making cars drivereless can also be very well suited to building HD maps of roads and cities, which are then in turn used to make driverless cars better. So it isn’t surprising when companies working on autonomous tech also focus on building their own high-definition maps, which go beyond regular maps by fusing LiDAR, radar and visual information for a very accurate milimeter-level detail.
That’s why it makes perfect sense to see GM’s Cruise Automation do more in HD mapping, as the WSJ reports, with a new role being recruited to head up a dedicated HD mapping team within the company, which the automaker acquired last year. GM’s mapping efforts via Cruise will eventually cover over 100 cities, the job offer says, and could help to give the company an edge over would-be rivals in the autonomous car tech field, including Alphabet’s Waymo.
There are a range of companies working on HD mapping for self-driving cars, including Ford-backed Civil Maps and HERE, the mapping service co-owned by Daimler, BMW and Audi following its acquisition from Nokia. Likewise, Mobileye is working on real-time mapping solutions for autonomous in tandem with HERE. Many automakers seem content to leave HD mapping to partners in the supply chain, rather than something they do in-house, but it becomes a more important piece of the puzzle to own if you want to create a solution you can offer turn-key to other would-be driverless vehicle operators.
The effort to enter mapping may be relatively new to GM, but the company has some advantages, including a large number of active vehicles on the road equipped with the advanced sensors needed for HD mapping, thanks to advanced driver assistance (ADAS) features on GM cars. GM is also rapidly growing its fleet of Cruise test Chevy Bolt EV cars, which could help with the efforts in those cities where they operate.

260,Lyft sets goal of 1 billion autonomous electric rides per year by 2025,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/15/lyft-sets-goal-of-1-billion-autonomous-electric-rides-per-year-by-2025/,2017/06/15,"
Lyft has set itself some concrete goals for its renewed commitment to the Paris climate agreement, in spite of Trump’s announcement that the U.S. as a nation would be pulling out of the accord. Those goals focus primarily on Lyft’s autonomous ambitions, and so are contingent on the ride hailing company accomplishing its self-driving vision at scale, but they’re laudable goals nonetheless.
The targets Lyft has set include powering 100 percent of the autonomous electric vehicles using its platform in the future from 100 percent renewable energy – starting from day one, which means beginning with the couple of cars Lyft is fielding in partnership with Nutonomy on Boston streets starting a little later on this year. Lyft announced that it would be running some Renault Zoe electric cars outfitted with Nutonomy’s autonomous vehicle tech earlier this month.
Lyft is also seeking to provide at minimum 1 billion rides per year via electric autonomous vehicles by 2025. That’s a tall order, given that Lyft provided 160 million rides in 2016, the company revealed at the beginning of this year. A minimum of 1 billion rides in 2025, solely from autonomous electric vehicles, envisions dramatic, sustained, year-over-year growth between now and then.
Finally, Lyft says it will reduce CO2 emissions across the U.S. transportation sector by at minimum 5 million tons annually by 2025, which sounds like a reasonable result provided it manages to achieve the above ride numbers.
These are all goals that seem to rely heavily on Lyft making good on its plans to combine autonomous and electrification trends with a wide range of automaker and self-driving company partnerships to maximize its reach. It’ll also require driverless tech to continue to develop, to accelerate its advent and to be received smoothly by regulators, all of which seem like optimistic goals.

261,Uber rival Careem closes $500M raise at $1B+ valuation as Daimler steps in,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/14/uber-rival-careem-closes-500m-raise-at-1b-valuation-as-daimler-steps-in/,2017/06/14,"
Amid ongoing struggles at Uber, one of its stronger regional rivals in transportation on demand has raised a significant round of funding, picking up a significant strategic investor in the process. Careem, a transportation startup currently in 80 cities across the Middle East, has raised another $150 million — closing out a $500 million Series E round that it confirmed in December when it announced the first $350 million tranche. With the new funds, Mudassir Sheikha, Careem’s co-founder and CEO, confirmed that Careem’s valuation is now over $1 billion. A separate source tells us more precisely that the funding is now $1.2 billion.
This latest tranche is being led by Saudi-based Kingdom Holding, the VC that also backs Lyft and invested in Twitter and Snap before they went public. German automaker Daimler (which itself has acquired Hailo in the UK, Taxibeat in Greece and MyTaxi in Germany), and VCs Lumia Capital, DCM Ventures and Coatue Management also participated. (A source confirms to us that the overall $500 million is being led by Rakuten, which invested in the first tranche.)
“With our investment in Careem, we are now taking the strategic step to becoming the world’s leading provider of mobility services,” Klaus Entenmann, CEO, Daimler Financial Services AG, said in a statement. “Careem has quickly leapt to the leadership of ridesharing within the MENA regions by delivering rapid innovation and customer growth, and it is spearheading new ways to transport people from point A to point B.”
This is a significant Series E for Careem — previously, the company had only raised $72 million. The size of the round speaks of the opportunity that investors see right now to grow more regional transportation services — both in direct competition with Uber and incumbent forms of transportation, as well as to tap a very big opportunity.
In the case of Careem, the latter is actually the stronger force at the moment. Sheikha — who co-founded the company with Magnus Olsson (who is the MD) — estimates that Careem plus Uber account for only around 1 percent of the potential market for transportation services in the region.
“When it comes to ride hailing, Uber is the primary competitor, but between us we’re serving just 1 percent of the opportunity,” he said, “so the biggest challenge is just growing.
“Dubai is a truly global city, but as soon as you leave Dubai for places like Oman or Cairo or many other cities, you realise that public transport infrastructure is not extensive. Plus, in our markets, if you look at the numbers, car ownership is also very low. Transportation is supply-constrained.”
Indeed, while half the world is railing about how Uber has treated women over the years, the challenges are of a decidedly different nature in Careem’s neck of the woods.
While women can drive in some places, in many they cannot, and many simply do not. “Women want to go out to school, college and work but cannot go because there is no car available,” he said. Many rely on fathers, brothers and husbands to get them around. “Transportation and lack of public transport what we are trying to address and reliably remove that constraint.”
Another issue that is perhaps more specific to Careem’s place as a startup mostly focused on emerging markets: payments. The vast majority of consumers either do not have credit or debit cards, or simply prefer to pay in cash, so Careem has had to adjust accordingly.
The company has come up with a mix of interesting solutions, including a network of people in its cities who act as collection managers, taking funds and then paying out drivers. And it also has developed an in-app wallet, where your change can be deposited after a ride if your driver doesn’t have it to hand, and then used for a future trip. The wallet also acts as a credit account for the highest-rated passengers.
There is more leakage on cash, but the hope is that with elements like the in-app virtual wallet, passengers and drivers gradually get more used to using less of it in Careem’s services. “This is the unfortunate reality,” Sheikha said. “Payments is a challenge for a service like ours.”
Careem has been growing at a very quick pace so far. Today it has close to 250,000 drivers (“captains” in Careem’s terminology), 10 million people are signed up and the app is now in 80 cities in the region, covering 13 countries. Revenues and trips are both growing between 20 and 25 percent month on month at the moment, said Sheikha. (As a point of comparison Careem noted 150,000 drivers and less than 50 cities in December.)
While Daimler’s investment is another step in how the carmaker continues to fill out its regional ride-sharing portfolio — notably in a market where Mercedes Benz (part of Daimler) is a very popular make — Sheikha notes that it’s also an opportunity for Careem to tap into some of the technology that Daimler is working on for the next generation of cars.
Dubai’s leader has set a target for 25 percent of all transportation to be in driverless vehicles by 2030, and although Careem has just raised a large round of funding, investing in and developing your own autonomous technology has a very high barrier to entry (indeed, that “AI divide” is a problem that one startup is now trying to tackle). So, one solution is to partner with companies that are not direct competitors who are making those future bets.
Daimler has already been working with Uber on self-driving pilots, and has set a target to have self-driving cars on the road in the next five years, so this will give it one more channel to market: via its strategic investment in Careem.
Another interesting strategic aspect of this round is the fact that not only does Daimler have other transportation startups in its portfolio, but Careem now has multiple investors who also back another big ride-sharing company, Lyft in the US.
There has been a lot of talk about how non-Uber car startups can collaborate more together. And although we’ve actually seen very few (no?) fruits from that labor, Sheikha said that he can see some opportunities in the future to give Careem app users the ability to continue to use their apps when they travel abroad and want to order cars in other markets. (No deals made yet on that front, though.)
Interestingly, having DCM and Coatue participate in this round marks an expansion of Careem’s American investors (Lumia first invested in a previous round). It’s part of a larger trend of investors and tech companies starting to pay a lot more attention to the region as a new growth area. Big deals like Amazon’s acquisition of Souq, and the acquisitions that retail and real estate giant Emaar is making to consolidate regional e-commerce and logistics players, are also both signs of how the strongest startups in the Middle East are sprouting.
“Overall, I feel the Middle East is more on the map than ever before,” Sheikha said. “We always knew the opportunity: 700 million people, 10 percent of global population are here. But the opportunity is so fragmented. There is no one Brazil or India, and infrastructure is still lacking and wealth is unbalanced, but it’s still a big, exciting opportunity.”

262,Trucker Path just lined up $30 million in debt to lend to the truckers on its platform,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/14/trucker-path-just-lined-up-30-million-in-debt-to-lend-to-the-truckers-on-its-platform/,2017/06/14,"
Trucker Path, a  three-year-old, Mountain View-based platform that helps connect drivers, brokers, shippers, and carriers, has just lined up $30 million in debt funding so it can start loaning some of those truckers money right after they deliver their freight.
It’s seemingly a win-win. It means truckers needn’t wait 30 to 60 days to get paid by the vendors who hire them. In the meantime, the loans are a new revenue opportunity for Trucker Path, which is charging its customers slightly more in interest than it’s paying its debt provider: Flexible Funding, a lower-flying, 25-year-old lending institution in San Francisco.
It’s the latest twist in the war to win over the hearts of the 1.6 million long-haul truckers in the U.S., a somewhat stunning 550,000 of whom are already using Trucker Path’s app, according to cofounder and CEO IvanTsybaev.
Why do they use it? Well, partly to communicate to their peers where parking is, and isn’t, available. In fact, it’s one of the stickiest features of the app, which began as a navigational tool but now features everything from crowdsourcing to the ability to track shipments from dispatch to delivery.
While people outside the industry might not grasp what a pain in the butt it is to park a truck, a survey by the Department of Transportation has shown that 75 percent of drivers say they regularly have trouble finding a safe place to park when they need to rest. Meanwhile, using Trucker Path, drivers save 11 hours, or $600, each month, insists Tsybaev. And you can imagine the savings for enterprise customers like Pepsi and FedEx that send out thousands of trucks every day.
Trucker Path is not the only shiny new option in the industry, of course. You’ve probably read about the growing spate of startups looking to elbow aside traditional trucking companies, including Turvo, which we wrote about here, and Uber Freight — a freight broker that’s eventually expected, like Trucker Path, to offer a single platform where brokers, shippers, and carriers can work together in real time.
Tsybaev says his company already has the kind of network effect that can mean the difference between barely surviving and thriving, though, and investors apparently buy his argument. The 60-person company — which has already raised $21.5 million from Renren and Wicklow Capital of Chicago, among others — says it’s right now talking with investors about a Series B round. (It says it’s already fielding sheets, actually.)
The new funding should help on a number of fronts. One new feature the company has been working on is an insurance marketplace for its trucking customers; they’ll gain access to numerous providers that would otherwise have trouble connecting with these individuals but can reach them more easily with Trucker Path’s help.
Trucker Path also says it wants to beef up its enterprise sales force, and to create a fully automated marketplace so truckers won’t have to worry about negotiating with shippers or freight brokers. Indeed, ultimately, says Tsybaev, a trucker will be able to tell Trucker Path’s app how long he or she will be on the road, and it will immediately provide that person with the “right freight at the right price.”
Then, thanks to its new debt facility, it can offer that individual a cash advance.
New equity funding will also come in handy on that front, too. As Tsybaev explains it, the company’s debt lender provides capital for most of every invoice, but Trucker Path also covers a small percentage.
“To scale into a multi-billion dollar business,” adds Tsybaev, and naturally it means to, “we need more capital.”

263,LISNR and PILOT join Jaguar Land Rover incubator,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/14/lisnr-and-pilot-join-jaguar-land-rover-incubator/,2017/06/14,"
Jaguar Land Rover has brought two new startups into its Portland Tech Incubator: LISNR and PILOT Automotive Labs. Previous cohorts at the incubator have ranged from parking apps to drones; these two continue to build on JLR’s creative approach to the automotive future.
LISNR uses ultrasonic audio to transmit data. That’s right — it transmits and receives sounds we can’t hear. LISNR calls them Smart Tones. Any two devices — two vehicles’ black boxes, say, or a car and a pedestrian with an enabled smartphone in their pocket — can send and receive messages once they’re in range of each other. All the devices need is a microphone or a speaker, depending on whether they’re sending or receiving, which keeps their power requirements low.
LISNR is already being used in non-automotive applications, like the Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center. The company was also part of the inaugural AutoMobili-D startup expo at the 2017 North America International Auto Show in Detroit.
PILOT promises to make any car autonomous. A sensor plugin is installed on your car’s roof to take in data. (The sensor is mounted on a roof rack in the image above.) You can use that data to help you improve your driving, like many OBD-II port plug-in devices do, or you can connect it to your steering and braking systems and let it take over some simple driving tasks. It also connects to the cloud to learn of traffic situations and share its data.
PILOT brings some of the current advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to any car, like road sign recognition, lane keep assist, and blind spot monitoring. So using the term “autonomous,” as the startup does on its website, might be a bit premature. This is SAE Level 2 at best. But it is a step toward bringing life-saving collision mitigation technology to cars already on the road.

264,Tesla’s Model X earns all-around 5-star safety rating from NHTSA,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/13/teslas-model-x-earns-all-around-5-star-safety-rating-from-nhtsa/,2017/06/13,"
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has bestowed its highest ever SUV safety rating to Tesla’s Model X. The Model X earned a 5-star rating in every category and sub-category that NHTSA tests, using the government body’s own independent testing process. This also puts the Model X second only to the Model S in terms of overall injury probability to passengers per NHTSA’s ranking system.
This safety performance owes a lot to the unique design of Tesla’s vehicle, due to its electric powertrain. The bottom mounted battery pack, which is spread out across the base of the vehicle, puts the Model X’s center of gravity far lower down and distributed when compared to traditional fuel injection engine SUVs. That lower center of gravity helps immensely in preventing rollovers, which is typically a big weak spot for SUVs, which sit higher up on the road.
NHTSA’s rating system predicts around a 93 percent chance of a passenger in the Model X walking away from serious crashes, to put the high ratings in more relatable terms. That’s a high honor for Tesla, especially in tandem with the Model S reputation (despite some back-pedalling on that count at Consumer Reports related to the auto-braking feature on gen 2 hardware cars, which are getting that via update now).
This means the Model 3 will have big shoes to fill, but if Tesla can pull off a NHTSA trifecta with that vehicle, which is set to start deliveries next month, it should really help secure Tesla’s overall safety reputation as a core competitive value.

265,Tim Cook says Apple’s car project is ‘the mother of all AI projects’,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/13/tim-cook-says-apples-car-project-is-the-mother-of-all-ai-projects/,2017/06/13,"
In a very brief interview with Bloomberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed that the company has been working on an Apple car. This isn’t the first time Apple talked about the company’s ongoing work in the car industry.
Cook described Apple’s car project as the combination of three different factors — self-driving cars, electric vehicles and ride-sharing. Those three things together make the car industry interesting again.
More interestingly, Cook said that Apple is more focused on self-driving technology and not necessarily the car itself. “We’re focusing on… what we talked about we’re focusing on publicly is… We’re focusing on autonomous systems,” he said.
So it looks like Project Titan is still very much a work in progress as Apple needs to figure out the technology before thinking about its marketing strategy.
This part of the interview could also confirm an earlier report that the company has been focusing on building the brain of the device instead of manufacturing fully fledged cars.
“Clearly, one purpose of autonomous systems is self-driving cars — there are others. And we sort of see it as the mother all AI projects,” Cook told Bloomberg. “It’s probably one of the most difficult AI projects to work on. So autonomy is something that is incredibly exciting for us. But we’ll see where it takes us — we’re not really saying from a product point of view what we’ll do. It’s a core technology that we view as very important.”
More recently, Apple got an autonomous vehicle test permit so that the company can start testing self-driving cars on the roads of California. So far, Apple has been using a Lexus SUV with its own sensors and devices.

266,"Autonomous cars are “infants,” but they’re growing up fast",https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/13/autonomous-cars-are-infants-but-theyre-growing-up-fast/,2017/06/13,"
A panel at the MovinOn conference in Montreal, Quebec, tackled the questions that always get tackled: What’s the state of autonomous cars and when will they be fully ready to take over the world? Or, at least, all driving tasks?
Dan Galves, a senior vice president at Mobileye, put it very plainly: the vehicles we have on the roads now are “small fleets of infants” in terms of what they’ve accomplished and what they have yet to learn. Merging in particular is an example of something autonomous cars are really bad at; they can’t discern aggressive drivers from conservative drivers and make choices about when to move into the roundabout like humans can, Galves pointed out.
He expects that the detailed mapping necessary for fully autonomous driving will be ready by 2020 or 2021, which is in line with other expectations. By that time, Galves predicted, autonomous cars will “look normal” instead of having large sensor arrays on the roof. They’ll be “adolescents” that are capable of doing quite a bit on their own but are still in training.
By 2025, autonomous cars will be “adults,” and we will be able to remove the human safety monitor sitting in the front seat and ready to take the wheel. That’s quicker than was predicted a few years ago, but none of Galves’s fellow panelists disagreed.
Joachim Damasky, managing director of Verband der Automobilindustrie in Germany, also said that it would take seven or eight years before fully autonomous cars would be able to tackle urban areas. But automated vehicles — which he was very particular to differentiate — would be ready by next year. These automated vehicles will be able to operate basic functions like steering and speed in controlled situations, such as a divided highway where everyone is driving the same direction (or is supposed to be) and at roughly the same speed.
“We’re not trying to take away driving function if you want to drive, but [we are trying] to make it safe,” Damasky said. Several speakers at the event mentioned the 1.2 million lives lost each year to traffic accidents, 90% of which can be attributed to human error.
But if the human is taken out of the equation, who’s in charge? That’s the regulatory sticking point in the United States, according to David Strickland of the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets (and a former NHTSA administrator). In the United States, the federal government has been in charge of safety standards for vehicles — rules for machines. Likewise, states have been in charge of how those vehicles are operated through laws — rules for humans.
So if the machine takes over the duties of the human, is that the responsibility of the federal government to regulate or the states to regulate? NHTSA has produced guidelines, and the states are approaching autonomous testing piecemeal. Without a clear plan for moving forward, Strickland said, it’s difficult for auto manufacturers — and the startups that partner with them to supply cutting-edge technology — to move forward with confidence and efficiency.

267,Lyft gets $25M and a fleet of cars from new partner Jaguar Land Rover,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/11/lyft-gets-25m-and-a-fleet-of-cars-from-new-partner-jaguar-land-rover/,2017/06/11,"
Lyft recently raised $600 million in a massive funding round, and now we know that $25 million of that came from Jaguar Land Rover, via its mobility services subsidiary InMotion. The car maker’s investment in Lyft goes beyond just funds, however; it’s providing Lyft drivers with a fleet of Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles as part of the tie-up, and it’s also going to work with the ride-hailing tech company on autonomous vehicle testing.
This is yet another high-profile partner for Lyft after a spate of recent new collaborators, including Waymo and, just last week, Nutonomy. Now, Jaguar Land Rover is also joining the company’s Open Platform for autonomous cars: The collaboration with InMotion will see the Jaguar Land Rover-owned company “develop and test its mobility services, including autonomous vehicles” using Lyft’s platform.
Lyft’s ability to rapidly bring on a lot of partners in the car maker space, specifically around autonomy, may have a lot to do with rival Uber’s ongoing problems, which now also include mounting calls for CEO Travis Kalanick to step back, at least temporarily, from his leadership role. Lyft has also been pretty clear about seeking to partner on autonomy, rather than pursue its own tech, which is likewise different from Uber’s current approach.
Uber, too, has brought automakers to the table around self-driving services and making use of its ride hailing platform for mobility service offerings. Both Uber and Lyft seem interested in being the layer that connects riders and these future services, and for automakers, it means leaving a complex and challenging part of the picture to partners with experience and expertise, rather than having to spin up that part of the tech business themselves.
The fleet provision in the deal is also interesting, and suggests the partnership between the two could involve more strategic cooperative service offerings ahead of the advent of commercial self-driving tech. Lyft gaining more ground among automakers beyond longtime partner GM also explain why it was reported that the ride hailing company turned down overtures regarding a potential acquisition by the Detroit-based automaker.

Uber’s Board of Directors has voted unanimously to implement all of the recommendations contained within the report it commissioned from former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and his legal partners Tammy Albarrán. The board met Sunday to discuss the recommendations, which reportedly include a suggestion that Uber SVP Emil Michael, a trusted confidant of CEO Travis Kalanick, be asked to leave the company.
In a statement, a representative for the Board offered the following:
The Uber Board met today with Eric Holder and Tammy Albarrán. The Board unanimously voted to adopt all the recommendations of the Holder Report. The recommendations will be released to the employees on Tuesday.
Uber has been leaking pretty consistently since the report approached its conclusion, with a number of stories appearing last week including one about a senior Uber executive getting a rape victim’s medical records released since an Uber driver perpetrated the crime.
Another report claims that Kalanick is considering at least a temporary departure from the company in the wake of these recent revelations. The board reportedly considered this option during their meeting on Sunday, alongside the recommendations in Holder’s report.
The company will learn the specifics of the recommendations to be adopted Tuesday, and it’s very likely those will also be made public at that time, either through official channels or through the network of leaks that have been providing much of the information regarding the report thus far.

269,Cognata receives $5M to speed up autonomous testing,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/08/cognata-receives-5-to-speed-up-autonomous-testing/,2017/06/08,"
Rand Corporation reported in 2016 that autonomous cars would need to be tested over 11 billion miles in order to prove that they’re better drivers than humans. With a fleet of 100 cars running 24 hours a day, that would take 500 years, according to the report. That seems both improbable and impractical, so companies like Cognata are filling the autonomous vehicle testing void with virtual miles.
The need to establish the reliability of autonomous vehicles in short order has prompted Emerge, Maniv Mobility and Airbus Ventures to invest $5 million in funding in Cognata. The company’s simulation system uses artificial intelligence, deep learning, and computer vision to create a virtual environment for testing cars without drivers — no roads required. It simulates the data collected by the vehicle’s sensors when encountering other vehicles and a variety of road conditions.
Cognata recreates real cities in 3D, starting with San Francisco, with every building and tree in place. Then it layers in data, like traffic models from different cities, to understand how vehicles drive and react in each particular location. “We can see the difference between San Francisco, Bangalore, and London,” said CEO Danny Atsmon in a phone interview. The third layer of Cognata’s virtual test is the emulation of the 40 or so sensors that autonomous vehicles require, including cameras, lidar and GPS. These simulations are run using the computers provided by the auto manufacturer or Tier 1 supplier in a far safer environment than, say, the street you live on.

Because the tests are run using Cognata’s cloud platform, “we can drive millions of miles in a few hours,” Atsmon said. “We can take hundreds of thousands of instances to run hundreds of thousands of scenarios,” including things like false positives from the sensors, “in a few hours or sometimes a few days.”
Before founding Cognata, Atsmon was the director of ADAS and machine learning at Harman — now part of Samsung — which supplies manufacturers with connected car solutions. (You might know the company better for its Harman Kardon sound systems.) Atsmon’s goal in founding the autonomous vehicle testing company after leaving Harman was to create a scalable way to test cutting-edge technology in less time and for less money than deploying a fleet of vehicles on the road. It’s also far safer.
“Because we are creating things virtually, we can recreate full cities — even the cities where autonomous driving is not allowed yet,” Atsmon said. “We can bridge that gap so that those cities will be more ready when they do allow it.”

270,Judge denies Uber’s request for stay in Waymo suit,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/07/uber-waymo-lawsuit-stay-denied/,2017/06/07,"
The judge in the lawsuit between Uber and Waymo, the self-driving car subsidiary of Google’s parent company Alphabet, denied Uber’s request for a stay pending its appeal for arbitration. That means the case is still on track to go to trial in early October, as previously planned.
In court today, District Judge William Alsup of the Northern District of California re-affirmed the court date, put a limit on new discovery requests and urged both parties in the case to figure out their differences on that front.
Finally, Alsup defended his earlier order for Uber to do everything in its power to get Anthony Levandowski, the engineer at the center of the case, to comply with discovery requests and to return any confidential material he may have taken from Waymo before leaving the company.
Waymo alleges Levandowski stole trade secrets related to its autonomous driving technology, which were later used in the creation of his own self-driving truck startup Otto. Because Uber acquired Otto for nearly $700 million last summer, the implication is that those trade secrets found their way into Uber’s own autonomous driving unit.
Uber had previously argued — unsuccessfully — that the lawsuit should head to arbitration due to a clause in Levandowski’s employment contract. It later appealed that decision and was seeking a stay in the case while the appeals process was underway. Alsup’s ruling this morning effectively denied a pause in the proceedings while waiting for an appeals court to hear the case, and also re-affirmed an October 2 court date for the trial to get underway.
With less than four months between now and the scheduled proceedings, Alsup also urged both parties to limit the scope of the suit, put a limit on discovery requests and move forward in complying with existing requests.
Speaking to the counsel for Waymo, Alsup also suggested the company severely curtail — or drop entirely — the patent claims it’s making as part of the case.
“I think you’re going to lose on all these patent claims unless you pull a rabbit out of a hat,” Alsup said. “You’re the one who wants the trial date… You’re the one who should streamline this.” 
Otherwise, he argued, “you’ll burn up a lot of time and effort for things that will end up as a distraction.” Instead, he suggested Waymo counsel spend more time and energy trying to obtain the documents Waymo claims were part of the due diligence process in the Uber-Otto acquisition to find out what Uber knew and when.
On the flip side, Alsup said Uber’s defense would depend on showing that the alleged trade secrets Waymo has accused Levandowski of stealing were not secrets after all, but part of the public domain and something that any good autonomous engineer would know.
Much of today’s hearing was focused on the discovery aspect of the case, which Alsup has (for the most part) turned over to Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley. Still, Uber counsel argued that the nature of Waymo’s discovery process was onerous, citing 265 requests that it is already trying to respond to, as well as additional follow-ups it expects.
In response, Alsup once again referred all document discovery requests to the magistrate and the special master, and told the parties there should be no more document requests until further notice. 
Finally, Alsup turned to the topic of Levandowski, specifically the argument that the court’s order compelling Uber to get him to turn over any documents taken from Waymo unconstitutionally violated his fifth amendment rights against self-incrimination.
Following a court order, Uber threatened Levandowski with termination if he did not comply with its investigation and return any Waymo-owned materials to his previous employer. When he failed to comply by Uber’s deadline, the company followed through on its threat and fired Levandowski late last month.
Because of this, Levandowski’s counsel argued that an agent of the government was forcing a private citizen to choose between his Fifth Amendment rights and continued employment.
After hearing from counsel for Levandowski, Uber and Waymo, Alsup ruled from the bench. The issue was moot, he said, because “Uber had its own investigation going and for its own reasons found that Mr. Levandowski should be fired for not complying with that investigation.”
Alsup implored those in court to consider what kind of mischief would arise if people working at private companies could claim the Fifth Amendment when party to any internal investigation and could remain employed while not complying with those investigations.
“A private employer… can say to its employee, ‘Either you comply with this investigation or we can terminate you,’ ” Alsup said. As a result, he said he continues to stand behind the previous order and would not change anything about it.

271,US Route 33 to test V2I tech,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/07/us-route-33-to-test-v2i-tech/,2017/06/07,"
When you think of central Ohio, you might not think “hotbed of innovation.” But you’re going to want to rethink that. This summer, a 35-mile stretch of U.S. Route 33 outside of Marysville, Ohio, will be wired to test vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communications.
“A year ago, we had zero plan for all this,” said Eric Phillips in a phone interview. He’s the executive director for the Union County Community Improvement Corporation and the CEO of the Union County Chamber of Commerce. “It started as a fiber connectivity project.”
Marysville is an exurb of Columbus, which won $50 million in funding for its Smart Columbus project. Columbus is also home to Ohio State University, which is working on a smart mobility initiative. Honda‘s manufacturing base for North America is just northwest of Marysville. And the Transportation Research Center and NHTSA Vehicle Research Test Center are at the opposite end of the corridor in East Liberty. Along this stretch of Route 33 between East Liberty and Dublin lies a cluster of about 50 other automotive businesses.
So the idea began with connectivity. But researchers at OSU wondered if it was possible to improve mobility options without “adding lanes all the time,” as Phillips put it. This was an opportunity to test connected autonomous vehicles along a route stacked with interested parties.
With a $6 million grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation, local matching funds and a $15 million investment from Ohio, the NW 33 Innovation Corridor was born. It will indeed begin with the installation of redundant fiber cable, and DSRC transmitters will be in place by the end of 2018. Government and private fleet vehicles will be retrofitted with equipment to communicate with the corridor and each other.
Other companies, including Honda, can also use the corridor to test V2I communications in real-world conditions. Phillips acknowledged that collecting data on Route 33 “can be boring” compared to testing in city-like “playgrounds.” But semi-autonomous and autonomous vehicles are likely to be used on boring roads before they’re allowed in urban areas.
Testing will begin when the pieces are in place to do so. Phillips said DSRC transmitters will be spaced every 600 meters along the route. Autonomous and connected vehicles can take advantage of the route, including those that can “platoon” one behind another. It also gives businesses the opportunity to collect data and test commercialization strategies.
Wind River, for instance, announced today that it will be using the 33 Smart Corridor to test connected and autonomous technologies in partnership with OSU, the Transportation Research Center and the city of Dublin. In its press release, Wind River, a subsidiary of Intel that specializes in software for the Internet of Things, notes that Central Ohio is an emerging hub for smart city and smart vehicle tech.
“We can’t keep adding lanes to highways,” Phillips reiterated, noting that car sharing will play a role in traffic congestion in the future, as well. “All I’ve heard is positive; I have not heard anything negative about this,” he said of his community. “Businesses are very excited about the opportunity.”
As Phillips pointed out, “We have a strong automotive industry, and we’ve got to support its growth. We’ve got to keep up. Electric vehicles are only one part [of the future of transportation]; the other is mobility and how to improve it. We have to accept it in order to not be way behind.”

272,Delphi and Transdev to develop global on-demand driverless transportation,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/07/delphi-and-transdev-to-develop-global-on-demand-driverless-transportation/,2017/06/07,"
Dance cards are filling up for the coming autonomous driving revolution: The newest partners are Delphi and Transdev, who are joining forces to create an automated, on-demand mobility systems, with a service offering set to make its debut via pilot projects in France, and then to eventually expand eventually to global reach.
Delphi will be bringing its automated driving platform to the mix, which it’s creating in partnership with Mobileye; meanwhile, Transdev is a recognized leader in mobility network operation, and already works with public transit authorities around the word, including trams, light rail, buses, ferries, and more recently, autonomous vehicles. Transdev boasts 83,000 employees, and operates 40,000 vehicles across 19 countries across all five continents – so even if it’s new to you (as it was to me), they’ve got positioning in the industry that few can claim to match.
This is one of the most ambitious of the currently announced autonomous mobility service projects, since both Delphi and Transdev are stating up front that they want to eventually have a global footprint with their offering. The companies are also going to be working on getting pilot projects operating very quickly.
Transdev is already started work on an autonomous on-demand service pilot in Normandy (depicted in the video below), and this will give it and Delphi the chance to test all aspects of the planned platform, from dispatch to sensor fusion and intelligence. This will be open to members of the public from project outset, and will provide public transport where there isn’t currently an option available today.

Then, in Paris-Saclay, both companies will work together to launch a “first mile, last mile” service operating between a railway station and a nearby campus. The goal with that pilot is to launch two cars and one shuttle prior to the end of this year, and then to grow the fleet beyond that. The goal is to not have a driver present in the vehicle at all as soon as possible, explained Yann Leriche, Chief Performance Officer at Transdev on a call announcing the news, though initially there will be a technical driver monitoring on board.
“We believe that autonomy will bring a lot of social benefits,” Leriche said. “Our mission is to leverage those benefits to provide attractive shared transportation options to our clients. The asset can be shared, for example on-demand cars, or the ride can be shared, for example, buses.”
For Delphi, this partnership will provide access to testing on a wide range of vehicle types across a wide variety of service settings, and it gives them someone to work with who already has a deep functional understanding of current urban transit and the challenges therein. It’s a perspective that not even more modern ride hailing service operators like Uber or Lyft necessarily have, especially when it comes to partnerships with urban transit authorities.

“They have that clear pathway, they’re operating today, they understand this and we couldn’t be more excited to be adding them as a partner,” Glen De Vos, Delphi’s Chief Technology Officer, said on the call. “We really have line of sight into how the technology can be deployed, and deployed in a way that really makes sense in terms of safety and in terms of commercial operations.”
Both companies will say they’ll contribute to the co-development of future autonomous vehicles (along with vehicle manufacturing partners), as well as infrastructure to make operating a commercial service sustainable and scalable. The end goal is to get the service to market for public consumption by 2019. By 2018, the test projects should be operating without a safety driver on board, and will instead be managed remotely by a central control operator, according to Leriche. This would be the first autonomous service without drivers on board on open roads.
Delphi, a long-time auto industry supplier, recently announced that it would split off its powertrain company into its own unit in order to focus more fully on EV tech and autonomous vehicles. Transdev provides “deep understanding of the consumer experience,” however, according to De Vos, since it interfaces with the public in its existing business very frequently.
Already, Leriche said that Transdev is testing in autonomy, but it’s looking to Delphi to help it bring those services to the open road. Delphi will help in this manner because of its proven autonomous driving platform.

273,Bosch to create radar road “signature” maps for high accuracy self-driving,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/07/bosch-to-create-radar-road-signature-maps-for-high-accuracy-self-driving/,2017/06/07,"
Bosch will be teaming up with TomTom to create a new kind of high-resolution localized maps that incorporate a “radar road signature” generated by Bosch, which can help position cars in their surroundings to within a few centimeters (that’s less than an inch in Imperial terms). It supplements video data previously used for this purpose, and has the advantage of working in poor visibility conditions and in bad weather, where cameras don’t necessarily fare all that well.
Amazingly, the data used to transmit this information to vehicles is only about half that sent when using video, which makes it a more efficient choice for networking purposes, too. That’s always a consideration among automakers, since data transmission is a cost they have to factor into the overall price of providing autonomous tech. The plan currently is to start getting this data from vehicles beginning in 2020, at the “latest,” according to Bosch.
Vehicles will contribute to the map making in high volume, once the tech is put in place. This involves fielding cars with modified versions of Bosch’s previous radar sensors, since those were designed to work with today’s advanced driver assistance feature, and activated upon detecting motion. To perform this kind of updating, evolving high-resolution mapping work, Bosch changed the design for constant performance, as opposed to activity-based triggering.
The mapping solution will be made up of localization information, to help cars figure out where they are positioned within a lane; a planning layer, to help predict the upcoming course of the vehicle, and a dynamic layer, which includes real-time info about construction work, parking spaces and traffic back-ups. Info from sources including Bosch’s radar units will be crucial to making this work properly.
The “radar road signature” being developed by Bosch will work with any “conventional mapping format,” the company notes, so it could potentially make its way to a lot more places, especially as mapping becomes key to rolling out autonomous vehicles safely and effectively. Since Bosch is one of the world’s leading supplier for automakers when it comes to this kind of radar hardware, those maps should have great coverage, too.

Tesla says that it should be able to deliver its first production Model 3 next month, and also noted that it’ll reveal the Model 3 configurator at that time. The configurator won’t offer a lot of choice, however – Tesla CEO Elon Musk said at a shareholder meeting on Tuesday that it’ll basically let you pick “what color” and “what size wheels” you want.
The plan is to reveal additional configuration options over time, but Musk noted that this simplification came from lessons learned from the launch of the Model X, which offered way too many options initially, increasing manufacturing complexity significantly. The Model 3 configuration has intentionally been kept simple at launch to help with production volume, but reveals of other configuration options will happen on a staged timeline after the company makes sure it gets everything right.
There’s a large backlog that Tesla needs to get through, Musk noted at the meeting, which is a good reason to keep things simple. He said that if you pre-order a Model 3 today, you likely won’t receive a car until “the end of next year,” and he added that the line is only growing, so that delay shouldn’t discourage anyone from putting down cash towards a reservation.

Henrik Fisker, who’s been teasing his new electric vehicle company after a stutter step first attempt with the original Fisker co. and the Karma, is back with the EMotion, the first car from Fisker Inc. The EMotion gets its first official eyes-on today via photos, not renders, that show us the vehicle in the aluminum and carbon fiber, finally.
The car also gets its official pricing for the first time: $129,900 to start, which is in line with the ‘north of $100K’ pricing info we’d been hearing. That price includes an “ultra-large” battery pack, which makes possible its 400+ mile electric range, and upper speed of 161 mph.
Fisker Inc. still isn’t looking to ship this car before 2019, but as you can see, it’s come a long way in terms of industrial design. Pre-orders kick off on June 30, too, with more details to be revealed this month in order to drum up interest from those willing to put down some early cash.
Here’s what we do know about the car now, from the company itself: It’s built using carbon fiber and aluminum, has a patented, unique “frontal crash structure” designed to boost safety, uses carbon fiber and aluminum wheels for decreased mass and higher range, and uses patented fast charge tech to achieve 100 miles of range in nine minutes. It also has a healthy selection on onboard sensors, including LiDAR and mirror cameras that enable 360-degree optical sensing. Fisker is teaming up with The Hybrid Shop to offer customers white glove service, too, the company says.

Danish-born Fisker originally helped design a range of iconic cars including the Aston Martin DB9 and V8 Vantage. Fisker’s design firm also contributed to the original design of the Tesla Model S, before he began his own EV company called Fisker Automotive. That company eventually fizzled due to bankruptcy and sold to Chinese auto parts firm Wanxiang, where it was rebranded as Karma Automotive.
Fisker, Inc. is a completely new, separate entity, but it’s hard not to consider its founder’s last attempt at building an EV company when considering its chances. Still, the design chops are solid, so more than a few car and EV buffs out there will be watching to see the Emotion’s full reveal.

276,Bozoma Saint John heads to Uber from Apple,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/06/bozoma-saint-john/,2017/06/06,"
Last week, ahead of WWDC, there was a ripple of news when Axios discovered that Bozoma Saint John — one of the more noticeable execs at the company for being a woman of color, who led an Apple Music demo at the previous year’s WWDC to some acclaim — was leaving Apple. Now TechCrunch has learned where she’s landing: she’s going to Uber.
We received the news via a tip, and have confirmed the appointment through multiple sources at Uber. The company, we understand, views the appointment as important in helping “turn the tide on recent issues.”
As for what role she will be taking, that’s something we’re still trying to figure out. We understand that Uber will be making more details public later. Saint John’s track record is in marketing — most recently at Apple but also with a long stint at Pepsi, among other places. [Update: she’s Uber’s new Chief Brand Officer, the company announced later.]
The appointment is a key move for Uber that could help shore up confidence in the company both internally and externally as it fights to justify its $70 billion valuation by investors.
Uber has been under fire for months for its management practices and company culture. Some critics and competitors have looked to drive business away from the company with a #deleteuber campaign (which has been working to some extent).
In terms of executive news, most of it in the last six months has been about departures rather than hires. Those who have left Uber in recent times have included the VP of maps and business platform Brian McClendon, president Jeff Jones, AI lead Gary Marcus, communications SVP Rachel Whetstone, VP of global vehicle programs Sherif Marakby, VP of product Ed Baker, SVP of engineering Amit Singhal and self-driving car head Anthony Levandowski.
Saint John, who had been head of global and consumer marketing for iTunes and Apple Music, was a surprise hit at last year’s WWDC conference. Her charismatic appearance on stage not only gave the dad-joke peppered event a little more oomph, but it also underscored a bigger conversation we’ve been having in the tech industry about diversity, strong role models and which companies have been taking a leadership position in that area.
Uber’s record on diversity is not brilliant — but as we have pointed out it’s not the worst, either — and hiring Saint John speaks to how this continues to evolve.
Regardless of whether she takes a marketing role or something else, Saint John coming on board is part of Uber’s efforts to reposition itself as a different kind of company than it has been in the past.
That repositioning has been ongoing. Just yesterday the company announced a new hire, Frances Frei, an academic from Harvard Business School, taking a new role as SVP of leadership and strategy. There is also a report coming soon with the results of an investigation led by former Attorney General Eric Holder into the company’s management culture — which was spurred by allegations of sexism and other criticisms of company culture.
Amidst the bad news, Uber continues to see growth. In the first quarter of this year, revenues were up 18 percent over the previous quarter to $3.4 billion while losses were $708 million, down from over $900 million the quarter before. Between Q3 and Q4 of last year, Uber grew by 74 percent. (Note: seasonal fluctuations — Q4 is the holiday season — are part of the reason for this drastic shift, and Uber has not released year-on-year figures.)

277,Lyft and Nutonomy partner to bring first self-driving Lyft service to Boston,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/06/lyft-and-nutonomy-partner-to-bring-first-self-driving-lyft-service-to-boston/,2017/06/06,"
Lyft has another partners in the world of autonomous vehicles, its third behind GM and Waymo if you’re keeping count. The newest partner is Nutonomy, the Boston-based autonomous vehicle technology company that made waves by being first to real roads with a self-driving taxi – thanks to a team-up with Singapore’s economic development board. Now, Nutonomy and Lyft are launching a self-driving ride hailing service closer to home – in Boston, where a pilot project will see a couple of cars begin picking up riders sometime in the coming months.
During a press call to discuss the new partnership, Lyft co-founder and CEO Logan Green noted that his company believes ride sharing will account for “over 80 percent of all miles traveled” within a couple of decades, and that the way this will happen is via autonomous vehicle tech. That’s why it’s entering into this partnership with Nutonomy, he said, which, in its first stage, will focus on the passenger experience.
Both Nutonomy and Lyft are relatively inexperienced when it comes to actually transporting passengers in self-driving vehicles, as Nutonomy CEO and co-founder Karl Iagnemma noted on the call. So, too, is basically everyone, however, since this is relatively untrodden territory.
“We don’t really know in detail how riders are going to engage with autonomous vehicles because, frankly, we just don’t have that much experience,” Iagnemma said. That’s why they’ll be looking to use this partnership to gather data on rider interaction with the service, from hailing, to meeting their vehicle, to in-car experience and more. Green noted that it’ll focus on the entire “end-to-end” rider journey, and will include a new extension of the Lyft app that appears in-car on tablets mounted within the vehicles used for the pilot.
Those cars will initially be a small number of Renault Zoe EVs, which Nutonomy began road-testing in Boston starting last November. Iagnemma confirmed that Nutonomy engineers are already working on integrating Lyft software into “a couple of” vehicles, to be deployed sometime “in the coming months,” for actual customer pickups, though no more specific timeline was given.
Green and Iagnemma noted that long-term, the companies hope to field “thousands” of Nutonomy vehicles on Lyft’s ride hailing network. Green wouldn’t comment specifically on how this partnership will or won’t impact existing work with GM and Waymo, only noting that each are completely separate agreements, each “very different” in nature.
The two are a good fit because they’re both “safety first organizations,” too, according to Green. But neither is ready yet to discuss exactly how riders from Lyft’s user pool will be selected to take part in the trial – Uber’s debut Pittsburgh service, which was open to regular riders, would alert customers that they’d be receiving an autonomous test vehicle after their trip was confirmed, and it’s likely Lyft will do something similar.
This partnership is also all about mutual benefit; no money is changing hands in either direction as a result of the deal.
“There is no financial arrangement between the two companies,” Logan confirmed. “It’s a collaborative, R&D-based partnership.”
In addition to its new collaborative effort with Lyft, Nutonomy recently announced a partnership with Peugot owner PSA for autonomous vehicle testing in Singapore. Iagnemma noted on the call that this is designed to ultimately help integrate Nutonomy’s tech in a range of PSA vehicles that can eventually be run on ride hailing platforms like Lyft’s, once they become more prevalent.
Meanwhile, Lyft has previously been reported to have plans to bring pilot self-driving taxi tests to market starting sometime next year, and earlier this year, it announced a new partnership with Waymo to work on public introduction of self-driving tech. Ultimately, there’s no reason for it to limit its partners on the autonomy software or hardware side, since it’ll likely hope to open its ride hailing network to a range of partners instead of limiting itself and its profit potential.

278,Toyota’s flying car project takes a tentative test flight,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/04/toyotas-flying-car-project-takes-a-tentative-test-flight/,2017/06/04,"

Toyota is working on developing flying cars, with the aim of having a single driver vehicle ready to fly in time for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. The idea is that a small flying car will be able to smoothly transition from driving to the skies, in order to delivery the Olympic torch for its last leg to officially open the games.
The project isn’t yet ready to dazzle the world, as you can see in the Associated Press video above. This early prototype of the car is basically structural scaffolding, batteries and rotors, but it does manage to get about head height before ungracefully returning to earth.
The flying car is being created in partnership with Cartivator Resource Management, a small tech company that Toyota invested nearly $400,000 in to help bring this project to life. This test flight took place at a school field in central Japan, near Toyota’s own home base.
Toyota has been exploring a range of new tech and transportation options, including luxury yachts under its Lexus brand. The company is also re-imagining itself as an energy concern — though it just ended a partnership with Tesla it had entered into to co-develop electric vehicle technologies last week.
Next steps for the flying car project include refining the design using the new money invested by Toyota, and hoping to fly with a pilot on board sometime in 2019, ahead of the intended launch of a fully functional vehicle in time for Tokyo’s 2020 Olympic games.

Alphabet-owned Waymo, the autonomous driving technology that began life as Google’s self-driving car project, is evaluating a move into self-driving trucking. The company told BuzzFeed that it’s currently conducting a “technical exploration” of how its “technology can integrate into a truck,” a test which involves use of a single truck, being driven only by people in order to collect data at this stage.
Waymo has not talked about any specific interest in the world of autonomous trucking prior to now, but one of its former employees, Anthony Levandowski, founded a self-driving transport trucking company called Otto upon his departure. Levandowski’s company was acquired by Uber, which put the former Google employee in charge of its self-driving engineering operations, but he was fired earlier this week for continually refusing to comply with Uber’s own internal investigation related to a Waymo suit that accused him of stealing Google employees and trade secrets.
Self-driving trucking is considered one of the lower-hanging fruits of the self-driving industry, since it involves relatively uncomplicated navigation of long stretches of highway driving. A hybrid model, in which a human driver is still present and ready to take over once trucks enter city driving scenarios, is a popular option being pursued in the sector as a way to make practical commercial use of the technology much more easily attainable. A startup called Embark recently debuted with this model, and is approved to test autonomous truck tech on Nevada roads.
Waymo recently kicked off public trials of an on-demand autonomous ride hailing service in Phoenix, Arizona, using its current generation self-driving Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans.

280,Intel CEO explains why he spent $15 billion on Mobileye,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/01/intel-ceo-explains-why-he-spent-15-billion-on-mobileye/,2017/06/01,"
Intel CEO Brian Krzanich was interviewed at Code Conference on Thursday, where he talked about his long-term vision for automobiles. He said his prediction that “the car of the future is going to look much more like a server” was a driving factor in their recent acquisition of Mobileye, the Israeli auto startup for which Intel paid more than $15 billion. 
Krzanich said that someday “if you get a ransomware or some kind of virus on one portion of the device,” Intel will not only have backups, but they could “refresh your car on the fly.” While he acknowledged that there are some potential privacy concerns, Krzanich believes that connected cars will be “much safer.”
“In order for those cars to drive, they do have to look,” said Krzanich about self-driving cars. “There’s a lot of social good that can come out of this.”
He hoped that automotive technology will someday help with situations like Amber Alerts, where they could locate the whereabouts of missing children. “We’re really trying to understand how data will be adjusted and how can you apply artificial intelligence,” he said.
Shortly after his presentation, Intel released its findings that autonomous driving will result in a $7 trillion boon to the economy by 2050. Their reasoning is that “autonomous driving and smart city technologies will enable the new passenger economy, gradually reconfiguring entire industries and inventing new ones thanks to the time and the cognitive surplus it will unlock.”
These predictions were similar to Marc Andreessen’s, who proclaimed at Code Conference that self-driving cars would result in the creation of suburbs further away from cities, because the commutes will be more tolerable. Building these cities would create a lot of jobs, he surmised.

Baidu has two new German auto industry heavyweights on its side in the race to develop autonomous driving technology. Both Bosch and Continental are now partnered up with the Chinese internet giant to work together on not only automated driving, but also on connected cars in general and mobility services.
Both Continental and Bosch are key auto industry suppliers, and this partnership is about Baidu leveraging its experience in machine learning and computer intelligence tech, while its new partners within the industry will focus on spurring the hardware component and systems integration piece of the autonomous systems picture.
Bosch, which is a Tier 1 supplier to essentially every auto maker of significance in existence, and Continental, while best known for its tires, also works on advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) as well as the sensors used in automated driving.
Bosch has also been developing automated driving technologies since 2011, the company says. As part of the agreement, Bosch will be providing sensors, other hardware components and vehicle localization support for Baidu’s Apollo open autonomous driving platform.
These are key partners as Baidu begins to figure out how to commercialize its self-driving tech, which is what Apollo is all about. The platform would be available to OEs and other auto industry players, providing off-the-shelf vehicle autonomy without the heavy lifting.

It’s not really a “shift to mobile” as much as “the addition of mobile”, since desktop usage hasn’t declined much while mobile usage has skyrocketed to over three hours per day per person in the US
There’s still more time spent on mobile than ad spend, indicating forthcoming windfalls for mobile ad platforms
Google and Facebook control 85% of online ad growth
Internet ad spend will surpass TV spend within six months
Streaming music led by Spotify surpassed physical music sales, giving recorded music its first revenue growth in 16 years
eSports are exploding,  with viewing time up 40% year over year, and an equal number of millennials strongly preferring eSports vs traditional sports
Email spam with malicious attachments is exploding as cloud usage increases, so be careful what you click
Tech companies drive wealth creation in China, where people pay for livestreaming, and bike sharing usage is skyrocketing
Falling data costs are driving increasing Internet adoption in India, but smartphone prices remain too high

284,Waze to expand Carpool service across California on June 6,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/31/waze-to-expand-carpool-service-across-california-on-june-6/,2017/05/31,"
Google’s Waze is growing its Carpool offering, expanding the ride-sharing service to all of California after successful trials in San Francisco, Sacramento and Monterey. The service expansion also comes after Waze has been running carpooling services in Israel, where it originally debuted the offering back in 2015. Carpool will open to all California residents beginning Tuesday, June 6.
Waze still exists primarily as a mapping and navigation app that focuses on community engagement, asking users to report things like road hazards and bad weather and then pooling that data and sharing it with other users, and with parent company Google’s own Maps. But Carpool takes that community aspect of the app a bit further, letting drivers actually offer up rides to people who happen to be heading in their direction.
It works by connecting drivers using the regular Waze app with riders using the Waze Carpool app, both of which are available on either Android or iOS. Drivers can opt in to Waze Carpool easily via the bottom right tab of their navigation app, provided they’re 21 years of age. Rides are capped at two per day, since Waze Carpool isn’t aiming to replace professional ride hailing apps like Uber and Lyft, and drivers make no more than $0.54 per mile. That price is determined by the federal standard mileage rate, and is only intended to help drivers share the cost of gas with their riders, rather than enabling them to turn driving into a profession or significant money-making opportunity.

Waze’s whole philosophy around Carpool is that it can offer a method to make actual carpooling more achievable. Office carpools organized in person were a nice idea when they first started gaining ground during the Second World War, but interest dropped off a lot before the Internet came around and made it easier to connect people going the same way.
Waze thinks its network dynamics make it a good candidate to bring people together for quick and easy carpooling, and it does seem logical that a network which has succeeded primarily because users have demonstrated a desire to help each other on the road would lend itself to that.
Earlier this year, Waze’s Noam Bardin signaled that the company hoped to broaden Carpool’s availability to more U.S. cities this year, and this statewide launch certainly accomplishes that. The company also still plans to bring the service to Brazil sometime in 2017, as Bardin noted back in February.

285,Uber fires Otto co-founder Anthony Levandowski due to Waymo dispute,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/30/uber-fires-otto-co-founder-anthony-levandowski-due-to-waymo-dispute/,2017/05/30,"
Uber has terminated the employment of Anthony Levandowski, the co-founder of self-driving trucking company Otto and Uber’s former self-driving project engineering lead. The New York Times reported first on Levandowski’s firing, which was made official to employees via an internal staff email circulated on Tuesday.
Levandowski is at the heart of an ongoing legal battle between Uber and Waymo, the Alphabet company that resulted from Google’s self-driving car project. Waymo accused Levandowski of hatching a plan to use trade secrets related to Waymo’s in-house development of unique LiDAR tech to kickstart Otto’s and subsequently Uber’s own self-driving technology program.
During the court proceedings, Levandowski exercised his Fifth Amendment rights to avoid providing testimony or handing over evidence regarding his use of proprietary data from his time at Google. Uber had previously warned that Levandowski could face consequences for his lack of compliance with his employment requirements at the company.
Uber confirmed via a spokesperson that Levandowski was terminated following months of the company attempting to have him comply with and assist its own internal investigation into the matter, and had set a clear deadline for him to do so. Uber also noted that Eric Meyhofer, who stepped in when Levandowski was removed from his role leading ATG in April, will continue to lead the team and take over Levandowski’s direct reports.

286,Yandex’s on-demand taxi service debuts its self-driving car project,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/30/yandexs-on-demand-taxi-service-debuts-its-self-driving-car-project/,2017/05/30,"

Russia search and internet technology giant Yandex is showing off the self-driving vehicle prototype developed by its Yandex.Taxi on-demand ride service for the first time, and the video above is the first footage of the car in action. The prototype is meant to help Yandex test its software, which the company thinks it’s uniquely well-positioned to develop for this emerging space.
Yandex notes that it has navigation, geolocation, computer vision, and machine learning expertise from other ongoing products and services, including Yandex.Navigator and Yandex.Maps.
“We use anonymised data that we receive from Yandex.Navigator users, which allows us to understand how to drive in a city with its traffic congestion, accidents, speed limits, road closures and other traffic events,” Yandex.Taxi Head of PR Vladimir Isaev explained via email. “We have been using computer vision technologies in a number of our services for quite a while. We use them to find vacant parking spaces or read road signs, for instance, in our geolocation services.”
Expertise with computer vision use at Yandex comes from matching similar images for search results, and for translating text within a photo through its language service offerings. As a result of its combined software development efforts, as well as recent work on applying said tech to the automotive space, Yandex’s self-driving software for its prototype vehicle is developed completely in house, the company tells me.
Also, you may have noticed the lingering shot on that Nvidia GTX GPU in the car, as well as that Velodyne LiDAR unit up top: Yandex says it’s using its own “custom-built” hardware as well as mass market, generally available components for now, but it’s in talks with partners regarding the creation of fit-for-purpose automotive grade hardware down the road.
The vehicle in the video isn’t yet navigating real city streets, but Yandex says that testing is coming on public roads within a year, if all goes as planned. It’s too early yet for any projections regarding commercial service availability, however, Isaev tells me. Eventually, the company hopes to partner with car manufacturers and others looking to bring autonomous vehicles to market.

287,Uber board reportedly receiving Eric Holder’s report this week,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/29/uber-board-reportedly-receiving-eric-holders-report-this-week/,2017/05/29,"
Uber’s board of directors will reportedly hear the results of former Attorney General Eric Holder’s investigation into its workplace culture on Wednesday, according to Axios. The investigation by Holder was announced after former Uber employee Susan Fowler published a blog post detailing her own experience at the company, including accounts of sexual harassment and workplace discrimination.
Holder and colleague Tammy Albarran, who are partners at law firm Covington & Burling, are leading the investigation, which will report its results to the full board. Since its outset, Holder’s team has been reporting weekly with updates to an Uber board subcommittee, including David Bonderman, Bill Gurley and Arianna Huffington, on the investigation’s progress. In April, Holder and Albarran requested more time to complete their investigation, which Huffington at the time noted consists of info received from “hundreds of employees.”
At the time, Huffington noted that the revised timing for the delivery of the report’s results was the “end of May,” which fits with a presentation later this week. The results of the report will be made public once received by Uber’s board, according to comments made by Huffington during a press call in March discussing the steps Uber has taken to address its workplace culture and employment practices. Axios notes that the timing of the report’s reception could change given the recent passing of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick’s mother, which occurred during a boating accident this past weekend.

288,Roborace autonomous car takes a lap in Paris,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/26/roborace-autonomous-car-takes-a-lap-in-paris/,2017/05/26,"
At the Formula E Paris ePrix over the weekend, the driverless Roborace navigated a lap of the 1.9 km course all by itself — all 14 turns.
The autonomous car uses five lidar sensors, two radar sensors, 18 ultrasonic sensors, two optical speed sensors, six AI cameras and satellite positioning information to know where it is and navigate its route. All this data is processed by Nvidia’s Drive PX2, which can perform 24 trillion operations per second, according to a Roborace press release.
Which is fast. The Roborace car itself, however, is not. Yet.
The hardware is on board for some serious racing: four 300 kW motors and a 540 kW battery that can propel the car over 200 mph. But while it’s learning its route — and while the engineers are learning how the car learns — it fairly creeps along the track with a human-driven chaperone car following behind.
Check out the official video to see its first run in Paris. It’ll take another lap in Berlin during the next Formula E race and at races for the rest of the season.

This looks like a scooter, but it’s actually the BMW Motorrad Concept Link, the latest in BMW’s series of exhaustingly named Motorrad concept vehicles, which imagine a not-so distant future in which we all travel around in angular, sci-fi style.
The Link offers an electric drive, which makes possible the lower seat that BMW says facilitates easily getting on and off the vehicle. It has a reverse gear, which is not typical of many motorcycles, letting you negotiate city spaces more easily. There’s onboard storage under the seat bench, and it has cutaways that let you see the technology powering it within.

There’s no instrument cluster on the Link, but that’s because it projects information like speed, remaining charge and navigation information right onto the windscreen. The windscreen can also be swapped out for other options for greater personalization. There’s also a secondary display below the handle bars that offers touchscreen input, and the handlebars have built-in touch sensitive controls for easy access to favorite features while en route.
BMW goes beyond the bike to include a design for rider equipment, including a lightweight jacket with hidden protection. There’s also motion controls built in that let you open the luggage door with a wave of your arm.
These Motorrad concepts aren’t likely to enter production anytime soon, but instead provide some insight into where BMW thinks the industry is headed. I could go for a flash future scooter, so this one makes sense to me.

290,Judge orders Uber to hand over to Waymo unredacted term sheet with Otto,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/25/judge-orders-uber-to-hand-over-unredacted-term-sheet-with-otto-to-waymo/,2017/05/25,"
Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley ordered Thursday that Uber needs to hand over to Waymo, by the end of the day, the full, unredacted term sheet between Uber and Otto. Corley ultimately decided there was no basis for Uber to redact the information because there was no privileged information shared with Otto prior to the acquisition.
“I don’t see any basis whatsoever for those redactions to be made and for that information to be withheld from Waymo,” Corley said.
Since Google’s Waymo self-driving car unit first sued Uber in February, Uber has also refused to turn over the due diligence report it conducted ahead of the Otto acquisition, arguing that it can’t be disclosed because it involves confidential information between attorneys and clients.
As the case approaches trial, Waymo has argued that there is likely information inside the due diligence report that could answer a lot of the questions Anthony Levandowski — the engineer accused of stealing self-driving car trade secrets from Google and using them at Uber — has refused to answer as a result of him exercising his Fifth Amendment rights. Waymo is asking to see this due diligence report, which includes an interview with Levandowski. But Uber is currently arguing that this is protected by attorney-client privilege.
Update 12:15pm PT: Waymo has argued that the due diligence report, which Waymo has not seen, probably shows that Uber knew about the theft. If the due diligence report does indeed mention the theft of the 14,000 documents in question, that would mean Uber had a duty to return them, Waymo argues. But Uber argues that this is Waymo’s burden to prove, and that Waymo would need to prove that Uber was engaged in planning a criminal scheme.
On Wednesday, Judge William Alsup issued a notice that essentially said that the privilege logs Levandowski provided to the court were garbage and did not provide any useful information.
“To give just one example, entire pages of the spreadsheet in response to RFP No. 3 consisted of line items that identified ‘document type’ as ‘loose e-mail attachment’ and were otherwise blank,” Alsup wrote. “Similarly, dozens of pages of the spreadsheet in response to RFP No. 1 appeared dedicated to email attachments identified only by email account, time stamp, and otherwise wholly non-descriptive information. It would be wrong to suggest that any of those ‘privilege log’ entries could justify any claim of privilege.”
By tomorrow, Levandowski must provide further disclosures because Alsup did not find the privilege logs he previously submitted were sufficient.
Quick context: On April 12, Alsup ordered Levandowski to provide logs justifying his assertion of the Fifth Amendment, saying that it should not be a long document and that he provide Waymo “enough of the argument so that they can respond.”
Last week, Uber notified Levandowski that he either needs to deny that he downloaded and took any documents from Google, or to hand over the documents to Google. Otherwise, he would be at risk of getting fired from Uber. Uber has already removed Levandowski from working on any projects related to LiDAR technology.
Levandowski’s lawyers argued that the court’s order to Uber, as well as Uber’s threat to Levandowski, would violate his constitutional right to avoid self-incrimination.

291,"Lyft launches two premium ride hailing options, Lux and Lux SUV",https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/25/lyft-launches-two-premium-ride-hailing-options-lux-and-lux-suv/,2017/05/25,"
Lyft is getting into the higher-end ride hailing game with Lyft Lux and Lyft Lux SUV. These are black car offerings similar to the service that rival Uber originally launched with, and they’ll be available beginning in 20 markets with a gradual rollout starting now in five initial markets and continuing through mid-June.
Lux will roll out first in five U.S. cities where it makes the most sense to expect a demand for premium ride options, including Chicago, LA, NYC, SF and San Jose. On the driver side, the process of getting approved to drive Lux is obviously a bit more complex than the standard procedure for signing up to drive Lyft, and includes both a geographic requirement (you have to drive in a city where it’s currently offered), and a higher, more specific standard for vehicles.
Eligible cars must be at least a 2011 model year or above, have an actual black exterior paint job (in top condition), have leather or simulated leather seating, and be able to seat at least 6 riders comfortably if you want to drive the Lux SUV option, too. There’s also a specific list of car models and makes that you can use, which is available in full here.
Driving for Lux and Lux SUV will result in higher fares, of course, and will also cost more for users. It’s a good option for Lyft to make available if it wants to win over some of Uber’s more top-end customers, who are looking for a fancier ride during business travel or while hosting clients, for example.
Many looking at the future of ride hailing see the market continuing to evolve and serve a variety of different tiers – Tesla competitor Lucid Motors is even building a luxury EV sedan specifically tailored to ride-sharing and ride hailing usage. Differentiated service offerings like Lux will help Lyft better address this market maturation, should it continue to evolve along the lines of hotels and other aspects of the hospitality industry.

292,Uber and Lyft to return to Austin starting Monday,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/25/uber-and-lyft-to-return-to-austin-starting-monday/,2017/05/25,"
Uber and Lyft had paused their operations in Austin, TX back in 2016, because local regulators imposed rules that both argued were overly taxing to running their businesses. The rules included requiring fingerprint-based background checks for drivers, as well as barring pick-ups and drop-offs in lanes on certain roads within the city. Both Uber and Lyft will resume operations because Texas state regulators have passed a bill that overrules local regulations regarding ride-hailing services.
State Governor Greg Abbot will sign the new bill into law on Monday, the same day that both will resume service in the city, as The Texas Tribune reports. The bill, offiically HB 100, essentially undoes the rules put in place by Austin municipal regulators, standardizing requirements for ride-hailing operations across the state, and requiring that they have a permit from the state licensing body, which incurs an annual operations fee. It requires background checks performed at the local, state and national level, but doesn’t require that these include fingerprinting.
Uber confirmed it will return to active operating status in Austin on Monday, and provided the following statement to TechCrunch via spokesperson Travis Considine:
Austin is an incubator for technology and entrepreneurship, and we are excited to be back in the mix. Our local team is focused on making sure that Uber works for Austinites and helping our driver-partners earn. We know that we have a lot of work to do in the city, but we couldn’t be more excited for the road ahead.

293,Blippar’s machine learning tech can identify cars better than you can,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/25/blippars-machine-learning-tech-can-identify-cars-better-than-you-can/,2017/05/25,"
Do you think you know cars?
Well, Blippar’s new machine learning technology is ready to take you on, as the augmented reality/visual search company is today announcing automotive recognition tech.
In other words, Blippar’s AI can identify the make, model and year of any U.S. car made in 2000 or after, as long as the car is traveling slower than 15mph.
Blippar originally launched as an AR platform for brands and publishers. Using a little tag (a Blipp), brands could identify content like a label of a ketchup bottle or an ad in a magazine that users could scan with their phones to reveal extra augmented reality content.
The company has since pivoted to focus on visual search. There are plenty of things you see in the real world that are difficult to describe via text in a Google Search, such as flowers or items of clothing or an unfamiliar animal.
The company has spent the last year building out that visual search engine to identify generic objects — a table, a chair, a cup, and so on — and has laid the foundation to dive into specific verticals for visual search.
That begins with this automotive identification technology.

The technology will live within the Blippar app for folks who want to play around with it, offering information around make, model, year, average review rating, and a 360-degree view of the car, both inside and out. But the larger play comes in the form of an API, also launching today.
Secondhand sellers and insurance companies can build in this automotive identification technology into their own apps and pay on a performance basis to enhance their own businesses.
The tech has over 97.7 percent accuracy in recognizing vehicles, and Blippar says the technology is beyond what most humans can identify by sight.

We can expect to see Blippar roll out this type of technology, and accompanying API, across a number of sectors over the next year. In fact, CEO Rish Mitra mentioned that fashion is coming soon.
Blippar has raised a total of $99 million in funding from the likes of Qualcomm Ventures and Khazanah Nasional, according to Crunchbase.

294,Sherif Marakby rejoins Ford to lead self-driving after leaving Uber,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/25/sherif-marakby-rejoins-ford-to-lead-self-driving-after-leaving-uber/,2017/05/25,"
After leaving his role at Uber as VP of Global Vehicle Programs in April, Sherif Marakby is back at Ford to lead its autonomous vehicles and electrifications program. Marakby’s new VP role was announced as part of a general executive re-organization revealed on Thursday under new Ford CEO Jim Hackett.
Marakby joined Uber in April 2016, coming from Ford where he worked for 25 years, most recently as Director of Global Electrical/Electronic Systems Engineering. When Marakby’s departure from Uber became public in April, he didn’t specific future plans or a reason for his departure.
In his new role at Ford, Marakby will be a VP reporting to EVP and President of Global Markets Jim Farley. Other noteworthy shifts in leadership from a technology perspective include Ken Washington stepping into the CTO role, and continuing as VP of Research and Engineering, and former CTO Raj Nair (who just spoke at TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2017) moving to lead Ford’s North American operations.

295,Tesla Model 3 said to do 0-60 mph in 5.6 seconds,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/25/tesla-model-3-said-to-do-0-60-mph-in-5-6-seconds/,2017/05/25,"
The Tesla Model 3 is so close you could taste it (probably tastes like car) but we don’t yet know final specs on the vehicle. A new retail comparison chart surfaced at the Tesla Model 3 Owners Club forum (via InsideEVs) that offers some insight into what we can expect for specs, though it seems primarily designed to remind prospective buyers how great the Model S is by comparison.
In the diagram, we see that the Model 3 has a 0-60 mph acceleration time of 5.6 seconds, which is more than double the Model S best time of 2.3 seconds (which is achieved with the P100D variant operating in Ludicrous Mode). That’s in keeping with Tesla’s announced specs of “under 6 seconds” for the base model, which was made public in April, 2016.
The rest of the info from the chart was previously known, including a “215+” mile range from a single charge, and delivery time extending out beyond the one year mark, as well as pay-per-use charging at Tesla’s high-speed Supercharger stations. The trunk space detail also shows the value gap between the two cars – the smaller Model 3 has less than half the interior storage volume across both its trunk and its ‘frunk’ (front trunk).
While a 5.6 second 0-60 time isn’t going to break any records, it does put the Model 3 in comfortable company with the Audi A3 and near the BMW 330i, and it’ll definitely feel like a fast car, especially for sedan owners coming to electric from the first time from fuel injection vehicles.

296,"New Smart Fortwo EV: fewer dollars, more miles",https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/24/new-smart-fortwo-ev-fewer-dollars-more-miles/,2017/05/24,"
Mercedes-Benz announced the price of its new electric 2017 Smart Fortwo: $23,800 for the hard-top coupe and $28,000 for the cabrio with a sliding canvas roof. The new coupe’s price is $1,200 less than the outgoing model, but the cabrio’s price is exactly the same.
Besides the price, there are some practical improvements for the new Fortwo EV. There are a few more batteries on board — 96 lithium-ion cells versus the old 93 — though the battery capacity stays the same at 17.6 kWh. The on-board charger is more powerful, so the charging time drops in half, to three hours or less. The range gets a little bump from 68 miles to 70-80 miles, enough for daily urban commutes.
The 2017 Smart Fortwo EV will be available in the United States this summer, but these tiny two-seaters have had a tough time finding a niche in America, the land of SUVs and wide roads. Parent company Daimler decided to discontinue sales of gasoline-powered Smart cars in the States this year to focus on the EVs. It also decided to stop using Smart cars in its Car2Go point-to-point car-sharing service, with Mercedes-Benz cars replacing fleets in the U.S. beginning in 2017.
Smart doesn’t intend to compete with SUVs and pickup trucks, so who is the competition? The Tesla Model 3, the forthcoming small (but not micro) car, will have a 215-mile range for $35,000. The Chevy Bolt starts at $37,500 and has a range of more than 200 miles. The Volkswagen e-Golf gets 83 miles per charge, which is similar to the Fortwo’s range, but it starts at about $29,000 before tax incentives are applied. The new Hyundai Ioniq has more miles per charge, at 124, but its price starts at $29,500.
So for shorter-range emissions-free commuting and errand-running, the Smart Fortwo is an inexpensive option. But for carrying more than two people — or if you have a near-crippling case of range anxiety — you’ll need to pay more for one of the other EVs.

297,Innoviz debuts an aftermarket LiDAR product for self-driving car development,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/23/innoviz-debuts-an-aftermarket-lidar-product-for-self-driving-car-development/,2017/05/23,"
LiDAR is a key ingredient in the overall sensing package required to make autonomous cars a reality (though Tesla would disagree), but it’s also prohibitively expensive, especially for companies just starting out, and researchers not tied to companies with deep pockets. That’s why Innoviz has created a new aftermarket LiDAR unit offering good performance at more budget-friendly prices, set to go into mass production starting early next year.
The solution is called InnovizPro, and will be created in partnership with Jabil, an electronics design and projection company that acts as a supplier to global consumer electronics and industrial tech companies. It’ll be a solid-sate LiDAR device, like the InnovizOne unit it revealed earlier this year targeting deployment in actual production vehicles designed for consumer use.
InnovizPro will offer high-definition 3D environment scanning, and is intended to help automakers and tier 1 suppliers develop autonomous tech that can later be used with production-ready equipment like the InnovizOne, which is on track for a Q1 2019 sample availability date.
Basically, Innoviz decided to take the current prototype it’s using in development of the InnovizOne and make it available to outside organizations and companies ahead of time, in a form that, while not production-ready, will still be far more affordable and performant than other existing solutions. Innoviz CEO and co-founder noted in a press release that “companies are currently spending tens of thousands of dollars on under-performing LiDAR solutions” for testing, which is likely a dig at Velodyne, whose LiDAR units adorn Uber test vehicles and have a per-unit cost of around $70,000.
No word on specific pricing of Innoviz’s solution, but given the bombast, you can expect it to be less than $70K. Plus, solid state means fewer moving parts, which should hopefully translate to fewer maintenance concerns and longer usable life. All good things when you’re engaged in autonomous vehicle development and testing.

298,"Auto1 Group, a young used-car marketplace serving Europe, is now worth $2.8 billion",https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/22/auto1-group-a-young-used-car-marketplace-serving-europe-is-now-worth-2-8-billion/,2017/05/22,"
Auto1 Group, a nearly five-year-old, Berlin-based used-car marketplace, just announced a huge round — €360 million ($404 million) in debt and equity financing that includes €75 million ($84.2 million) from Princeville Global, itself a Hong Kong-based investment firm with a second office in San Francisco.
Why the excitement over Auto1? Momentum, seemingly.
The company, which values and buys used cars from individuals, dealerships, and manufacturers, then sells them for a profit to other dealerships, says it facilitated 330,000 vehicle transactions on its platform last year. It also says it reached revenue of €1.5 billion. Indeed, in a press statement released late last week, cofounder and co-CEO Christian Bertermann said the company will use its new funding to capture what it hopes will soon be 10 percent of Europe’s used sales car market.
It has plenty of competition, of course. Among its rivals are the giant dealer groups Emil Frey and AVAG Holding, which are headquartered in Switzerland and Germany, respectively.
Plenty of used car marketplaces have also lost their thrust at some point, including Beepi, a direct-to-consumer platform founded in 2013 that was sold for parts earlier this year after raising $150 million from investors.
In fairness, Beepi was mismanaged, according to TechCrunch sources, including by paying “grossly high salaries.” Beepi, along with a spate of other used-car startups that includes Vroom, Shift, and Carvana, also featured a rather different business model than Auto1. Instead of selling cars directly to consumers via the Internet, Auto1 isn’t looking to skip the dealership; it’s betting consumers want to literally kick the tires.
Auto1 also uses its own cash to buy the cars and store them until they’re sold to dealers (thus the big debt component in its fundraise). According to a 2015 Bloomberg story about the company, this speeds up the process for sellers from an average of 90 days in Europe to closer to 10 days.
Auto1 was cofounded by Bertermann — a former VP of product at Groupon — soon after he struggled to sell off two old cars that belonged to his grandmother. His cofounder is Hakan Koc, who was previously the chief product officer at the online home furnishings company Home24. They met while working in the same building.
The company’s newest round of funding, which officially closed a bit earlier this year, also includes Baillie Gifford & Co. and Target Global, and it values the company at $2.8 billion.
Some points of comparison: 24-year-old, CarMax, which is among the largest used-car companies in the U.S., is valued at roughly $12 billion by public market shareholders, and 21-year-old AutoNation, which sells both new and pre-owned vehicles in the U.S., enjoys a public market cap of $4 billion. Europe’s largest used-car companies remain privately held.
Auto1’s earlier backers include DST Global, Piton Capital, DN Capital, and Cherry Ventures.

Ford Motors will replace CEO Mark Fields with the head of its subsidiary responsible for developing self-driving cars, reports the New York Times.
Ford is expected to announce the appointment of Jim Hackett, the chairman of Ford Smart Mobility, as its new CEO on Monday. Founded last year, Ford Smart Mobility develops technology for connected and autonomous vehicles.
During Ford’s annual shareholder meeting earlier this month, Fields was blamed for the 40 percent drop in Ford’s stock price since he became CEO. Despite its investments in self-driving cars, which also include $1 billion poured into a joint venture with Argo AI, Ford has struggled to balance the cost of creating new technology with declining auto sales.
Ford not only has to compete with tech companies like Google, Waymo, and Tesla (whose market cap surpassed Ford’s for the first time last month), but fellow automaker General Motors, which may deploy what would be the largest fleet of self-driving cars in the world, according to documents uncovered by IEEE Spectrum.
We’ve contacted Ford for comment.

300,Parking Kitty makes parking in Portland adorable,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/19/parking-kitty-makes-parking-in-portland-adorable/,2017/05/19,"
Portland, Oregon, continued to keep it weird (and cute) this week when it rolled out Parking Kitty, a new app that lets you pay for metered parking. The app is based on Passport, one of the largest parking payment vendors in the United States. “We didn’t make a lot of changes,” said Malisa McCreedy, the parking division manager at the Portland Bureau of Transportation. “But we did put our local face on it.”
And that face is adorable. Parking Kitty has a cat-faced icon and a feline theme. When you pay, it purrs. When your meter is about to expire, it meows. “We wanted something that was not too automotive-tied and was a more universal app,” McCreedy said. “What could we do that was fun and memorable?”
The challenge, McCreedy said, wasn’t in the branding. PDOT had to test the app to make sure it worked with other systems and services that were already in place and with vendors. And with a new way to pay, there had to be a new way to enforce parking regulations. All the data from Parking Kitty is stored in the same place as data from the physical pay stations at the curb. Parking patrols can’t just look at the meter or the receipt in the window when someone has paid with Parking Kitty; they’ll have to check in with the database.
The app works in 27 of the city’s parking zones, as well as in Washington Park and parking garages at Portland State University. PSU and Washington Park already had separate contracts with Passport, but McReedy said that no one wanted users to have three apps to accomplish the same thing. So the university, the park, and the city worked together to create Parking Kitty.
Being an automotive journalist and owner of three cats, I tried the app the day it was released. It worked seamlessly, and I didn’t mind paying a 10-cent transaction fee for the convenience of being able to re-up my meter when my meeting a few blocks away ran long. But who am I kidding — I’m paying that 10 cents for the meowing reminder. Cute!

The upgrade will be available for around 800,000 vehicles in total, giving a huge number of Ford car owners the chance to get big infotainment improvements without having to buy a newer model car.
The OTA update option is also a big step for Ford – it’s the company’s first for software, and it’s one of the major reasons that Ford recently hired around 400 new mobile smartphone engineers, the company tells me.
For CarPlay, users will still also need to upgrade their vehicle’s USB hub to make this work (which will also incur a dealer visit and a cost), but for those on Android, all that’s required is a simple software installation. The USB install method is also faster, but the Wi-Fi update option is the start of the company’s efforts to really increase its OTA update program, which will be used for security improvements as well as infotainment bumps.
Even with a dealer visit and hardware upgrade for CarPlay, this sounds like a worthwhile thing for 2016 vehicle owners to do. CarPlay and Android Auto are huge upgrades vs. most in-car software, offering navigation and entertainment options that follow you from your phone to your car.
Retroactively offering this kind of thing to car owners is a definite change in tone for car makers, since they typically use these kinds of things as incentives to get people interested in vehicle model updates. But as data becomes increasingly important to automakers as a business, it makes sense to encourage greater in-car use of devices.

302,In the car with Android in the Car,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/18/in-the-car-with-android-in-the-car/,2017/05/18," 



One of the areas that Google talked up regarding Android beyond phones at I/O this year was in vehicles, and Android in the Car was the main way it’s expanding its in-car presence. The expansion of its Android Auto software offers deeper integration with vehicle infotainment and climate control systems, and putting Assistant front and center for more voice control inside the car and out.
The system offers Google Maps navigation, of course, as demoed in a Volvo V90 outfitted with Android in the Car specifically for demonstration purposes. But it also offers easy access to your cabin AC and heat, and you can ask the Volvo to simply cool things down or heat them up to turn the air on or off. The Android-based OS also can control windows, the sunroof and more.
You can also use Assistant-compatible smart home devices from the comfort of your car’s cockpit via voice commands. Our guide for the experience, Google Senior Product Manager Haris Ramic, showed us how this works using Hue light bulbs and a Nest learning thermostat, mounted for demo purposes on a wood backdrop meant to simulate your house.

Basically, Android in the Car means that you can take a lot of your mobile experience with you, and now that Assistant is getting improved cross-device features and Google’s really pushing it with developers, this should be very good news for consumers.
We still have to wait a while for this to arrive in cars you can actually buy: Volvo says that it’ll be debuting on new cars sometime within two years, but it isn’t getting more specific than that.

303,Mercedes home storage batteries coming to the US,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/18/mercedes-home-storage-batteries-coming-to-the-us/,2017/05/18,"
Mercedes-Benz Energy announced that it’s teamed up with Vivint Solar to provide batteries for storing energy at home in the United States, starting in California this spring.
Last year, Mercedes started a program in Germany that works almost exactly the same way. Mercedes uses the automotive-grade batteries it’s developed for electric vehicles, which can withstand a lot of charging and discharging cycles. The company partnered with utilities and solar companies in Germany to store surplus energy for later use in the home.
This is exactly the same kind of system. When new customers hire Vivint Solar to install an array of solar cells on their roof, they can choose to add up to eight 2.5 kWh Mercedes batteries. The modular battery systems allows the homeowner to customize energy storage depending on how much energy is being captured and used.
The batteries work as a backup if the grid goes down, but they also allow users to make the most of their solar energy. The system can store the energy created during the day for use later, when the sun goes down and energy usage rates often climb.
The main competitor for Mercedes-Benz Energy and Vivint is Tesla, which makes Powerwall storage batteries and now the solar cells. Tesla would like you to charge your Tesla car with energy from Tesla solar cells that’s been stored in a Tesla Powerwall, but you as a consumer are not required to buy into a particular ecosystem. Mercedes and Vivint are only the latest option of what will likely be many more in the future.

304,Lucid Motors and Local Motors on the wildly different paths each is taking to change the way we look at vehicles,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/16/lucid-motors-and-local-motors-on-the-wildly-different-paths-each-is-taking-to-change-the-way-we-look-at-vehicles/,2017/05/16,"Peter Rawlinson (Lucid Motors) and Jay Rogers (Local Motors) at TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2017

Lucid Motors and Local Motors. Two companies, both looking to shake up how the world thinks about vehicles and mobility — but each one is trying to take an entirely different route to get there.
Lucid wants to build a luxury electric sedan (driverless, eventually) by tapping a team of 300 hand-picked experts in the field; Local is building driverless shuttles via the “most distributed team you can imagine,” with a community of more than 30,000 individuals contributing their brainpower to everything from autonomous driving systems to drivetrain design.
What are the strengths and weaknesses of each approach? And is now the right time for this?
At TechCrunch Disrupt NY, Darrell Etherington sat down with Lucid Motors CTO Peter Rawlinson and Local Motors CEO Jay Rogers to talk about how and why it’ll all come together.
How, for example, does Local keep its widespread community focused on the common goal?
“Believing in the power of the crowd is something you either do or you don’t. If you believe in it, you ride the lightning, ” says Rogers. “You’ll always get people who contribute junk; then you have people who come in and simply contribute genius. Managing it is about maintaining a workforce of team members who are focused on the community and setting a standard for each area — whether it’s autonomy, or drives, or electrification, or whether it is crash energy, or any of the parts of a vehicle, we focus our community members down into those areas and start from there.”
But at Lucid, says Rawlinson: “We… have a very different approach. I think it’s a wonderful thing, but we believe in everyone under the same roof with a clarity and focus and vision on a transformative product”
Meanwhile, Lucid confirmed that they’re still targeting 2019 for their first commercial product, while Local notes that they’ll deliver “25 vehicles to Denmark that are level four autonomous this year” (although, as shuttles, ones that won’t go quite as fast as other things on the road).
The entire interview is worth watching — particularly if electric vehicles and self-driving cars are your thing.

305,Why Uber may see a fresh flood of departures in the not-too-distant future,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/16/why-uber-may-see-a-fresh-flood-of-departures-in-the-not-too-distant-future/,2017/05/16,"
Last year, we told you about the employees at Uber who were seemingly handcuffed to the company, noting that those whose shares were vested can’t afford to quit.
Startup employees typically have to exercise their options within 90 days of leaving a company or else lose them, and given Uber’s stratospheric valuation, that cost had simply grown too daunting.
By February of this year, Uber had struck on one way to give restless employees a way to cash out, according to Bloomberg. Those who work at the company for at least four years can sell as much as 10 percent of their shares, though to ensure they don’t rush for the exits, they are paid out over many months and have to stay at Uber during that period.
Now, according to a new report in The Information, longtime employees wanting to move on with their lives have another path, thanks to a change in how Uber handles stock options. Specifically, says The Information’s sources, Uber is dropping the requirement that employees who quit must exercise their options within 90 days or lose them; instead, the employees will have as much as several years to exercise the options after they’ve left the company.
It’s a major turnaround, and it will impact roughly 10 percent of Uber’s roughly 12,000 employees who’ve been with the company for least three years, says the report. (As it notes, in 2014, the company began to issue restricted stock units, or RSUs, instead of traditional stock options.)
Given the seemingly endless turmoil surrounding the company, it’s probably fair to assume that many of those people will, in fact, hightail it despite the morale-boosting gesture on Uber’s part. While they may represent a comparatively small percentage of Uber’s overall employee base, presumably these are fairly key employees, too, given their institutional knowledge of Uber.
They may have company on their way out. In separate but related news, Recode is reporting this morning that Uber’s internal investigation into a former engineer’s claims of sexual harassment and general workplace hostility will conclude by the end of the month, and that two key executives who’ve come under scrutiny as part of that investigation — board director Ryan Graves and CTO Thuan Pham — may be fired as a result.
Several other C-level executives have also parted ways with the company during its very troubled 2017. Uber’s head of public policy and communications, Rachel Whestone, quietly left in April. Uber president Jeff Jones quit one month earlier, citing differences over “beliefs and approach to leadership.” Uber’s SVP of engineering, Amit Singhal, was asked to leave even earlier in the year after it was learned he didn’t disclose that he’d left his previous employer, Google, over disputed sexual harassment allegations. Ed Baker, who served as Uber’s VP of product and growth for three years beginning in 2013, also left in March of this year.

306,"BMW, Intel and Mobileye bring Delphi in on their self-driving platform",https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/16/bmw-intel-and-mobileye-bring-delphi-in-on-their-self-driving-platform/,2017/05/16,"
BMW, Intel and Mobileye have a new partner in their previously announced initiative to co-develop an autonomous driving platform. Delphi is now a member of the group effort, which was announced first in July 2016, prior to Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye earlier this year.
Delphi will be providing key compute components for the system, and have already supplied a prototype of the platform they’ll eventually supply to the system to the collaborative team. They’ll work directly with Intel and Mobileye on sensor fusion and highly automated driving software.
Intel and Delphi were previously partnered up on autonomous tech, and the two brought their demonstration driverless vehicle to CES this year, where we got the chance to take a ride. The Audi, equipped with Delphi’s systems and sensors from partners, including Mobileye, handled busy Las Vegas streets with seeming ease. Same goes for a more recent drive at Intel’s new Autonomous Driving Garage in Silicon Valley, where the same Delphi car was providing test rides with updated versions of its software. BMW also recently started fielding its latest highly automated test vehicles, one of which made its U.S. debut at the same Intel Garage opening event.



The BMW, Intel and Mobileye group has set 2021 as their target date for bringing an automated driving platform into production. Their aim is to build a platform that can be used not only for BMW vehicles, but also by other automakers and also automotive systems developers.
Delphi will be doing a lot with integration of the technologies provided by the other partners in the mix, as well as potentially supplying some additional hardware, the companies say, including sensors. The longtime auto industry supplier, which spun out from GM in 1999, announced earlier this month that it would be spinning out its own powertrain division into a separate company from the unit focused on autonomy and EVs.

307,"To stop hackers from invading self-driving cars, Karamba Security raises $12 million",https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/16/to-stop-hackers-from-invading-self-driving-cars-karamba-security-raises-12-million/,2017/05/16,"
By 2020, an estimated 75 percent of cars will be internet-connected worldwide, according to estimates from the FBI, Department of Transportation and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That connectivity will allow drivers to tap into life-saving safety features and make self-driving cars a reality. But it also makes vehicles vulnerable to malicious hackers.
There hasn’t been a malevolent hack against connected cars en masse yet. And one Israeli startup called Karamba Security wants to keep it that way. Karamba has raised a $12 million Series B round of funding led by the company’s existing investors, Fontinalis Partners, which is Bill Ford’s mobility-focused fund, as well as YL Ventures, a firm that backs Israeli startups aiming to grow their business in the U.S. Karamba also added new investors in their Series B round, including Paladin Capital Group, Liberty Mutual Strategic Ventures, Presidio Ventures and Asgent.
Paladin’s Managing Director Chris Inglis, who previously served as the deputy director and COO of the National Security Agency, said: “There are enormously positive transformational changes tech is bringing about. Think about the things autonomous cars will do for us! But we have to build security in from the beginning, not as an applique afterwards.”
He lauded Karamba’s approach to securing vehicles, as well as the fact that the company treats connected cars differently than general purpose computing devices, which are designed to run someone else’s code. Predecessors to Karamba focused more on intrusion detection systems for vehicle security that mimicked the systems used for PCs.

Karamba’s software is built-in to a car, and can prevent hacks on an embedded system, explained the company’s co-founder and chairman David Barzilai. Specifically, it is installed in a vehicle’s ECUs, which are tiny computers that control various functions inside a car, from the brakes to the navigation and on-board entertainment systems. Karamba’s software locks down the ECU’s factory settings, preventing the execution of any programs that would deviate from those settings.
Barzilai said the company has raised three rounds of funding within about one year, bringing its total capital raised to $17 million to date. Karamba has begun working with 16 new customers in the past 15 months in the cost-sensitive industry of automotive manufacturing. The company will use some of its funding to set up offices in Michigan, near major U.S. automakers, but most of it will go to hiring, continued research and development and performance testing of vehicles.
Barzilai said Karamba’s goal is to keep malevolent hacks from ever affecting cars. Already, security researchers have demonstrated myriad ways to exploit apps and systems in vehicles to mess with drivers and their car’s behavior.
Fiat Chrysler had to issue a Jeep Cherokee recall after Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek demonstrated their cars’ vulnerabilities. And Tesla had to issue major security upgrades after Tencent security researchers demonstrated a way to exploit the Wi-Fi in a Tesla S to remotely activate the car’s brakes while the car was still in motion. But a mass attack, Barzilai hopes, does not have to be an eventuality.

308,Savari works to bring 5G to connected cars,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/15/savari-works-to-bring-5g-to-connected-cars/,2017/05/15,"
In these early days of smart cities and connected cars, Savari has emerged as a V2X (that’s vehicle-to-everything) innovator. Now it’s joined the 5G Automotive Association to bring cellular communications to connected cars.
This technology doesn’t merely provide faster cell service on the morning commute. Cellular-V2X (C-V2X) is a communications system for connected cars to share data with each other and with the surrounding infrastructure — no humans required. With 5G, cars can send and receive messages 10 times per second. The data can be analyzed quickly enough to provide as much as 3 seconds’ advance warning before an accident might happen, according to Savari.
Using 5G communications means that the collected data also can be uploaded to the cloud and distributed via the cellular network to other cars using 5G. This will give other drivers more information even earlier. Rather than relying on the data to avoid an imminent crash, the network can tell traffic to avoid that stretch of road altogether until the accident is cleared.
The 5G Automotive Association already has a few dozen members, including OEMs like Audi, Ford and Daimler, automotive suppliers like Bosch, Denso and Continental, and cellular industry companies like Verizon, Samsung and LG. Savari says its role in the group will be to help create standards that work across the industry as semi-autonomous cars and fully autonomous cars are tested and eventually sold.
You may be wondering about dedicated short-range communications, or DSRC, technology, which is already being tested in V2X communications for vehicles and infrastructure. It sends simple radio signals based on Wi-Fi technology. While cellular carriers are pushing the National Transportation Highway Safety Administration (NHTSA) to adopt 5G over DSRC for V2X programs going forward, other companies, like Qualcomm, say they’re ready to roll with either communications technology.
Right now, neither technology is very widely deployed. The main advantage of C-V2X is that it’s nearly twice as fast as DSRC. When a self-driving car is gathering data to prevent crashes, that speed is going to be crucial. The main advantage of DSRC is that it’s been developed and tested for more than a decade; its stability and familiarity is likely to appeal to NHTSA, which will issue a mandate on V2X communications.

309,Ford CTO Raj Nair on the future: Ford will look very different in 10 years,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/15/ford-cto-raj-nair-on-the-future-ford-will-look-very-different-in-ten-years/,2017/05/15,"Raj Nair (Ford) at TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2017

Today at TechCrunch Disrupt NY, our own Darrell Etherington sat down with Ford Motor Company CTO (and Ford employee since 1987!) Raj Nair to chat about the future and how a company like Ford shifts with an evolving industry — particularly as the car industry adopts the idea of cars that drive themselves.
While the overall panel was about autonomous vehicles, they started off with a quick mention of the GT — Ford’s ridiculous (both in its ridiculous performance and in the ridiculously low number of them being made), $450,000 supercar. We spent an afternoon checking out the GT a few weeks back.
“Yeah.. that car is a little bit my baby,” said Nair. “But it’s kind of the opposite of a driverless vehicle.”
Nair elaborated on this a bit later when Darrell asked if we’d see a 100th anniversary GT (as this new GT is a 50th anniversary celebration of the original) — effectively, whether or not Ford would still be making human-driven vehicles in 50 years:
Technology is progressing fast. We’re 114 years old, and there are still aspects of the start of the automotive industry and what it meant for personal mobility. Horses don’t serve the role that they used to, but there’s still a lot of horse races that are a big deal, and people still enjoy riding horses. I hope it doesn’t go that far, but it’s certainly a possibility. I think there will always be an aspect of controlling a piece of machinery, of two or three thousand pounds of machinery being controlled by very minute movements of your hand… Taking yourself to the limit, taking the machine to the limit; there’s something in our brain wired to enjoy that, so hopefully that’s always a part of it.
While there will probably always be those who’ll want to drive themselves (if eventually only for sport), the industry trend toward figuring out autonomous vehicles seems clear. But this introduces a whole new challenge for the industry: if a vehicle can drive itself… you don’t necessarily need to own one, as you can just summon a car when you need it. Nair suggests they’re well aware of this, but it’s something on the horizon:
The pace at which the technology is advancing is faster than it’s ever been. It’s becoming more readily apparent to the broader public and the industry, and new entrants out in Silicon valley, and there’s a lot more players coming into it. I think on the usership side — the popularity of ride hailing, the ride sharing model, is increasing — yet, the aspect of personal ownership is still really, really high. We’re at a record industry of sales right now. I think we’ll see a distribution change over time, but that part of it’ll be gradual. Yet this industry operates on pretty long cycles, so we need to be planning for that right now.
But with just about every automotive maker cracking away at this challenge, how might Ford be the one to get it done? At least in part, by not insisting that they do it all themselves.
“We’re not intent on doing it ourselves,” says Raj, mentioning their acquisitions (like SAIPS, the machine learning company Ford purchased in 2016), licensing and investments — like Argo AI, a team Ford committed to investing $1 billion dollars into over five years. “Probably the most sought-after talent in the autonomous space are the roboticists, the software experts and the machine learning experts… We have a very strong team internally, but to be honest, they were being very heavily recruited.”
Ford has already been experimenting with shared vehicles with Chariot, the ride-sharing service it acquired last year. If shared vehicles/routes becomes a sizeable part of Ford’s business, who owns that shared (and, presumably, eventually autonomous) fleet? Ford? Private entities? Municipalities? (As Darrell noted onstage, TechCrunch had previously heard that Ford was talking with municipalities about owning ridesharing fleets as they might own public transit.)
We’re experimenting with a couple different forms of that. Part of that is the Chariot experiment which we’re doing, where we’re owning fleets of transits, running shuttles and working with municipalities on some aspects of dynamic shuttles and dynamic routing, but also fixed routes at a smaller scale. And other city-as-customer pilots… I think we’re open to ownership of that fleet. We’re open to different models, and different discussions as to where ownership of that fleet would reside… We’re interested in managing those vehicles as a service, we’re interested in manufacturing those vehicles and we’d also be interested in the profit opportunity for transportation services.
So if Ford deeply embraces technology at deeper and deeper levels moving forward, will it keep its “Ford Motor” name or change it to something like “Ford Technology”?
I think we’re going to be called Ford Motor Company for a while. The company is attached to it — the family is attached to it… but I think Ford Motor Company will look very different 10 years from now. It’ll be known not just as an automotive company, but an automotive and mobility company.

310,Judge ruling means Uber can continue self-driving work but Levandowski barred from LiDAR,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/15/judge-rules-uber-can-continue-self-driving-work-but-levandowski-barred-from-lidar/,2017/05/15,"
A judge has ruled in the matter of a preliminary injunction related to Uber’s use of autonomous tech, finding that Google employee and Otto founder Anthony Levandowski can no longer work on any projects that involve LiDAR technology. Uber, however, can continue its autonomous driving development work in general, and had already voluntarily removed Levandowski from his role at the head of the Uber Advanced Technologies Group (ATG) and taken him off all LiDAR-related projects, but the judge’s legal ruling is obviously a stronger measure than just a voluntary distancing.
Uber faced a preliminary injunction ordered by Judge William Alsup in the ongoing legal saga between the two companies. Waymo alleges that Uber exec and Otto co-founder Anthony Levandowski downloaded tens of thousands of confidential documents related to LiDAR design from Waymo before quitting the company, and used those documents to build self-driving tech at Otto and Uber.
As mentioned, in a last-ditch (and mostly successful) effort to prevent the injunction, Uber announced that Levandowski had been removed as the lead of its autonomous vehicle unit and would no longer supervise or participate in the development of LiDAR. Levandowski will still have a role at Uber, however.
Judge Alsup ruled that information gleaned from Waymo’s work “leaked into” Uber’s own LiDAR tech development, regardless of whether any documents were actually found on Uber computers and devices.
Uber has argued that Levandowski had little to do with LiDAR development at Uber and that its designs were independently developed without any reliance on Waymo’s technology. Uber has said its current LiDAR system, codenamed Fuji, is unique because it uses a multi-lens design (as opposed to Waymo’s Grizzly Bear 3, or GrB3, which uses a single lens). Waymo has instead highlighted similarities between its circuit boards and Uber’s.
Levandowski has consistently invoked his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination throughout the case and Waymo has filed an arbitration proceeding against him, alleging he used confidential salary data to poach Waymo employees and bring them to Uber. Judge Alsup denied Uber’s request to confine Waymo’s trade secret complaints to arbitration as well, and referred the case to the U.S. Attorney for a possible criminal investigation.
Since Waymo requested the preliminary injunction on March 10, Judge Alsup issued repeated warnings that Uber was likely on track to find itself on the receiving end of an injunction. Waymo sought to bar Uber’s use of the LiDAR technology it created entirely — technology it claims Levandowski used to help jumpstart Uber’s stagnant autonomous driving program.
The ruling also states that Waymo can “inspect any and all aspects of defendants’ ongoing work involving LiDAR – including, without limitation, schematics, work orders, source code, notes and emails – whether or not said work resulted in any prototype or device” which sounds like pretty broad license.
The self-driving program at Uber began following its hiring of a significant percentage of Carnegie Mellon University’s autonomous vehicle research team in 2015, but reports suggest that the acquisition of Otto last August helped kickstart the company’s progress considerably. Levandowski, Otto’s CEO, was put in charge of Uber’s overall self-driving effort following the acquisition.
Uber provided the following statement to TechCrunch via a spokesperson:
We are pleased with the court’s ruling that Uber can continue building and utilizing all of its self-driving technology, including our innovation around LiDAR. We look forward to moving toward trial and continuing to demonstrate that our technology has been built independently from the ground up.
Waymo offered the following via its spokesperson:
Competition should be fueled by innovation in the labs and on the roads, not through unlawful actions. We welcome the order to prohibit Uber’s use of stolen documents containing trade secrets developed by Waymo through years of research, and to formally bar Mr Levandowski from working on the technology. The court has also granted Waymo expedited discovery and we will use this to further protect our work and hold Uber fully responsible for its misconduct.

311,Volvo and Audi turn to Android for next-gen connected cars,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/15/volvo-and-audi-turn-to-android-for-next-gen-connected-cars/,2017/05/15,"
Volvo and Audi are looking to do more with Android in its forthcoming connected vehicles, the companies announced on Monday ahead of this week’s Google I/O developer conference. The companies will be showing off the fruits of this deeper integration at the event in San Jose, which goes beyond entertainment and navigation to help drivers and passengers control AC, windows, sunroof and more via Android.
The integration of Android throughout more of the infotainment experience in cars is a win for Google, which is moving out ahead of competitors like Apple in terms of gaining more real estate in automobiles. This will become increasingly important as vehicles become sites for more mobile activity and additional connected activities, which will lead to more generation of data that can be useful to Google as an advertising platform, as well as for other aspects of its business including media delivery.
For Volvo and Audi, the advantage is more about meeting customers where they are – the dominant interface of any average person’s life is still going to be their smartphone for the foreseeable future. Plus, as infotainment tech has evolved, carmakers have been struggling to keep up in terms of providing intuitive ways for people to operate their vehicles.
Audi is showing off its Q8 sport concept at I/O to demonstrate how this will work on the user end, but basically Google Assistant will take a primary place as a voice controlled central companion. Navigation will still default to Audi’s HERE services, which makes sense given that Audi owner Volkswagen Group is a co-owner of the service following its divestment from Nokia. But users can switch the default to Google Maps, which is a significant sign that automakers are realizing the better strategy is to partner when it comes to in-car infotainment and cockpit control UX.
Google is also going to be able to provide more flexibility and immediacy when it comes to pushing out updates, Volvo notes, and better personalization across a driver’s digital life. Provided this results in more use of in-car connected services, this should benefit all parties involved thanks to the resulting wealth of data produced.

312,GM expands Maven car sharing to NYC,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/15/gm-expands-maven-car-sharing-to-nyc/,2017/05/15,"
GM’s car sharing service Maven is expanding to the largest city in the U.S., the company announced Monday. The expansion is one of many for the company, which originally began operating only in January 2016, and is now available in 17 different markets across North America. Maven now includes three service offerings, including City, which is on-demand short-term rental; Home, which offers shared fleets at residential buildings for resident use; and Gig, which is a short-term rental option for on-demand economy drivers.
Maven’s New York fleet will include over 80 vehicles at launch, all of which include included 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspots, CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as OnStar support. They also include insurance in the cost of the rental, which can be reserved on either an hourly or daily basis.
While never formally announced, Maven Home is actually a new arm of GM’s Maven mobility services umbrella. It’s new to Maven, but it actually harkens back to one of GM’s first forays into ownership alternatives – Let’s Drive NYC, which debuted in October 2015, and which provided service focused on residential buildings. Maven Home is similar, offering dedicated cars just for use of a building’s residents, with fuel and insurance bundled into the hourly rental rates.
The New York growth is a key market for Maven, and could likely be one of its strongest, given the urban density and resident comfort with ownership alternatives.

313,Lyft and Waymo to team up on self-driving cars amid Uber controversy,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/14/lyft-and-waymo-to-team-up-on-self-driving-cars/,2017/05/14,"
Lyft and Waymo are working together on self-driving car technology, with a new deal first reported by the New York Times on Sunday. The deal has been confirmed by both parties, and will see Google’s former self-driving car unit work together with the ride-hailing company on efforts to introduce self-driving to the general population via fleet services.
Waymo just launched a self-driving technology public pilot in Arizona, where its Chrysler Pacifica minivans equipped with in-house developed self-driving tech will be picking up families on-demand, with applications open to anyone working in the city. Waymo’s service is limited to begin with, but bringing a partner like Lyft into the mix will likely help it build out the side of the business that requires demand modeling, efficient routing and more.
It’s an interesting partnership because it’s another piece of the puzzle in addition to Waymo’s existing tie-ups with automakers, including Chrysler, and a pending an agreement with Honda. Waymo is positioning itself as the technology partner on the autonomy side, an essential service provider but not necessarily a player interested in owning the whole stack. Lyft offers another piece of the puzzle, which could ultimately benefit Waymo’s existing automaker partners, and help it attract more, too.
Uber is also making similar partnerships, with an open program for OEs, the first of which is Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler. Lyft is different, however, in that it has not expressed any interest in making its own self-driving tech in-house, but has instead formed a previously announced partnership with GM, which is likely to result in a pilot of autonomous tech fleet deployment with GM-owned Cruise.
This is the latest move that indicates Waymo might be closer to commercializing its technology than many may have thought. The Alphabet-owned company is arguably the player in the space with the most experience, with nearly a decade of development work and actual driving experience with autonomous car tech.

314,Lucid’s unique approach to cars is about more than just electric drivetrains,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/14/lucids-unique-approach-to-cars-is-about-more-than-just-electric-drivetrains/,2017/05/14," 



Lucid Motors is a startup focused electric cars, and the company revealed the design of its first car, the Lucid Air, at the very end of last year. The luxury sedan looks like a natural competitor to Tesla’s Model S, but the company has a view of the direction of the industry that makes its car unique from the rest of the field in more ways than one.
Crucially, Lucid is betting that our usage of cars is going to change dramatically in the next few years, and as a result, so will the attributes valued in a vehicle like the Lucid Air. The Air is slated to go on sale in 2019, but its design focus anticipates a horizon even a few years beyond that, when the company’s founders and top talent anticipate a mature, robust multi-tier car sharing economy in place, as well as autonomous services that are technologically advanced enough to make passenger accoutrements just as, if not more important than driver and cockpit comforts.
Lucid Motors’ VP of Design Derek Jenkins explained how the company sees car sharing eventually becoming a multi-tier market with luxury options alongside budget and mid-tier offerings, essentially operating like the hotel industry does today. That guided the design of the car from the very start, with Lucid aiming to create the first luxury car that was actually made from the ground-up with car-sharing in mind. It’s why when you sit in the backseat (the top trim back seat, at least), you feel like a first class passenger. But since it’s a car designed to span both the age of the driver and the age of driverless vehicles, with eventual plans to upgrade its software to offer full autonomy, the cockpit also feels comparable to luxury driver-focused vehicles. That includes the power that’s obvious when our test driver gunned the accelerator, and the interior interfaces for use while driving.
James Felkins, senior user experience designer, took us through the thinking behind the wraparound dash displays and primary center console infotainment system. All of this is also designed to make driving feel like a full-service experience, with information and controls provided when and where you need them. Lucid also plans to integrated virtual assistant services, but it’s going to lean on those that users will be carrying with them already, including things like Siri and Alexa, to provide the smarts – in a package ideally suited for use while driving with a minimum of distraction.

Lucid seems perhaps most proud of how much car they’ve been able to fit in such a small package – the exterior dimensions of the Air are less than those of a Model S, but it boasts far more usable interior volume, because, according to the company, it’s been designed with that in mind from the beginning. The target audience are city dwellers, mostly, and the idea was to create a car that would accommodate both the realities of less available space, while also offering upper-end users the comfort they seek.
Lucid’s Air is still quite a ways away from production, but it says the design is near final. The car seems to have feet both in the current world of the driver, and the world of our seemingly inevitable autonomous future. Lucid says it can do both without compromising either category, but a lot will depend on where the auto and transportation market is at in 2019 in terms of ho well it succeeds with its approach.

315,Val.ai lets self-driving cars bid for parking spots,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/14/self-parking-vehicle/,2017/05/14,"
Where will self-driving cars go once they drop you off? In big cities, parking can be expensive and take forever to find. But TechCrunch Disrupt NY hackathon team Val.ai built a way for autonomous vehicles to participate in auctions for nearby parking spaces.
When a self-driving car needs to park itself, it can submit real-time bids for local spots occupied by others. If a currently parked car knows it needs to pick someone up soon, and it will earn more from selling the parking spot now than the gas it might burn driving around until its pick-up time, it can accept a bid. The winning bidder vehicle gets directions to the spot, and the one parked there vacates when it arrives.



While there aren’t so many self-driving cars on the road that we need this just yet, technology like Val.ai could eventually reduce congestion and pollution by more efficiently routing cars to spaces. The project was built using Clarifai, ThingSpace and MapQuest.
But there’s one big problem with Val.ai. The pitch made it sound like the cars would be auctioning off public parking spots. Squatting in these spots until another car pays enough could be seen as abusing public resources for private gain. When a few startups tried to do this a few years ago for human-driven cars, we labeled these resource-abusing startups as “#JerkTech.”

The real opportunity here for a business that doesn’t unfairly profit off the commons is to set up commercial parking lots that use this real-time bidding system.

316,Waymo’s claims of trade secret theft could result in criminal case,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/11/waymos-claims-of-trade-secret-theft-could-result-in-criminal-case/,2017/05/11,"
When Waymo sued Uber earlier this year, claiming that its former employee stole 14,000 documents containing trade secrets about its self-driving car project and took the documents to Uber, it was a stain on Uber’s reputation. Now, it looks like the damage could be more extensive — the judge in the civil case has referred the theft claims to the U.S. Attorney for a possible criminal investigation.
Anthony Levandowski, the engineer accused of stealing the documents, has broadly invoked his 5th Amendment rights against self-incrimination in the case, refusing to answer questions about the documents and his work at his self-driving truck startup Otto or on Uber’s self-driving car project.
Levandowski’s silence has stymied the discovery process in the lawsuit, as Uber has argued that it can’t release documents related to its acquisition of Otto without violating its employee’s 5th Amendment rights.
Judge William Alsup, who is presiding over the civil lawsuit, referred the case to the U.S. Attorney tonight — a move that could result in a criminal investigation into Levandowski’s behavior.
This kind of referral does not guarantee that the U.S. Attorney’s Office will open an investigation or bring any charges against Levandowski. It just opens up the possibility. An Uber spokesperson declined to comment on the referral.
Alsup’s referral is yet another surprise in an already dramatic case. Waymo has accused Levandowski of setting up Otto as a smokescreen, claiming he had no intention of running his own company and always planned to bring Waymo’s secrets to Uber. To back up its explosive claim, Waymo cites legal documents that link Levandowski to Uber just days after he departed Waymo in January of 2016 (Uber didn’t officially acquire Otto until August of that year).
Uber, meanwhile, has maintained that LiDAR experts it hired from Carnegie Mellon independently developed its technology before Levandowski arrived at the company. Uber’s attorneys haven’t said whether Levandowski stole the Waymo files, but say no Waymo files ever made it onto an Uber computer.
“This case is referred to the United States Attorney for investigation of possible theft of trade secrets based on the evidentiary record supplied thus far concerning plaintiff Waymo LLC’s claims for trade secret misappropriation. Said evidentiary record is described in detail in the Court’s order, also issued today, on Waymo’s motion for provisional relief. The Court takes no position on whether a prosecution is or is not warranted, a decision entirely up to the United States Attorney,” Judge Alsup wrote in the referral.
Alsup’s ruling on Waymo’s motion for provisional relief is not yet public. Waymo asked the judge to prevent Levandowski from overseeing Uber’s self-driving efforts — a move Uber claims Levandowski has already made voluntarily — and to prevent Uber from using any of its trade secrets. The latter point is a contentious one between the two companies.
Uber claims that its LiDAR systems were developed independently, while Waymo claims that Uber’s systems rely on its stolen trade secrets and patents. Alsup’s ruling is expected to be made public shortly.

317,"Waymo’s lawsuit against Uber is going to trial, judge rules",https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/11/waymos-lawsuit-against-uber-is-going-to-trial-judge-rules/,2017/05/11,"
Waymo’s lawsuit against Uber, its competitor in the automated vehicle business, is going to trial. Judge William Alsup ruled that Uber could not force the lawsuit over theft of trade secrets into private arbitration.
Instead, the trial will play out publicly, with evidence being presented mostly in the open. This is not the scenario that Uber wanted.
Waymo, the self-driving car subsidiary of Google’s parent company Alphabet, has accused Anthony Levandowski, one of its former engineers, of stealing thousands of confidential documents from Waymo before founding his own self-driving truck startup and eventually going to lead Uber’s self-driving team.
Uber argued unsuccessfully that Waymo’s claims belonged in an arbitration proceeding because of a clause in Levandowski’s employment contract that said disputes between Waymo and Levandowski should be settled in arbitration.
“It is unfortunate that Waymo will be permitted to avoid abiding by the arbitration promise it requires its employees to make. We remain confident in our case and welcome the chance to talk about our independently developed technology in any forum,” an Uber spokesperson told TechCrunch.
But Judge Alsup wrote in his decision that Waymo wasn’t bound to arbitration in this case. “Defendants have repeatedly accused Waymo of using ‘artful’ or ‘tactical’ pleading to evade its arbitration obligations by omitting Levandowski as a defendant,” Judge Alsup wrote. “These accusations are unwarranted.”
Waymo has pursued a separate arbitration against Levandowski and his co-founder Lior Ron over employee poaching. The company claims Levandowski and Ron, also a former Googler, used confidential salary information to poach Google employees to their self-driving truck startup, Otto. Uber acquired Otto in August 2016 in a deal worth roughly $680 million.
“Waymo has honored its obligation to arbitrate against Levandowski by arbitrating its claims (concerning employee poaching) against Levandowski. Its decision to bring separate claims against defendants in court was not only reasonable but also the only course available, since Waymo had no arbitration agreement with defendants. Even though he is not a defendant here, moreover, Levandowski’s assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege has obstructed and continues to obstruct both discovery and defendants’ ability to construct a complete narrative as to the fate of Waymo’s purloined files. As a practical matter, it is hard to imagine how consolidating proceedings as to Levandowski and defendants, whether here or in arbitration, could alleviate these difficulties,” Alsup wrote.
The decision hints that Alsup’s pending decision on a preliminary injunction might not be favorable to Uber. Waymo had asked for the injunction to prevent Uber from using its technology while the case proceeds, and Alsup’s comments in the arbitration ruling suggest he’s not too keen on Uber’s behavior.
If Waymo gets everything it wants from the injunction, it could effectively halt Uber’s self driving development plans entirely while the trial plays out.
In an earlier decision, Alsup said he would release his ruling on both the motion to compel arbitration and the preliminary injunction under seal to both company’s lawyers before making them public. A new entry on the docket for the case notes that Waymo’s motion for a preliminary injunction has been partially granted and partially denied, but it’s not clear yet which of Waymo’s requests the judge will honor.
“This was a desperate bid by Uber to avoid the court’s jurisdiction. We welcome the court’s decision today, and we look forward to holding Uber responsible in court for its misconduct,” a Waymo spokesperson said in a statement.
Update: Judge Alsup has also referred the case to the U.S. Attorney for a possible criminal investigation.

318,Mario Andretti vs. semi-autonomous tech on the track,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/11/mario-andretti-vs-semi-autonomous-tech-on-the-track/,2017/05/11,"
On Saturday, May 13, famed race car driver Mario Andretti will be back on the track at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. This time, he’ll be racing one guy: Sam Schmidt, a quadriplegic race car driver, in semi-autonomous cars.
Schmidt was paralyzed from the neck down in a racing accident in 2000. Since 2014, he’s been working with Arrow Electronics to develop custom-made semi-autonomous Corvette race cars. Things seem to be going well for Schmidt in his new racing career, as he lapped Indy last year 152 mph, averaged 55 mph in the Pike’s Peak Hill Climb with racer Robbie Unser as navigator, and was the first in the nation to receive a drivers license for semi-autonomous driving. And the SAM car, as it’s known, was upgraded to a supercharged Z06 Corvette with 650 horsepower.
Schmidt uses an advanced human-machine interface (HMI) developed by Arrow to drive the car. He controls the steering, brakes, and throttle using a tube he breathes into and movements of his head that are captured by cameras. This is the same system Andretti will use in the head-to-head race on Saturday.
Andretti will actually be in SAM 2.0, Schmidt’s old Corvette Stingray. It’s been upgraded to use the same systems as SAM 3.0, the Corvette Z06, and things like the throttle response have been adjusted to compensate for the power outputs of the cars. Andretti has spent a few days this week learning to use the HMI with the tube and head movements.
“Mario just hopped out of that car. We’re at practice right now,” said Will Pickard, the chief engineer on the SAM project, in a trackside phone interview on Thursday. “He’s grinning ear to ear.”
Andretti has been more than a good sport about the competition; he’s taken it as seriously as he does any race. When he showed up to practice on Wednesday — a day earlier than the SAM team expected — he’d been reading about SAM’s HMI and watching videos of Schmidt. “He’s done his homework,” Pickard said.
“Mario’s one of the best who’s ever been behind a steering wheel,” Pickard added. “Now he’s having to concentrate so hard. He hopped out just exhausted yesterday, but he was going 100 mph. He picked up driving with the HMI really fast. He spent most of the day driving completely with his head.” The system does require stamina; not even Schmidt is up for 20 laps all out yet, Pickard said.
Not that Schmidt is any slouch as a racer, even as a quadriplegic. “The injury didn’t change Sam in terms of his fundamental talent; he just didn’t have a car to drive,” Pickard said. So Arrow worked to develop a car he could really race. “We’ve gotten to the point where Sam is driving the car to its physical limit. We’re burning through tires; he’s hitting apexes and pulling gs.”
Unlike most autonomous car projects, Arrow “is about trying to put a driver back into the driver’s seat,” Pickard explained. SAM 3.0 is a singular project, but the technology translates to real-world applications for drivers with limited mobility.
If you’re the betting type and you’d like to kick a little to charity, you can text SAM or MARIO to 50555. Each text, regardless of who wins on May 13, will donate $10 to Conquer Paralysis Now.
Edited to fix a typo; Schmidt’s accident was in 2000, not 2017.

319,The first EV showcase opens in Oregon,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/08/the-first-ev-showcase-opens-in-oregon/,2017/05/08,"
Forth, the electric vehicle proponent formerly known as Drive Oregon, has opened the nation’s first electric vehicle showcase in downtown Portland, Oregon. Anyone who wants to test drive one of the handful of EVs at the city’s World Trade Center can make a reservation.
There are only three cars on hand so far: the Chevy Bolt, Ford C-MAX Energi, and the Nissan Leaf. Staff will be on hand to help you test e-bikes and learn about charging options and tax breaks that are available for EVs. You can also rent the cars through Turo to get a feel for real-life living with an EV.
The three cars available for testing are from big manufacturers, so you’re probably wondering why they need a special showcase. Why not just sell them off the lot next to other Fords, Chevys, and Nissans? That, my friend, is an excellent question, one that the Sierra Club tackled last year. It turned out that manufacturers were not advertising their plug-in vehicles at nearly the same frequency as their gasoline-powered vehicles.
Despite that lack of EV love from the manufacturers, the US Department of Energy notes that the US plug-in electric vehicle market grew 40% from 2015 to 2016, with 54% of plug-in sales in 2016 being fully electric battery-powered vehicles. China is the champ in the EV market, both in growth (54%), percentage of those plug-in sales that were pure EVs (77%), and sheer numbers — nearly 317,000 plug-in vehicles were sold in China in 2016. The incentives that made that growth possible, though, are set to drop off in the coming years, so they may not be champs for long.
So if the manufacturers aren’t going to get the word out about electric vehicles in the United States, Forth is going to do the work for them — with a $1 million grant from the Department of Energy and matching support from regional partners. Forth also hopes its showcase, which will be in place for three years, will inspire other organizations in other locations to pick up the manufacturers’ and dealerships’ slack when it comes to plug-in vehicles and consumer education. Forth is also taking its showcase on the road with pop-up EV events in the Pacific Northwest.

320,Uber hires Raquel Urtasun to lead a new ATG self-driving unit in Toronto,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/08/uber-hires-raquel-urtasun-to-lead-a-new-atg-self-driving-unit-in-toronto/,2017/05/08,"
Uber is expanding its Advanced Technologies Group (ATG) with a new office in Toronto, headed by local AI researcher Raquel Urtasun, a University of Toronto professor and the Canada Research Chair in Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

Urtasun joins Uber in a senior role at Uber’s ATG, at a time when the organizational unit, which drives most of Uber’s work on autonomous driving, is in need of more stability at the top.
Urtasun’s work on self-driving technology in general, and specifically with perception algorithms that help autonomous vehicles take better measure of their surroundings, have made her an influential figure in the growing self-driving space. She joins a number of other top AI researchers coming out of University of Toronto who have gone on to secure positions of importance at major tech firms; U of T AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton, who heads Google Brain’s Canadian operations, is another.
Uber’s opening of an ATG office in the city also comes with a sizeable contribution to the newly formed Vector Institute, a new research organization funded by federal and provincial government sources, as well as leading local and international technology companies, like Google, Thalmic Labs and more. Urtasun is a founding member of Vector, and described it as an imperative step in helping to make sure that Toronto and Canada retain leadership positions in the field of AI on a global scale.
Still, Urtasun said that while she’s very happy with her academic and research work (and will continue both teaching at the University of Toronto, and devoting time to the Vector Institute), there comes a point when working with industry is the next logical step for furthering progress when it comes to achieving truly autonomous vehicles.

“Doing research in self-driving cars, there is only so much you can do in an academic environment,” she told me in an interview about her decision to at least partially devote her time to a private enterprise. “You really need an industry partner that has resources to really make the difference.”
As for why Uber specifically, Urtasun credits the decision to join the ride hailing company as a result of its team, and specifically those working at the Advanced Technologies Group.
“Since the first time that I visited ATG, I really loved the team,” she said. “And they’re fantastic individuals doing great work, and there was a lot of synergy. There’s also the commitment to those kinds of things that we’re doing in Toronto, and that was a factor in the decision.”
Uber’s ATG group will set up its first operation outside the U.S., at MaRS Discovery District in downtown Toronto, which will also include eight current University of Toronto students on Uber’s payroll.
With Uber’s ATG setting up shop in the city, Canada secures one more reason for AI talent to stay local, and one more reason for global talent to settle in and around Toronto’s growing industry hub. Urtasun previously said of Vector Institute that essentially all of its work will be directly applicable to the task of making self-driving an everyday reality on public roads.
“Toronto has been a leader in AI over the years, really for the past two decades, and there is finally a realization that there is incredible talent, and this talent was mostly being exported to the U.S.,” Urtasun said. “There is now a coming together of local industry, the government and academia to really build a critical system and maintain Toronto as a leader in AI, and this creates opportunities for companies like Uber to benefit from this talent.”

Uber will also be committing to multi-year financial support of the Vector Institute, it’s announcing alongside Urtasun’s hiring. In a blog post announcing the news, Travis Kalanick wrote that this is also intended to help continue to support Toronto’s work in progressing transportation tech via the city’s ongoing commitment to research.
Urtasun’s new role at Uber isn’t without challenges, of course, beyond those of a strictly technical nature. As mentioned, she joins just after Anthony Levandowski, the former head of the ATG, left that role and moved away from working on anything LiDAR-related at Uber as the legal battle between his company and Waymo continues. I asked Urtasun if she had any reservations about joining the company given the situation with Levandowski and Waymo.
She noted that while she could not comment on ongoing lawsuits, her own work has nothing to do with LiDAR tech specifically, and she also wouldn’t be joining the company if she held any reservations.
So what will Urtasun and her team be working on, in terms of Uber’s autonomous driving efforts? Three things, she tells me: Perception, localization and mapping, and general machine learning, too.
“In terms of perception, given sensory data, which is camera, radar, etc.,” she said. “I look at understanding everything that is happening in the scene, as well as predicting what the different actors and traffic participants are going to be doing.”
She also works on localization, or helping a car situate regarding where exactly it is in the world, itself with very little available map information. Urtasun also works on HD mapping efforts, which provide highly defined map information about a vehicle’s surroundings.
The work by Uber doesn’t involve any public trials of vehicles on the road – at least not yet – but it will give Uber access to talent and tech coming from one of the bright spots on the global AI and autonomous driving scene.

321,Inside Intel’s new Autonomous Driving Garage,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/05/inside-intels-new-autonomous-driving-garage/,2017/05/05," 



Intel opened a new Autonomous Driving Garage in San Jose this week, and the facility’s launch gave us an inside look at the kinds of projects the chipmaker is focused on with its driverless business. The relatively young business unit is already doing a lot, from HD mapping, to better wireless connectivity standards, to human machine interaction models, and beyond.
We got the chance to take a first-hand look at a number of these projects, and to speak to Intel execs including its SVP of autonomous driving, Doug Davis, and its head of Artificial Intelligence, Naveen Rao. They provided us some insight into the work Intel is doing, and how it’s working with partners including Delphi to make self-driving a practical, every day reality.
Intel’s new facility is deep in the heart of the autonomous driving and AI tech hub in Silicon Valley, which gives the company better access to partners and potential users of its tech. Intel clearly wants to be a key player in the forthcoming autonomous driving revolution, and this new center should definitely help with that.

Tesla is building a new vehicle platform for its upcoming crossover vehicle. Instead of repurposing the underpinnings of the Model 3 or Model S, Tesla is building something completely new for the Model Y. This comes from Elon Musk speaking on the company’s investor call. Building a new platform takes time; Musk said the Model Y is expected to hit assembly lines in 2020, but could be as early as 2019. And yes, with the Model Y, Tesla’s model line will look like this: S, 3, X, Y.
Building a new platform is a long game for auto manufacturers. It allows for vehicles to share key components, thus improving margins and manufacturing costs when applied to more vehicles. Like most auto makers, Tesla already does this. The Tesla Model X SUV is built on the Model S platform. By building another platform, Tesla is preparing for its next generation of vehicles. Said another way, don’t expect a new Model S or Model X before the Model Y.
Musk said today during the earnings call that his company intends to ditch the 12-volt battery architecture used in Tesla’s vehicles. This is said to reduce the amount of wiring, reducing the manufacturing process and hopefully improving cost. Tesla and other EV makers are still reliant on many of the systems and components — heating, powered seats, infotainment — used in traditional automobiles, and all of these systems run on a 12-volt system. If Musk is successful in moving away from this platform, he would have to convince auto suppliers to move with him or build more of the systems in-house.
Musk has teased the Model Y for months. Before Tesla gets to the Model Y, it needs to deliver the Model 3, which it said today is on track to hit production lines in July.

324,Car2go puts safety in the hands of humans,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/03/car2go-puts-safety-in-the-hands-of-humans/,2017/05/03,"
While nearly every car-related company on the planet is integrating sensors and refining algorithms to create safer cars that eliminate human error, car2go is putting safety back into human hands. A pilot program in New York City and Washington, DC will give 1,000 car2go members free online driving courses.
The courses are provided by the National Safety Council, and the drivers who complete them will get drive-time credits with car2go. The car-sharing company plans to choose 1,000 members at random in those two cities in the next month, then roll out the program to other users and cities if it’s successful.
This is part of car2go joining the Road to Zero Coalition, a coalition whose goal is to bring traffic-related deaths to zero within the next 30 years. The coalition includes public and private organizations, like the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, AAA and the National Association of Counties.
Daimler owns car2go, as well as Smart and Mercedes-Benz, and the car-sharing service is already moving from a fleet of mostly Smart Fortwo cars to a fleet of mostly Mercedes-Benz vehicles. So far, the rollout has included Mercedes CLA- and GLA-class cars, which have high-tech safety systems like adaptive braking and blind-spot monitoring. So it’s not like car2go is foregoing the tech angle completely.
Even with a fleet of mostly Smart cars, which are not all that high-tech, the 800,000 members of car2go in the U.S. and Canada traveled 59 million miles in 2016 with fewer than 1,000 traffic incidents. The company already educates it users on sharing the road with bicycles and has a zero tolerance policy for impaired driving.

325,Tesla’s Q1 revenue more than doubles year-over-year as Model 3 plan remains on track,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/03/teslas-q1-revenue-more-than-doubles-year-over-year-as-model-3-plan-remains-on-track/,2017/05/03,"
Tesla today re-affirmed that the production of its next car, the Model 3, would begin in July — and that the company had $4 billion in cash-on-hand heading into the second quarter this year.
Both of those are going to be critical as Tesla, which reported its first-quarter earnings today, heads into the back half of the year. The company has gone to market multiple times to raise additional capital, and said year-to-date capital expenditures would be slightly over $2 billion by the time it started Model 3 production. With a lower price point, the Model 3 opens Tesla up to a wider market that could help it justify its ballooning valuation.

Tesla reported a loss of $1.33 per share on revenue of $2.7 billion, while Wall Street expected a loss of 83 cents per share on $2.61 billion in revenue. While it was a wider-than-expected loss, it looks like a pretty ho-hum result for the company as all eyes look toward the later part of the year when the Model 3 production is in full swing — and whether Tesla will be able to get enough cars rolling out.
In April, Tesla’s continued rising stock price valued the company more than Ford. That came on the heels of the company saying its vehicle production and deliveries rose in the first quarter at a rate faster than what Wall Street expected. Shares of Tesla were largely unchanged today, with the company worth more than $50 billion (still well above Ford).


In April, Musk gave a sort of teaser to a new semi-truck from Tesla. The company is also expected to reveal the final production version of the Model 3 in July. But the Model 3 is likely still going to be on the top of everyone’s minds, with a $35,000 price tag that’s targeting a market looking for a less expensive electric car. (Calling $35,000 less expensive is still, of course, a matter of perspective.)
Tesla said it still expects to have between 47,000 to 50,000 deliveries in the first half of the year. Though, as the Model 3 begins production, it may face a bit of an optics problem — where it stacks up against the Model S. Tesla also acknowledged the problem in its earnings report.
“Moving past Q2, particularly as Model 3 becomes available, one of our challenges will be to eliminate any misperception about the differences between Model S and Model 3,” the company said in a statement. “We have seen a belief among some that Model 3 is the newest and more advanced generation of Model S. This is not correct. Model S will always have more range, more acceleration, more power, more passenger cargo room, more displays (two), and more customization choices, and Model S, X and 3 will all have equivalent Autopilot functionality. We will continue to clearly communicate these distinctions to avoid any misperceptions.”

326,Waymo case reveals Levandowski got $250 million in Uber stock for Otto,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/03/waymo-case-reveals-levandowski-got-250-million-in-uber-stock-for-otto/,2017/05/03,"
Autonomous driving company Waymo alleged today in court that the formation of rival Otto was a ruse concocted between its founder Anthony Levandowski and eventual acquirer Uber to hide the fact that he immediately went to work for the ride-hailing company after leaving Waymo’s parent company, Google.
To prove its case, Waymo points to a stock grant with a vesting date of January 28, 2016 — the day after Levandowski resigned without notice — that grants Levandowski more than 5 million shares in Uber. The shares are estimated to be worth more than $250 million.
Uber, meanwhile, maintains that none of Waymo’s intellectual property ever made it onto Uber’s computers or into its LiDAR technology. The startup contends that Waymo ought to hash out its problems with Levandowski in arbitration.
Uber and Waymo are facing off in court today in their ongoing lawsuit over trade secret and patent infringement, where Waymo is seeking an injunction against Uber that would stop it from using Waymo’s trade secrets in its self-driving car technology.
Waymo claims that a former engineer, Anthony Levandowski, stole 14,000 confidential files before leaving the company to start an autonomous truck company, Otto. Uber later acquired Otto in a deal worth about $680 million.
An Uber spokesperson said that the stock grant was issued around the time of the Otto acquisition in August 2016, and that it is common for vesting deals to back-date to the formation of an acquired startup. Levandowski’s stock grant is conditional, based on technical milestones — so he would have to deliver technology in exchange for stock. So far, none of his shares have vested.
While Waymo says the date of the agreement shows that Uber planned to acquire Otto much earlier than originally disclosed, Uber says the actual date of the agreement was much later. This point will likely be a pivotal one in the case ahead.
Waymo also displayed emails in court today sent between Uber executives. The emails showed discussions about meeting with Levandowski and the formation of a new company, referred to as “NewCo.”
One email showed Brian McClendon, an executive who formerly worked on Google Maps before joining Uber, discussing a meeting with Levandowski about LiDAR that allegedly took place January 13, 2016. Waymo has previously alleged that Levandowski met with Uber execs before his departure from Google. Another email on which McClendon was cc’ed contained an attachment labeled “NewCo_Milestones_v5” and noted, “This list of deliverables is a high bar for sure. But then again so is what [Levandowski] is asking for in $$.” (McClendon resigned from Uber in March.)
Waymo also showed notes created by Scott Boehmke, a LiDAR expert Uber hired from Carnegie Mellon, that referenced “NewCo” as early as October 2015.
Uber said in previous court filings that it considered using Otto as a third-party vendor for LiDAR technology before acquiring it outright. “Bohemke was doing analysis of what LiDAR was out there. At some point there was communication with Levandowski that he might be able to provide a LiDAR from his company,” Uber attorney Arturo Gonzalez said.
Despite the new documents presented by Waymo, Judge William Alsup appeared skeptical that Waymo could prove Uber is using its trade secrets and justify a preliminary injunction. “You didn’t sue [Levandowski], you sued Uber,” Alsup said. “What if it turns out that Uber is totally innocent? Let’s say they are totally innocent and the worst thing they did was pay a lot of money to hire a brilliant guy away from a competitor without realizing that he was downloading all this information?”
Waymo’s attorney responded that the company expects to prove the use of its trade secrets once it is able to pry more documents from Uber. Due to a joint defense agreement between Uber and Otto, Uber has claimed that it can’t release certain documents related to the acquisition. Uber’s lawyers have already conducted an extensive search for Waymo documents — but so far, they’ve only found one.

327,Nissan’s Faraday cage armrest is the abstinence of mobile driving distraction,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/03/nissans-faraday-cage-armrest-is-the-abstinence-of-mobile-driving-distraction/,2017/05/03,"

Nissan has released details of a new prototype it designed to help drivers keep their mind on the super dangerous and highly complicated task of driving, which is the only thing they should be paying attention to when behind the wheel of many thousands of pounds of high-speed metal and combustible gas. The Nissan Signal Shield is an arrest compartment that doubles as a Faraday cage, blocking all wireless signals when throw your phone inside and shut the lid.
The prototype reveal comes as automakers, regulators, device and mobile software makers alike are all trying to figure out creative solutions to the growing problem of distracted driving. Smartphones and tablets are basically designed to be addictive, but that presents a problem when that desire to mess around with them extends to your time behind the wheel. One of Nissan’s proposed solutions is an invention from the 1830s, albeit updated for the urban professional with stylish trim and direct integration into the Nissan Juke’s front center armrest.
NISSAN SIGNAL SHIELD CONCEPT
A Faraday cage is a nice idea, and if your smartphone happens to develop sentient AI while it’s in your Signal Shield, at least the rest of the world’s networks will be protected – but it’s ultimately subject to the same failings as more pedestrian means of silencing your phone’s constant calls for attention, including Airplane Mode.
That weakness is willpower: A human is just as likely to be able and willing to keep their smartphone enclosed in the in-car Faraday cage as they are to reliably turn on Airplane mode and ignore their device while driving, which is to say not very likely at all. It is, as the headline suggests, like preaching abstinence as an effective means of preventing teen sex and pregnancy – an optimistic, naive fiction.
One thing this prototype does illustrate is the need to continue working on full autonomy, which is probably the only real solution to distracted driving, especially as opportunities for distractions seem to be getting more numerous, not less.

328,Mapillary opens up 25k street-level images to train automotive AI systems,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/03/mapillary-open-sources-25k-street-level-images-to-train-automotive-ai-systems/,2017/05/03,"
As more companies wade into the business of building artificial intelligence systems to help you drive (or do the driving for you), a startup founded by an ex-Apple computer vision specialist is open sourcing a huge dataset that can help them on their road to autonomy.
Mapillary, a Swedish startup backed by Sequoia, Atomico and others that has built a database of 130 million images through crowdsourcing — think open-source Street View — is releasing a free dataset of 25,000 street-level images from 190 countries, with pixel-level annotations that can be used to train automotive AI systems.
The Mapillary Vistas Dataset claims to be “the world’s largest, most diverse dataset for object recognition on street-level imagery.” As with the rest of Mapillary’s photos, the startup builds its image database on top of Mapbox and OpenStreetMap maps.
The dataset is free for both academic and commercial researchers, and if anyone wants to build the results into commercial products, they must pay a commercial license.
As Jan-Erik Solem, the CEO and co-founder, explained, while there are other datasets that companies are using to train the machine learning algorithms for their in-car systems, these fall short because they “do not have enough variability and coverage to be useful in real-world scenarios.”
This Vistas dataset is built on top of regular Mapillary images, where most of the images come from crowdsourcing. “What we have done here is that we manually selected 25,000 images with the variability we wanted from the 130+ million available on Mapillary,” Solem explained. “Then we manually annotated them to label all the pixels in the images. This is a tedious and expensive manual labor process.”
Expensive, and yet now free to use, because of the companies that are “sponsoring” the work, Solem said.
Sponsors of this dataset are Lyft, Toyota and Daimler, some of whom received pre-release data, he added. It’s not clear exactly how these three companies may be using the datasets, beyond making their own autonomous driving systems smarter and more fail-safe.
“This is our main dataset for training our own algorithms. Our own need was one of the reasons for creating this dataset,” Solem noted.
You can see a visual progression of how ordinary pictures transform into pixel-level annotated data sets in the gif above, and how a final product looks in the image below, ready to plug into your machine learning engine.

Mapillary, it should be pointed out, has yet to reveal much about who its paying customers are these days. “We’re just about to tell the world,” Solem said when I asked him about this, although the three companies sponsoring the Vista dataset are probably good guesses.
Mapillary describes its wider dataset as one that is used to help build smart cities, future maps, and autonomous vehicles. Using computer vision, Mapillary “reads” images that have been uploaded to its database to identify locations in 3D and recognise and order objects within them.
When we wrote about Mapillary’s most recent funding round — $8 million from Sequoia, Atomico, LDV Capital, and PlayFair in March 2016 — we noted that the company had signed up various organizations to use its data. They included the Swedish town of Helsingborg, Los Angeles County, the World Bank and the Red Cross (although, again, whether these are paying or free users is not clear).
The company does have a set of pricing tiers that point to its B2B focus: the database is free for the first 50,000 views of images with no data requests; $250 per month for up to 500,000 views and 250 data requests; and then priced on a case-by-case if you are using more than this.
“As a business we provide images, data automatically extracted from these images, and processing services for clients that have their own imagery but don’t want to share that on public Mapillary,” Solem said. “Our markets are mapping, automotive, and GIS (Geographical Information Systems). We’re in early stages revenue-wise and 2017 will be a very interesting year for us as a business.”

While crowdsourcing can be a tricky and inconsistent way to build a database, it’s notable that Mapillary’s crowdsourcing is something of a closed loop.
Those who use the platform also contribute to Mapillary’s wider database, which means that the system is building stronger datasets exactly in the locations where there is demand at the moment, without filling in the blanks for other places, which will be populated more as and when the need to do so arises — not unlike how Waze was built in its early days, well before getting acquired by Google.
“When it comes to image contributions to Mapillary in general, people are self-motivated and contribute because we help them solve problems they have,” Solem explained. “This can be sharing of places and place data, inventory work, mapping work, and map editing.”
Solem has impressive credentials in the area of computer vision. His previous company — the Malmo, Sweden-based facial recognition startup Polar Rose — was quietly acquired by Apple in 2010. He subsequently joined the iPhone maker to work on computer vision and other projects for several years after that.

Mapillary’s existence is an interesting development in the bigger world of digital mapping services. These are used not just as cornerstones in how smartphones work, but are central to how a lot of the next wave of computing is being shaped. That leads to inevitable questions of who should rightfully own this kind of potentially very central and crucial data.


Interestingly, although Solem put in significant time at Apple — one of potentially only a few big commercial players digital mapping alongside Google and the car consortium that now owns Here (formerly Nokia) — now Solem is singing a different tune when it comes to creating and long-term ownership of mapping datasets.
“I think it is worrisome that in mapping things are being consolidated into a few players,” he told me back when Mapillary raised its last round of funding. “It’s bad because it means that data moves into silos and very little is shared again. When Apple picks up companies and puts their data into Apple Maps, they disappear. A lot of the data that used to be provided is gone. And Apple has no interest in providing that info to anyone else. There are certain things that you should keep independent.”
Independent, and ready for many and any others to use as they will.

329,Nutonomy teams up with Peugeot-maker Groupe PSA for self-driving car tests in Singapore,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/03/nutonomy-peugeot-citroen-groupe-psa/,2017/05/03,"
Nutonomy, the self-driving car startup that span out of MIT in 2013, has inked a deal that will see it work with Peugeot-maker Groupe PSA to test autonomous vehicles in Singapore.
Nutonomy is more than familiar with Singapore: it has a relationship with local Uber rival Grab and the Singapore Economic Development Board was an investor in its recent $16 million fundraising. This new tie-in will see its autonomous vehicle tech, which includes software and sensors, integrated into a customized version of the Peugeot 3008. Trials will take place on public roads in Singapore from September, both companies confirmed.
Cambridge, MA-based Nutonomy has an office in Singapore, and beyond the city-state it has also conducted tests in the Boston area, too. (Side note: it actually beat Uber to become the first company to test (so-called) ‘robo-taxis’ on public roads although reports suggest it has plenty of work to do on stabilizing the passenger experience.) This deal with Groupe PSA, which also manufactures Citroen cars, will push the startup forward towards its ambitious goal of deploying commercial robo-taxis in Singapore by 2018.
“We’re confident that working with Groupe PSA will bring us closer to our goal of deploying a safe, efficient, fully autonomous mobility-on-demand transportation service for urban driving environments,” Nutonomy CEO and co-founder Karl lagnemma said in a statement.
As for Groupe PSA, the French automaker announced its self-driving car program last year. To date, it has tested autonomous vehicles across Europe while, most recently, it revealed plans for pilots with “non-expert” drivers on French roads.
“This collaboration is a significant step towards fully autonomous vehicles, which will enable us to offer different mobility solutions to our customers,” said Anne Laliron, head of the business lab at Groupe PSA.

330,Samsung now approved to test self-driving cars on South Korean roads,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/01/samsung-now-approved-to-test-self-driving-cars-on-south-korean-roads/,2017/05/01,"
Samsung is working on self-driving cars — which shouldn’t surprise you if you know the company’s history and wide range of interests. What’s new, however, is that Samsung is the latest company to receive approval from the South Korean government to begin testing its self-driving tech on public roads in the country.
South Korea’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport gave the OK on Monday, The Korea Herald reports, clearing the way for Samsung to start testing its modified Hyundai test car, which is equipped with sensor and camera equipment needed to run Samsung’s software for autonomous driving.
Hyundai was actually the first to gain approval to test autonomous tech on South Korean roads, having cleared the hurdle more than a year ago in February, 2016. Regulations have also eased in that time: Companies can now test vehicles with just one human driver, where the rule when first implemented required at least two people on board during testing.
California is also looking to ease its requirements. South Korea’s recent rule changes also include laying the groundwork for allowing vehicles without any steering wheels or pedals, which is part of the proposed amendments to California regulations; Michigan recently passed a law that allows for the same.

331,Self-driving cars share space with Shakespeare at new Ontario test site,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/01/self-driving-cars-share-space-with-shakespeare-at-new-ontario-test-site/,2017/05/01,"
Self-driving cars in Canada have a new designated test site in the province of Ontario: Stratford, which is also home to the annual Stratford Festival, an event celebrating Shakespearean and other stage plays. Autonomous-vehicle testing in Stratford will provide a focal point for development done across six technology centers located at different points around the province before heading to the dramatic proving ground.
Stratford is relatively close to a number of Canada’s leading universities, including the University of Waterloo, where autonomous-vehicle development is already well underway. It’s also within easy reach of many automaker technology hubs located in the province, and close enough to hand for large tech companies with significant engineering centers in Canada, including Google, which has a Waterloo engineering office.
The full details of Stratford’s testing facilities, including whether they will involve open trials on public roads, remain to be seen. The first self-driving street tests started taking place in Ontario last November under a pilot project in which a small group of select technology research projects were greenlighted to test their tech.
Stratford will benefit from public funding as part of the deal, and the town sees the opportunity as a chance to encourage more industry to grow up in the area. The city has been recognized as a “smart city,” with a focus on digital technology development in recent years.

332,Verizon stakes a self-driving claim with investment in Renovo,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/01/verizon-stakes-a-self-driving-claim-with-investment-in-renovo/,2017/05/01,"
Verizon (disclosure: Verizon owns Aol, which owns TechCrunch) has invested in self-driving software startup Renovo, which wants to become an autonomous operating system provider to leading automakers and fleet operators. The investment comes as part of a new $10 million round led by True Ventures, The Wall Street Journal reports, and boosts the total funding raised by the company to $14.5 million across two rounds.
Renovo’s been around since 2010, but made its first big splash in 2015 when it debuted a video of a self-driving DeLorean developed with Stanford doing autonomous donuts. The company recently joined the list of those allowed to perform self-driving vehicle tests on public roads in California; the state lists permit holders on its public-facing website.

Verizon staking out some territory in the self-driving space with an investment in Renovo is a strategic move, as the carrier sees its network and services as a core component of an autonomous driving future. Data transfer and collection will indeed be a huge part of bringing self-driving cars to consumers, both in the form of individual cars and via self-driving fleets of ride-hailing vehicles of the kind being planned by Ford, GM and others.

333,Auto site Carvana tumbles 26% in stock market debut,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/28/auto-site-carvana-tumbles-26-in-stock-market-debut/,2017/04/28,"
Carvana, the site for buying and selling cars, had a rough first day in the public markets. After pricing its IPO at $15 per share, it ended the day down 26 percent, at $11.10.
Bankers typically recommend a price that would cause the shares to go up about 20 percent or so on the first day, known as a “pop.” But Carvana maximized every last dollar in its $225 million offering, at the cost of new investors.
They’re still hoping the IPO will raise their profile and bring about new customers. Carvana wants to make shopping for a car as easy as buying a book on Amazon.
“We built a website that’s very easy to navigate,” CEO and founder Ernie Garcia, told TechCrunch. “The customer response has been very strong.”
With vending machines in Texas and Tennessee, customers can buy a car without having to interface with pesky salesmen. They also can order directly on the website and get free shipping if they live in one of the 21 target markets, primarily in the eastern half of the country. Others throughout the continental U.S. can still order cars through Carvana, but may have to pay for shipping.
These aren’t new cars. They are older vehicles that Carvana obtains directly from consumers, rental car fleets or expired leases.
Carvana’s revenue is growing fast. Last year they brought in $365.1 million in revenue, compared to $130.4 million the year before and $41.7 million the year before that.
But losses are growing, too. The company lost $93.1 million last year, compared to $36.8 million the year before.
When asked about a growing portion of young people shunning car ownership in the age of Uber, Garcia downplayed concerns. “There are certain markets where that’s a trend,” but he’s selling to a “broad mix of customers.”
Launched just four years ago, Phoenix, Arizona-based Carvana doesn’t fit the profile of a typical internet IPO.  Like its Silicon Valley brethren, Carvana received funding prior to the IPO, but instead chose not to share investor names. The S-1 filing only shows CEO Ernest Garcia and CVAN Holdings as 5 percent stockholders, the threshold for required disclosure.

It’s hard to say what valuation the company raised at, but its $1.5 billion public market cap puts it in “unicorn” territory.
Carvana wasn’t the only tech company to debut Friday. Taking advantage of an open IPO “window,” Cloudera also went public and priced its shares at $15. Unlike Carvana, Cloudera’s shares closed up more than 20 percent.
Both companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

334,California orders RydenGo to shut down its website,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/28/california-orders-rydengo-to-shut-down-its-website/,2017/04/28,"
On April 13, the state of California issued a cease and desist letter to RydenGo, saying that the company had to take down its website. The letter stated that the ride-hailing startup was operating without a permit from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).
The problem with the order, according to RydenGo CEO Michael Pappas, is that the company is not yet operating. It does have a website, which is still up, and people who would like to drive for RydenGo in the near future are encouraged to sign up for the beta team. But there are no cars to be hailed on the streets yet. “We don’t have apps or anything for download,” Pappas said in a phone interview. “Just the form to be filled out for the future.”
Pappas called the CPUC and spoke with the man who issued the letter. He was told that he needed to take the website down, and then, according to Pappas, the official hung up on him.
“I have never run into anything like this before,” Pappas said. “I’ve heard of it, but those companies are usually farther along.” He went on to explain that “circumstances are different because landscapes are different. RydenGo is needling others and challenging the rideshare industry as it is today. It could change the industry in a positive direction.”
He noted that RydenGo is focusing on developing its corporate culture before beginning operations. “The technology is mature,” Pappas said. “You can get tech like that [a ride-hailing app] built in months. It’s more important to build the company from the top down and what it stands for. RydenGo is driver- and people-centric. We want to give them control and stop exploitation.”
The idea seems to be resonating with people. A week after the cease and desist letter, RydenGo added text to its beta team signup saying that due to the “overwhelming” number of signups, the company would let people add new cities to the company’s short list. Originally, there were about two dozen cities where RydenGo hoped to start operations in the fall; that number could be greater if the beta team is any indication. Several California locations are on the original short list, including Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco.
Pappas isn’t arguing with the CPUC’s regulatory role. He understands the need to protect the public and the need for safety, and he agrees with the agency’s role in making that happen. “Ride-hailing companies cannot run on the streets with a beta app. I totally understand and see the need for that,” he said. “But telling us to take down the website — that was the weird part.”
As of April 28, the order had not been pursued nor rescinded by the state of California.

335,Apple offers feedback on California’s proposed driverless testing rule changes,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/28/apple-offers-ca-dmv-driverless-feedback/,2017/04/28,"
Apple has offered feedback to the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) concerning its proposed new rule changes regarding autonomous vehicle testing on state roads. The formal feedback provided by Apple is relatively short and to the point, contained in a letter submitted to the DMV and embedded below, signed by Apple Director of Product Integrity Steve Kenner (who also authored the letter that first revealed Apple’s autonomy ambitions).
In short, Apple suggests some changes to disengagement reporting that tighten the definition, which would result in fewer incidents requiring a report when an autonomous driving software system is turned off while a vehicle is driving. Apple also asks for clarifications around necessity of safety drivers during testing, loosen some requirements around what kind of vehicles can qualify for use during testing, and that it add in some language around stopping fallback tech in sections detailing testing without safety drivers on board.
The DMV is seeking to expand testing to include scenarios where there isn’t actually a human safety driver present behind the wheel, which would be a crucial step towards making driverless cars on roads in a commercial service capacity a viable reality for companies hoping to do things like offer autonomous delivery and ride hailing services.
Apple’s letter also reveals some interesting details about the company’s thinking on the matter of automation in general, and autonomous driving in particular. Apple says in the note that it “is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.”

Elon Musk was on stage at the 2017 TED Conference in Vancouver on Friday, and he revealed some of his tunnel work and aspirations, but he also talked about a few ongoing Tesla projects he’s referenced before. The multi-CEO showed a shadowy image that gives us our first look at what his forthcoming electric Semi Truck will look like, and also let drop the suggestion that Tesla will likely announce four new global Gigafactory locations sometime this year.


Elon Musk teased semi-truck at TED talk. pic.twitter.com/sY0w7KSsTx
— Johana Bhuiyan (@JMBooyah) April 28, 2017



The truck looks exactly like you’d expect a transport truck to look, roughly, but with a smooth continuous design between the windshield and the upper facade. There’s also headlights that resemble the ones used on existing Tesla cars, including the Model X and Model S, so it’s reasonable to expect some design continuity between Tesla’s consumer and commercial vehicles.
The truck gets more from Tesla’s existing lineup than just its looks – the CEO said on stage that it’ll be a “spry” vehicle, which can be driven like a sports car. Musk said he himself has already taken the prototype for a ride.
We’ll still have to wait until September to see the truck in its full glory, but Musk said it should be able to not only hold its own with, but also outperform current diesel-powered big rigs.
Meanwhile, Musk also said that there will be likely four new Gigafactory sites announced this year. This is also something Tesla has touched on before; the company said in its most recent earnings report that it plans to finalize locations for up to three new Gigafactory sites this year, in addition to the existing Nevada location, and the New York plant for solar technology it’s operating in partnership with Panasonic.
Electrek recently reported that Musk’s meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang could’ve included discussions around a possible Gigafactory site, which follows a recent significant investment by giant Chinese Internet firm Tencent.

337,Watch how Elon Musk’s Boring Company tunnels will move cars faster,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/28/watch-how-elon-musks-boring-company-tunnels-will-move-cars-faster/,2017/04/28,"

Just what does Elon Musk’s Boring Company want to accomplish? This might be our clearest picture yet – a video shown during Musk’s TEDTalk from Friday morning, which includes a rendering of a future underground transit network where cars travel on crisscrossing layers of tunnels that include sleds shuttling vehicles around on rails at around 130 mph.

Musk’s vision includes parking spots that are actually elevator shaft entrances, where drivers can pull in and descend to the network below. Once underground, the car will travel along in a sled, merging with other tunnels and being integrated seamlessly into a network that includes other packets, all controlled by computer for maximum efficiency.

Traveling in this way will allow speeds to exceed what’s possible on the surface, and result in network optimization of routing that’s not unlike what happens with packets of data in a broadband communications network powering the Internet today.

The network would have advantages over surface routes not just because of intelligent routing, but also because of its 3D structure – above ground, roadways can only really stack at most two or three deep, and generally theirs really only one. Underground, there’s potential for many layers crisscrossing one another, which helping optimize for whatever destinations a driver may have.
Musk said on stage at the event that he only really spends about two to three percent of his time on The Boring Company, which means this vision is still likely a very far-off one in terms of becoming a real thing people can actually use.

338,BMW’s plug-in hybrid 530e iPerformance will get wireless charging,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/28/bmws-plug-in-hybrid-530e-iperformance-will-get-wireless-charging/,2017/04/28,"
BMW revealed its newest electric vehicle, a plug-in hybrid called the 530e iPerformance. The variant’s options include a forthcoming wireless charging pad, targeting a 2018 release window, which will include a charging pad drivers can install in their garage and drive over to provide a power supply with rates up to 3.2 kW, with a total charging time for refilling the vehicle’s onboard battery of about three and a half hours.
BMW is already showing the wireless pad and its charging capabilities in prototype form, and the system includes visual feedback and instructions for the driver via the in-car infotainment dash display, so that they know when they’ve pulled in for an optimal charging connection. Wireless charging is a big carrot for EVs and hybrids, since it takes away the added mental component involved in remembering to plug your car in once you’re done driving. It seems like a small thing, but it goes against many decades of learned behavior for most drivers.

The other interesting component here is that BMW is offering its Digital Charging Service for the 530e iPerformance, which intelligently manages charging when plugged in so that the car remains topped off for when it needs to drive. The service also adjusts the planned charging to draw power mostly during off-peak hours, and to prefer power supplied by the customer’s own solar power generation capacity, if they have both that and BMW’s Wallbox Connect dedicated vehicle charging solution.
Getting customers excited about electric vehicles is in part about making sure they see that it’s also not going to change their lives dramatically in terms of their daily routine and how they use their cars. These charging technologies help with that, and wireless charging in particular should be a hit if BMW can deliver it as promised.

339,Apple’s self-driving test Lexus SUV photographed on Silicon Valley roads,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/28/apples-self-driving-test-lexus-suv-photographed-on-silicon-valley-roads/,2017/04/28,"
Apple’s using a Lexus RX450h SUV for its autonomous vehicle testing program, as revealed by documents filed with the California DMV in accordance with licensing requirements for self-driving tests in the state. Now, Bloomberg has images of the vehicle in action, captured by a chance observer who saw the vehicle pull out of an Apple facility in Silicon Valley.
The SUV looks pretty much like similar test cars used by Waymo, the former Google self-driving car company whose headquarters are pretty much just down the road from Apple’s Cupertino HQ. The equipment adorning the SUV include optical cameras, LiDAR, and radar, all of which appear to be off-the-shelf components, including Velodyne’s top-of-the-line LiDAR unit atop a frame that extends a few feet out from the roof of the vehicle.
Judging by these spy shots and the information found in the DMV documents made public by a public records request, Apple is very early in its autonomous technology program compared to companies like Waymo (which has been developing its tech for nearly a decade), and even Uber. The test vehicle’s lack of any obvious custom parts suggest that, at least at this stage, the company’s emphasis is on software development first and foremost.
We already knew that Apple had some kind of self-driving test program in place, and we already knew what vehicles it was using, but seeing images of the SUV on the road is still a bit like getting a glimpse of an elusive and previously mythical white whale.

340,StreetDrone’s new autonomous electric car is made for the education market,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/28/streetdrones-new-autonomous-electric-car-is-made-for-the-education-market/,2017/04/28,"
Self-driving cars are popping up all over, but UK-based StreetDrone thinks it should be easier for the education market to pick one up, ready with all the sensors and tech on board they need to provide the basis for research and study. That’s why they created the StreetDrone ONE, an electric vehicle built using the Renault Twizy with a suite of autonomous driving sensors, ready for self-driving study.
The StreetDrone ONE is intended to offer a hands-on learning opportunity for students who would like to explore the growing field of self-driving tech, and comes in a number of package options with different sensor loadouts and connectivity options. Fully equipped, the StreetDrone ONE has Velodyne LiDAR, a 360-degree camera, 4 lower resolution optical cameras and RADAR, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi though you can tweak the configurations to only include a few of those, depending on what you need. It’s modular by design, too, so researchers and students can supplement their own parts and software.
This car is kind of like the Raspberry Pi of autonomous cars, relatively speaking, and is meant to make it more affordable for educational institutions to offer up direct, real-world experience working on self-driving cars before students get into the marketplace. The vehicle is up for pre-order now, and will start to roll out to UK university customers beginning in August.
Others have sought to capitalize on the growing demand for autonomous vehicle platforms; one supplier has been very active in the corporate sector, offering up Lexus cars retrofitted with off-the-shelf sensor suites to help companies like Nvidia get started with their programs without much ramp up required. Targeting schools is a smart strategy, however, and one that’s likely to put StreetDrone in a strong position as universities and colleges continue to build up this area of their educational program as a response to market demand.

341,Uber’s Anthony Levandowski out as Advanced Technologies lead amid legal fight,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/27/ubers-anthony-levandowki-out-as-advanced-technologies-lead-amid-legal-fight/,2017/04/27,"
Uber’s Anthony Levandowski, who founded Otto and then became head of Uber’s Advanced Technologies Group (ATG) once Otto was acquired by the ride-sharing company, is stepping aside from his role as head of ATG. The move comes as Uber continues a legal fight with Waymo, which began as Waymo accused Levandowski of using trade secrets stolen during his time at the then-Google self-driving car project to create lidar tech used by Otto and then Uber in their own autonomous vehicle efforts.
Levandowski will remain at Uber, despite his role change, though an internal email to his team first reported by Business Insider and confirmed as genuine by TechCrunch reveals he won’t be working on “all LiDAR-related work and management” at the company, which includes basically anything related to lasers, the company says. The new head of ATG will be Eric Meyhofer, who joined Uber from Carnegie Robotics prior to Uber’s acquisition of Otto, and who is therefore not directly implicated in the legal drama surrounding the self-driving truck company. Meyhofer will report directly to Uber CEO Travis Kalanick.

The move comes less than a week before a court is set to decide whether to issue a preliminary injunction that could prevent Levandowski from working on Uber’s self-driving car unit, or even shut down Uber’s lidar development altogether. Levandowski removing himself from lidar development could be seen as a last-ditch effort to distance himself from the project in hopes that a judge will allow it to continue without his supervision.
Levandowski is accused of stealing more than 14,000 confidential documents related to Waymo’s lidar systems. A TechCrunch investigation revealed that he was questioned extensively about the arrangement of circuit boards in Uber’s lidar, and Waymo has accused him of stealing information regarding every generation of circuit board it’s ever developed.

342,Navdy’s new Glympse integration lets you share a live ETA from the road,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/27/navdys-new-glympse-integration-lets-you-share-a-live-eta-from-the-road/,2017/04/27,"
If you’ve ever been driving and wanted to let someone know when to expect you, there’s likely been some kind of compromise involved where you broke a few rules and texted while en route. There are more than a few problems with that, however, including how it involves breaking the law, and also how it means that if you encounter any delays, your ETA is pretty much worthless to whomever you’re communicating with.
Aftermarket HUD maker Navdy (which I reviewed recently, in case you want to learn more) is giving its users an easier way to share their expected arrival time, through a new partnership with Glympse. Glympse, as you may already know, is a tool that lets you share (with anyone you can message) your ETA via a live, updating map, temporarily providing location info so people you care about can know when to expect you, and receive updates as your trip evolves.

The Navdy partnership means users of the HUD can now find contacts using the Navdy dial on their steering wheel during a drive, choose from a range of canned message options, including “On my way,” and then send a message with a link that gives that contact a host of real-time info about your trip, including your expected arrival time, the route you’re following on your own Navdy and your destination.
It’s actually a pretty handy new feature, provided you’re comfortable sharing said info through Glympse. The convenience benefits are clear, however, and given that people are generally very likely to want to share ETA data during drives anyway, Navdy’s interface makes it possible with the least amount of distraction required.

SiriusXM has acquired Automatic, the maker of the Automatic Pro and Automatic Lite connected car OBD-II port accessories. The deal is acknowledged by SiriusXM CFO David Frear to be worth a little north of $100 million, and SiriusXM and Automatic both note in releases announcing the news that the brand will remain separate, and Automatic’s products and team will remain focused on the same mission. For Automatic users, the change won’t provide any disruption to their device use, Automatic says.
The acquisition of Automatic adds to SiriusXM’s connected car product offerings, and means that the company remains more relevant in a world where users are increasingly relying on smartphone-based media services for in-car entertainment.
SiriusXM emphasized the opportunity represented in the growing market of driving data, which is a business that automakers and the surrounding industry is increasingly trying to leverage into new revenue opportunities. Automatic has already been forming partnership with insurance providers, for instance, which value the driving data it collects and will offer subsidies to policy holders who use the device. SiriusXM has recently been exploring more of this market, with a new focus on safety products, turn-by-turn navigation and more connected car services.
Automatic’s operations will continue to be based in San Francisco. Its products offer device owners tips on fuel-efficient driving, as well as automatic crash alert services via its always-on 3G connected Pro model, and a number of third-party integrations for things like expense tracking.

344,China’s Didi Chuxing is raising up to $6 billion at a valuation of over $50 billion,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/27/didi-chuxing-to-become-worlds-second-highest-valued-startup/,2017/04/27,"
Didi Chuxing, the on-demand giant that drove Uber out of China, is set to become the world’s second-highest valued tech startup.
Beijing-based Didi is in the process of raising a round that could reach as high as $6 billion at a valuation that would exceed $50 billion, a source with knowledge of discussions told TechCrunch. That’s not far from Uber itself, which is said to be valued at over $60 billion. Bloomberg originally reported the raise, rumors of which first began circulating last month.
Didi declined to comment.
The new deal would represent a significant hike on the company’s most recent $28 billion valuation when it closed a colossal $7.3 billion investment that included money from Apple and China Life.
The $50 billion-plus valuation would also make Didi the tech industry’s second highest valued startup (‘or private tech firm’) behind only… Uber. (Of course!) Currently, Didi is ranked fourth, according to data from Crunchbase, but the new round could take its valuation past that of fellow Chinese firms Xiaomi ($45 billion) and Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial ($50 billion) which currently sit second and third, respectively, behind Uber on the valuation ladder.
The source told TechCrunch that some of the investors in Didi’s new round will include existing backers Bank of Communications, China Merchants Bank and SoftBank. Silver Lake Kraftwerk, which recently raised a $15 billion fund — its fifth to date — is set to join as a new investor in the round. The firm counts Didi investor Alibaba, and Alibaba’s local commerce affiliate Koubei among its portfolio of deals.
All of this comes while Didi waits upon the completion of its acquisition of Uber’s China business. The deal was first announced on August 1, but it is subject to numerous regulatory bodies. More recently, Didi has forayed into the U.S. with a California-based research lab dedicated to developing artificial intelligence and self-driving car technology. It even poached a high-profile Uber researcher as part of its U.S. push. It also expanded into focus into Latin America, via a $100 million investment, and it backed one of China’s top bike-sharing companies, Ofo, last year.

345,ChargePoint is ready for flying EVs,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/26/chargepoint-is-ready-for-flying-evs/,2017/04/26,"
Yesterday I wrote about a poll conducted by researchers at the University of Michigan that found people were interested in flying cars if they were autonomous, shared and electric. As soon as I posted that, I found an email in my inbox saying that ChargePoint and Uber Elevate, among others at the recent conference on flying vehicles, had partnered to prepare for just that exact scenario.
ChargePoint announced the Express Plus charging platform at CES 2017, which allows for faster, more powerful charging and modularity. That means that owners of the stations can expand their charging options as they need to — which includes charging electric flying cars. The latest estimates say that it will take a minimum of 300 kW to charge a flying car 25 percent in 5 minutes, or 25-90 percent in 15 minutes. ChargePoint’s Express Plus stations can deliver up to 400 kW per port right now, so operators could add a station for flying vehicles in the future without ripping out infrastructure that’s already in place.
ChargePoint already knows that charging quickly generates a lot of heat, which is why it developed liquid-cooled hoses for its Express Plus stations. But charging a flying vehicle would likely require extended cooling, even around the battery pack itself during fast charging. The vehicle needs to be able to ascend to altitude within about 90 seconds, and the batteries need to be cool enough to take that strain.
ChargePoint’s stations will be able to support vertical takeoff and landing, aka VTOL, which is again exactly what people said they preferred in the University of Michigan poll. The fundamental elements are already in place for charging VTOL vehicles, but the Express Plus stations themselves will need to be redesigned to accommodate them, and the plug and hose will likely need to be redesigned to fit the particulars of the vehicles, whatever that may be.
Why would ChargePoint bother to jump onto a technology bandwagon that seems kind of out there? The answer is that ChargePoint is already developing charging solutions for electric cars, buses and trucks. The company seems to be up for charging anything that needs electricity to move now and in the future — even flying cars.

Uber is looking to get Google co-founder and Alphabet CEO Larry Page to provide a deposition in the ongoing court case between itself and Waymo. The company made the request in court today during a discovery hearing before Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley, and Waymo opposed the request.
The court ended up saying it’ll allow a single question for Page from Uber, about whether a conversation took place between him and Otto co-founder Anthony Levandowski about Levandowski potentially going to Uber ahead of the August announcement regarding the ride-hailing company’s acquisition of Otto. Waymo’s lawyers say this conversation never occurred.
What Uber seems to want to prove is that Page might have been aware that Levandowski took the documents from Google prior to his departure, but didn’t reveal that knowledge during that conversation, or during a subsequent conversation with Uber founder and CEO Travis Kalanick. Uber’s contention seems to be that were the information disclosed during either of these conversations, that throws some cold water on Waymo’s claims that Levandowski’s actions included malicious intent.

Uber seems to be seeking Page’s testimony as a workaround, given that Levandowski has asserted his Fifth Amendment rights and won’t be a source for particulars, including what conversations he may or may not have had with Google’s co-founder prior to the Otto deal going down. Business Insider reports that Uber’s lawyer Arturo Gonzalez told the court on Tuesday that Page was aware Levandowski had downloaded and taken 14,000 Google files prior to his departure.
The court ruled against Levandowski’s Fifth Amendment rights extending to allow redactions of a privilege log revealing legal details between Uber and Levandowski around the outset of their acquisition agreement.
We’ll hear more about whether Waymo will get the preliminary injunction it’s seeking against Uber next week, at a hearing around the request.

349,"If you build a flying car, will they come?",https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/25/if-you-build-a-flying-car-will-they-come/,2017/04/25,"
Flying cars have been a sci-fi promise for decades, and we’re hearing that they may be a reality soon. Maybe. But are consumers really waiting with bated breath for a flying car? Michael Sivak and Brandon Schoettle at the University of Michigan’s Sustainable Worldwide Transportation group surveyed 508 Americans online in April 2017 to find out what people think of this sci-fi dream becoming reality. TL;DR: Yeah, we’re into flying cars.
The respondents were pretty evenly split between male and female, and the age ranges were pretty even from 18 to over 60 years of age. Men were far more likely to be familiar with the idea of flying cars (53 percent versus 78 percent), but about two-thirds of every age group was aware of the concept.
The number-one benefit people imagined for flying cars was shorter travel time, which is a no-brainer. But the people polled were not expecting pie in the sky; more than 8 in 10 were moderately or very concerned about the safety of flying cars. They thought it might not be too hard to learn to use a flying car, with 63 percent being concerned about it. But again, not fools — 75 percent of people wanted a parachute for the vehicle as a whole.
People were very demanding of the technology, however. Most respondents wanted their flying car to plug into the wall to refuel. And nearly half thought a flying car should be able to go about 400 miles before needing to fuel up again, which is more than the range of most modern electric vehicles but a typical range for modern gasoline-powered cars with wheels instead of wings. Not that people wanted wings; they actually preferred the idea of taking off straight up, like a helicopter, rather than needing a runway.
Interestingly, people were a little more interested in a flying autonomous car that would pick them up and take them somewhere rather than having to own, operate and insure their very own flying cars. But if they had to pay for a flying car, most people thought $100,000 to $200,000 seemed reasonable, which is the price of many luxury and super cars.
So, manufacturers, just build shared autonomous electric flying cars with parachutes for less than the price of a new Bentley Continental GT. We’re waiting.

Anthony Levandowski, the engineer at the center of the legal battle between Google and Uber over driverless-car technology, has suffered a setback. Levandowski has broadly invoked his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination in the case, refusing to answer questions about whether or not he downloaded confidential files from Google before quitting his job at the company to join Uber’s self-driving car team. However, an appeals court has denied his request to extend his Fifth Amendment rights so broadly that Uber could redact documents on Levandowski’s behalf.
Google’s self-driving unit, Waymo, is suing Uber, claiming that it acquired Levandowski’s company Otto as a way to steal Waymo’s secret lidar technology and speed up its efforts to bring the first self-driving car to market. Waymo has claimed that Levandowski signed an agreement with Uber’s lawyers just a few days after quitting his job at Google, requiring Uber to defend him if the company’s acquisition of Otto resulted in a lawsuit. Waymo has accordingly asked Uber to hand over a privilege log with details about Uber’s early legal entanglement with Levandowski.
But Levandowski opposed the production of an unredacted privilege log, saying that if Uber produced it, it would violate his Fifth Amendment rights. An appeals court disagreed today, ordering Uber to produce the complete log without redactions.
“Mr. Levandowski argues that he is entitled to relief under the Fifth Amendment because production of the unredacted privilege log could potentially incriminate him. We are not persuaded that the district court erred in its ruling requiring defendants to produce an unredacted privilege log,” the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled.
The order also opens the door for Waymo to request a copy of the due diligence report that Uber commissioned while it was in the process of acquiring Otto. Waymo has claimed that the due diligence report could contain evidence that Uber knew Otto was using stolen technology. Uber, on the other hand, has claimed that none of Waymo’s confidential files were uploaded to an Uber computer and therefore were never used in the development of its lidar system.
Waymo and Uber declined to comment on the appeals court ruling.
The two companies are due back in court on May 3, when a judge will decide whether or not to issue a preliminary injunction that could prevent Levandowski from continuing to work on Uber’s self-driving program or even halt Uber’s self-driving efforts altogether until the lawsuit is resolved.

Mobileye’s Road Experience Management (REM) platform scored another big win today: Signing up Nissan, the third major automaker to enter an agreement with the company to help build and use its high-precision road maps, which are updated in real time using anonymized, crowdsourced data from cars on the road.
Nissan joins BMW and Volkswagen as REM platform members, and will both use the Global RoadBook maps that result from Mobileye’s system to help its own vehicles navigate and to add redundancy to its forthcoming autonomous driving software. Nissan vehicles will also help contribute to the pool of collective crowdsourced data, which is big for REM because the more vehicles participating, the better the quality of the real-time data that updates the maps across the fleet as soon as changes happen on the road.
Nissan had already been working with Mobileye and REM, with a pilot that extended into Nissan’s London-based self-driving tech demonstrations. REM isn’t the only collab between the two companies, either – Nissan uses Mobileye tech in its ProPILOT ADAS system, for instance.
Mobileye and future owner Intel must be even happier about this new deal, however – with each new automaker that sings up for REM, the platform becomes an even more attractive component for other car companies, and approaches the status of ‘industry standard’ for autonomous vehicle operation.

Waymo isn’t the only self-driving company with on-demand autonomous car service news today: Dutch startup Amber Mobility, which designed a new vehicle specifically for shared commuter use, is putting a firm timeline on its plans to add self-driving capabilities to its fleet.
Amber will provide self-driving vehicles for users with its business-to-business car sharing platform in Eindhoven in the Netherlands by midyear 2018, the company says, with a goal of expanding deployment rapidly from that to its other Dutch markets, including Helmond, and then to the rest of Europe after that.
Amber Mobility is a very young company, which revealed its Amber One car design last year and business model. The company is starting out with standard electric vehicles and testing among a small group of corporate clients, however, and the autonomous features will be rolled out first with that first beta pool.
The young company has some big competition, as mentioned – Waymo is piloting its own self-driving service in Phoenix, with applications open to all residents to sign up to ride as of this morning.
Amber has strong partners, however, including support from local government, TomTom for maps, Nvidia for image and sensor data processing, and Microsoft for use of Azure and AI software. The Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) is also participating, lending its big brains to help fill in the autonomous vehicle software part of the picture.

Waymo has already been offering members of the public access to its self-driving fleet – for two months, during a limited trial in Phoenix, Arizona. The Alphabet-owned company quietly kicked off public availability of its Fiat-Chrysler Pacifica minivans and other autonomous vehicles, equipped with self-driving hardware and software, with a small group of testers who live in the Phoenix area, giving them an autonomous way to move around the city.
The Waymo trial is now expanding, with an open application available to members of the pubic living in Phoenix. Waymo is looking to expand the pool, and the application is open to anyone living in Phoenix. Waymo released a video featuring one of its first testing family, who sum up the surprise we likely mostly feel – Waymo’s self-driving service isn’t just ‘coming soon,’ it’s actually providing practical service for people right now.
Waymo’s short video also highlights another important aspect of this program – a focus on people and acclimatization to the tech, rather than on the tech and vehicles themselves. The family featured shares some of the reasons they like the service, and they’re incredibly mundane – for the father, Ted, it’s mainly about removing a big stressor in the form of the morning commute, and for the mother, Candace, it’s about making it possible to get the mostly teenage kids where they want to go without having to micromanage the vehicle schedule.

Waymo also announced that it’s going to be deploying 500 more Pacifica Hybrid vehicles in its self-driving fleet, adding to the existing 100 that it’s already been putting on real roads since the start of this year. That represents a lot of new miles to be driven cumulatively by Waymo, which already has nearly a decade of self-driving experience under its belt thanks to its beginnings as Google’s self-driving car project.
The big news, here, however, is that Waymo has essentially leapfrogged Uber in its self-driving testing; the technology was already much more reliable in practice (I’ve ridden in self-driving vehicles from both), but now Waymo is offering a service that is, as Waymo CEO John Krafcik describes it in a blog post, providing access to a fleet that’s on call “every day, at any time, to go anywhere within an area that’s about twice the size of San Francisco.”
If you’re interested, Waymo is accepting applications here. Having driven around in one of their vehicles, I can safely say I’d be applying to join up myself if I was Phoenix-based.

Mercedes-Benz started testing out a new car sharing service in December of last year, debuting Croove in a limited pilot allowing people to rent out their cars on-demand for short stints in Munich. The program has proven successful enough for Mercedes to expand it to other German cities, including Berlin, where it began operations in mid-April.
The Daimler-owned car brand’s program is very similar to competitors like Turo, since it connects users with vehicles owned by private individuals, rather than giving them access to vehicles owned by a single fleet operator, like Daimler’s other car sharing venture car2go, which offers short-term, one-way rentals of Smart cars and select Mercedes-Benz vehicles.
Croove’s peer-to-peer model means you get a relatively spread out selection of pick-up points to choose from, though you have to return the vehicle to its origin. There’s also a paid delivery option, if you want the car to come to you, and while the service currently relies on a key hand-off, Daimler plans to eventually introduce keyless entry options to Croove. The service lets users set their own price, or trust Croove’s discretion to establish a fair rate, taking into account supply and demand. Croove is also open to all vehicle makes and models.
The Croove experiment was a product of Mercedes-Benz’s CASE unit, which is basically a skunkworks for connected, autonomous, mobility services and electric technology projects. Its expansion to other German metropolitan areas in effect signifies its graduation to a proper company, which should mean it’ll its budget and product develop efforts grow considerably as well.
Among major car brands, Daimler’s exploration of mobility services might be the most far-ranging. Car2go was early relative to many of its big brand peers, and the German company also acquires stakes in both myTaxi and Hailo before combining the companies into one ride-hailing endeavor.

355,"Tesla to double its Supercharger network in 2017, topping 10K chargers globally",https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/24/tesla-to-double-its-supercharger-network-in-2017-topping-10k-chargers-globally/,2017/04/24,"
Tesla is getting ready to produce the Model 3 at volumes unprecedented for the company, but it hasn’t forgotten about that other key ingredient in the electric vehicle mix – charging infrastructure. The automaker announced today that while it began 2017 with over 5,000 Superchargers installed globally, it will end the year with double that, offering 10,000 Supercharger connections worldwide.
The Destination charging connectors, which are commercial equivalents of the high-capacity home chargers EV owners install in their garage, will also get a boost, from over 9,000 installations today, to over 15,000 by end of year. In total in North America, the number of Superchargers will increase 150 percent, and EV-loving California will get over 1,000 new Superchargers during 2017 within the state alone.
Tesla’s global doubling of the Supercharger network in 2017 represents an exponential acceleration of its expansion; the Supercharger program launched in 2012, meaning it’s taken five full years to get to the 5,000 charger milestone. The expansion also includes increasing capacity at existing sites, adding more in dense areas like urban centers, and generally trying to eliminate and alleviate existing and expected wait times for drivers.
In the end the Tesla infrastructure push will be much-needed, since the additional demand brought about by a Model 3 vehicle population that could swell by as many as 500,000 units per year (if Tesla meets its ambitious production goals) will come with an equivalent spike in charging location demand. And since most Model 3s will likely have lower top range capacity when compared to Model S and X vehicles, demand could spike further still.

356,Tesla’s Model 3 production plans said to include a risky manufacturing move,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/24/teslas-model-3-production-plans-said-to-include-a-risky-manufacturing-move/,2017/04/24,"
Tesla’s making a bet on its production process for the Model 3 that defies accepted industry know-how – which is not at all an unusual strategy for the young carmaker. Basically all of Tesla’s success thus far has been due to its ability to defy accepted industry wisdom, but with the Model 3 production line, the risk centers around skipping a step in the manufacturing process of a new vehicle that could lead to greater expense down the road.
Typically, automakers start the production of a new model using prototype tooling and machinery (called ‘soft tooling’) that’s designed to help get the fit, finish and tolerances right on new vehicle parts, which are then scrapped and replaced with more expensive, permanent units once the process has been established and configured correctly, Reuters reports. Tesla is skipping that step and going right to purchasing permanent, pricey production equipment to help it meet its own timeline of spinning up full-scale production of the Model 3 in time for fall.
This could be risky because any changes required will have to be made on the more expensive permanent machines, instead of on essentially disposable prototypes designed for use in iterating on the process early while working out the kinks. The Model 3’s projected sales volume, which easily dwarfs current production numbers of the Model S and Model X, further complicates things by introducing more opportunity for even small errors to result in recalls. Tesla just issued a voluntary recall for 53,000 Model S and X units built in 2016 due to a non-threatening parking brake problem, and at scales where you’re producing up to 500,000 cars per year, that kind of issue balloons bigger.
If, however, Tesla skips this step and all goes well, it could recoup considerable cost and time savings by going right to final production equipment, and Tesla apparently had only bad experiences from soft tooling the Model X at its launch in 2015. Reuters also notes that Audi tried something similar with a new plant in Mexico recently, and this saved the plant around 30 percent of its usual spin-up time.
Going against accepted wisdom is basically how Tesla, and all of Elon Musk’s businesses, have been founded and how they continue to thrive. This Model 3 move may present risk, but it also presents considerable upside if it proves successful.

357,Apple testing process for autonomous safety drivers revealed in DMV documents,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/21/apple-testing-process-for-autonomous-safety-drivers-revealed-in-dmv-documents/,2017/04/21,"
Apple has developed a testing procedure for drivers who would act as failsafe controls during autonomous vehicle testing, documents discovered by Business Insider via a public records request show. The documents detail the testing procedure that Apple has created in order to comply with the California Department of Motor Vehicle’s rules regarding autonomous testing on state roads.
Business Insider’s report on the documents detail the development platform being used by Apple in its testing, which include sensor hardware and software for monitoring surroundings, and which are called the “Apple Automated System.” It can control steering, acceleration, deceleration and “portions of the dynamic driving task,” according to forms filled out by Apple officials. So basically, it’s like any other autonomous driving tech in development.
The documents also reveal that cars used for testing include steering equipment culled from consumer gaming controller equipment (Logitech wheel and pedals, specifically) to provide them with the means to take over control of the vehicle. Driver proficiency with identifying the need to take over, as well as their actual ability to take action, are then tested using seven different tests, which is Apple’s way of fulfilling a requirement dictated by California law that safety drivers be tested prior to deploying test vehicles on the road.
These documents don’t shed much in the way of new light on Apple’s plans for autonomous driving – the company was previously granted a license by the California DMV to conduct autonomous testing, a process which includes public listing of the company name on a list on the DMV’s website. Apple’s permit covers three 2015 Lexus RX450h SUVs, which is the car that Google has been using for its own self-driving tests, as well as six drivers.
The scope of the project and the details of the testing and development system don’t reveal much about Apple’s ambitions or strategy in this market. Others on the California DMV’s list include startups, suppliers and companies still in stealth, at various stages of the development process. For Apple, this could easily be an experimentation that never results in any kind of product – a step up from filing a patent application, essentially, but still galaxies removed from, say, reports that production lines are spinning up for the next iPhone.
Still, the documentation provides some more substance to the initial DMV license grant, and strongly suggests that keeping a close eye on the DMV’s next public release of its disengagement reports from vehicle testers is a good idea.

358,Waymo accuses Uber of hiding a secret LiDAR device,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/21/waymo-accuses-uber-of-hiding-a-secret-lidar-device/,2017/04/21,"
In preparation for a preliminary injunction hearing next month, Waymo today filed new claims in its lawsuit against Uber, alleging that its competitor withheld information about technology Uber is using in its development of self-driving cars. Waymo is in the midst of a contentious lawsuit against Uber, in which it claims Anthony Levandowski, a former Google employee, stole confidential material and used it to jumpstart Uber’s self-driving program.
Uber claimed earlier this month that its LiDAR system, code-named Fuji, isn’t ready and therefore isn’t being used in its self-driving cars, which rely instead on commercial systems furnished by Velodyne. Waymo now says that Uber worked on a second system that more closely copies Waymo’s designs (Waymo’s LiDAR relies on a single-lens system, while the Fuji is multi-lens).
Waymo also claims Uber participated in a “cover up” to keep its second, un-named design hidden from the court. “They were hiding a device,” Waymo’s lawyers said.
A spokesperson for Uber told TechCrunch that this second system was never developed into a fully-realized prototype and amounted only to a few unassembled parts. These parts were shown to Waymo, Uber said.
Waymo apparently learned of the second device during an Uber employee’s deposition on April 13. Asheem Linaval, an electrical engineer at Uber who previously worked for Google and for Levandowski’s early self-driving company 510 Systems, told lawyers during the deposition that he worked on two LiDAR systems for Otto — Fuji and another system.
“It is a LiDAR that we wanted to — it was a prototype LiDAR,” Linaval said of the other system, the name of which is redacted in court filings. That and Fuji “were our only two internal LiDAR designs,” he added.

Waymo, the self-driving car company owned by Google parent company Alphabet, sued Uber in February for patent infringement and theft of trade secrets. Waymo claims that its former employee Levandowski downloaded 14,000 confidential files before leaving to launch the self-driving truck company Otto, which was acquired by Uber mere months after it debuted. Waymo argues that the 14,000 documents are being used to develop Uber’s self-driving technology, while Uber contends that the files never made it onto its servers. As for Levandowski, he’s asserted his Fifth Amendment rights broadly and hasn’t publicly addressed the allegations of theft.

359,Uber will live stream its first Elevate VTOL summit April 25-27,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/20/uber-will-live-stream-its-first-elevate-vtol-summit-april-25-27/,2017/04/20,"
Uber has been tinkering with the idea of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) craft for a while now, beginning with the release of a white paper late last year detailing what steps it thinks are required to help it get it get to the point where it might make sense to actually field an on-demand airborne ride hailing service. It announced that it would host an industry summit of people working on making VTOLs affordable and available at the time, and the first iteration of that conference is happening next week, with a live stream available for remote viewing.
Uber doesn’t really want to build flying cars, but it wants to take advantage of them to expand its service offerings and potentially do a bit more to solve the growing problem on city traffic congestion. The Elevate Summit, which it’s hosting in Dallas, Texas April 25 through the 27, is designed to bring together some of the people who might actually be building the cars, and the technology infrastructure required to make it happen.
The website for Uber’s Elevate Summit details some of what’s going to happen at the meeting of minds, which will feature participants from the manufacturing, regulatory, aviation and venture capital industries. Uber has said it wants to help encourage all aspects of the development of affordable, practical, electric VTOL transportation options for use within dense urban environments, so it makes sense to throw all the ingredients in the pot and hope that the result is a delicious flying car stew.
Some of the people speaking during the event include Uber’s own CPO Jeff Holden, along with Ross Perot Jr., Embraer CEO Paulo de Cesar de Souza e Silva, Lilium co-founder and CEO Daniel Wiegand, Airbus A3’s head of autonomous systems Arne Soschek, the governor of Wyoming and many more. There’s a lot of VIP speaker slots Uber is still keeping under wraps, too, so I have to expect a fair number of celebrity astronauts or something.
Uber has a lot going on at the moment in terms of corporate culture crises, legal trouble and executive scrutiny, but it’s still going forward with an effort to kickstart progress on flying cars. Maybe this is how the people putting together those Popular Science covers in the 50s and 60s felt, but I’m increasingly feeling optimism around the possibility of actually experiencing flying cars within my lifetime.

360,Tesla voluntarily recalls around 53K 2016 Model S and Model X vehicles,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/20/tesla-voluntarily-recalls-around-53k-2016-model-s-and-model-x-vehicles/,2017/04/20,"
Tesla is issuing a voluntary recall for Model S and Model X vehicles made between February 2016 and October 2016, for a potential manufacturing issue in which the parking brake, once engaged, might experience a fractured internal gear that results in it being stuck in the ‘on’ position.
Tesla stresses that this recall is being done only because the carmaker typically exercises an abundance of caution in these cases, and that only a small number of vehicles will likely ever exhibit the issue, and that even when they do, the resulting problems don’t present a safety risk to either drivers or passengers.
The problem came to light because Tesla found customers were getting alerts that said their parking brake needs service, or that the brake could not be disengaged, not in huge numbers but with noteworthy frequency. Tesla traced the problem back to a batch of brakes from supplier Brembo installed on cars made during the roughly ten month period covered by the recall.
That amounts to around 53,000 vehicles in total, distributed to customers globally, but Tesla says that under 5 percent – perhaps even as low as 2 percent – of those cars actually have the problem. Still, it is opting to recall them all to avoid any potential issues since it’s hard to easily tell which gears are affected and which are not. Parts will be swapped in every case, as a result, and the recall ultimately affects more than half the cars Tesla produced in 2016, per its own financial results.
Tesla will be filing the recall with NHTSA, and expects to have all parts needed to make the swap by October of this year. The process takes less than 45 minutes to replace both of the parts on each brake on the vehicle, but because of availability of replacement parts, the carmaker will be starting the recall process now and complete a total recall by October, assuming all 53,000 vehicles affected come back for service.
Here’s the full email being sent out to Tesla customers this morning describing the problem, and the steps owners can take to get it fixed:

Tesla recently discovered a potential manufacturing issue with the electric parking brakes installed on certain Model S and Model X vehicles that could prevent the parking brake from releasing. We do not believe this issue could ever lead to a safety concern for our customers, and we have not seen a single accident or injury relating to it. However, in order to be overly cautious, we are going to be proactively replacing these parts to ensure that no issues arise.

Specifically, we have determined that the electric parking brakes installed on Model S and Model X vehicles built between February and October 2016 may contain a small gear that could have been manufactured improperly by our third‑party supplier. If this gear were to break, the parking brake would continue to keep the car from moving, but the parking brake would then be stuck in place. There have been no reports of the parking brake system failing to hold a parked vehicle or failing to stop a vehicle in an emergency as a result of this condition, and this part has no impact on the car’s regular braking systems. We have also determined that only a very small percentage of gears in vehicles built during this period were manufactured improperly.

Our records show that you own a Tesla vehicle that was built during this period. We will soon be sending you an official recall notice by mail, which will include information on how to have your parking brakes replaced. In the meantime, it is safe to continue regular use of your vehicle.

Thank you for being a Tesla customer. For more information, FAQs, and other details related to this recall, please visit the Recall Information page.

361,Watch Lilium’s successful test flight of the world’s first electric VTOL jet,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/20/watch-liliums-successful-test-flight-of-the-worlds-first-electric-vtol-jet/,2017/04/20,"

Lilium has successfully tested its all-electric vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) jet for the first time, and you can watch the inaugural test flight above. The basic concept of a VTOL is that it has the benefits of a helicopter in terms of taking off without requiring a huge runway, but once airborne, it can still achieve the higher top speeds of a fixed wing aircraft like a jet.
The Lilium Jet actually completed a series of tests (the condensed version is above), using this two-seat prototype of the larger craft it eventually hopes to create. Lilium also marked the occasion by announcing a new 5-seater design, which it envisions will be used for on-demand flying taxi and ride-sharing services in the future. They’re promising us flying cars, in effect.

Lilium’s 100-percent renewable electric power is its key defining trait; plenty of others are looking at VTOL tech, but many, including DARPA, are using a hybrid fuel approach to work around some of the design and performance challenges of relying solely on electric.
The jet is unique in its use of electric power for both the vertical take-off, and the jet-powered components of its engine system, and Lilium believes this is a key ingredient in terms of making a sustainable vehicle that people will actually use in cities, thanks to its minimal ecological impact.

Using jet-powered flight once the craft is airborne also has big benefits in terms of energy economy once you’re cruising through the air; Lilium says that it can get a range of around 186 miles from its battery and a top speed of about 186 mph, too, which is much more than what you’d get out of a large rotor-only vehicle with similar battery capacity.
To illustrate in real terms what kind of benefits the Lilium Jet could bring to urban transit times, the company provides the example of getting from Manhattan to JFK airport: a trip that’s usually just south of an hour by car would take about 5 minutes using the Lilium Jet. Yeah.
Normally I’m not easily taken in by promises of airborne commutes, but Lilium’s successful test flight video does have my hopes flying aflutter.

362,Getaround raises $45M from Toyota and others to build more partnerships,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/20/getaround-raises-45m-from-toyota-and-others-to-build-more-partnerships/,2017/04/20,"
Car sharing service Getaround has raised $45 million in Series C funding, led by a new investor Braemar Energy Ventures, and with participation from Toyota Motor Corp and China’s SAIC Motor. The round also includes existing investors Menlo Ventures and Triangle Peak Partners, and is all about helping Getaround continue its new strategy of partnering with big transportation players globally, with an eye towards eventually making it easy for people to gain instant access to self-driving vehicles wherever they are.
Getaround has been doing a lot of partnering lately – the company just recently announced a deal with Uber that will allow drivers to easily pick up one of its fleet parked around San Francisco and do some Uber pick-ups. It also partnered with Toyota in October (which is when it first revealed the automaker was making a strategic investment in the company, too). The carmaker is building Getaround incentives into its lease agreements, as a way to help offer the cost of ownership by making it easy for vehicle owners to put money from renting their vehicle on Getaround directly towards lease payments.
Getaround also has a partnership in place with Mercedes-Benz, including payment rebates when new vehicle owners also rent their cars on the platform. Getaround wants to make this kind of thing much more broadly available across carmaker partners, with technology that makes rentals possible built-in to cars as they roll of the assembly lines, and it hopes this funding will help it get there.
You can see how that would enable a future where it would be easy to find and access autonomous vehicles. Getaround seems focused now on providing the software and hardware integration layer that will make that possible once the autonomous tech is in place, and in the meantime, it offers an interesting way for carmakers to reduce ownership costs and potentially defray some of the gradual declines we’ve seen in that part of the industry.

At the Shanghai Auto Show on this week, global automotive supplier Harman announced a new partnership with Baidu, the leading Chinese internet services provider. The team-up brings together Samsung-owned Harman’s extensive reach among automakers, and existing expertise in-car infotainment systems, with Baidu’s leading role in China’s AI software economy.
Baidu will develop cloud-based AI solutions for use in cars in partnership with Harman, across efforts that include building Baidu’s DuerOS voice-based personal assistant into cars. DuerOS is a bit like an Alexa for the Chinese market, with an open platform that’s accessible to makers of many categories of consumer devices, including speakers, TVs, phones and more. With Harman, Baidu will focus on tailoring DuerOS for automotive use cases, with speech recognition and natural language process capabilities in both English and Mandarin.
Harman and Baidu previously teamed up to launch a solution called CarLife that offers networked, Internet-based features accessible via networked in-car infotainment systems. And the partnership sounds like it’ll only grow closer from here: The work both companies are doing in the car with DuerOS is expected to eventually make its way back to smart speakers, another area where Harman is a global international powerhouse.

Flying-car company AeroMobil revealed its new model today, and is set to start taking pre-orders for the limited first edition run of the hybrid vehicle. The company had promised to offer a commercially available flying car in 2017, and this somewhat makes good on that promise, though pre-orders placed now won’t ship until 2020, since AeroMobil expects to ramp up to full production over the next few years and deliver starting then.
The AeroMobil does sound impressive on paper, however: It transforms from car mode to air in less than 3 minutes. It has around 434 miles of driving range, too, or around 466 miles of flight range operating at 75 percent of its maximum speed. Top ground speed for the AeroMobil car-plane is around 100 mph, while it can do around 224 mph while gunning it during flight.
AeroMobil is more emphatic about safety than speed, however — the vehicle has a lot of features designed to make sure it can withstand even choppy flying weather. There’s a parachute for emergency landings that will help the car float back to earth, and airbags are designed to help out in both terrestrial and airborne crashes.
It all sounds very cool, and plucked from a Bond film, obviously. This model was helped along by the $3.2 million in cash it raised from supply partner Patrick Hessel, and was unveiled for the first time today at Monaco’s ultra-fancy Top Marques auto show.
The price tag is fancy, too: The car starts at $1.3 million, so you’re not going to see a lot of these in neighborhood driveways.

365,Texas gets closer to allowing self-driving vehicle testing on public roads,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/19/texas-gets-closer-to-allowing-self-driving-vehicle-testing-on-public-roads/,2017/04/19,"
A new state might join the ranks of those that allow testing of autonomous vehicles on public roads: A bill just passed the Texas Senate Transportation Committee that spells out a path toward statutes allowing use of highly automated vehicles on public state roads. The legislation has already been composed and vetted by public safety interests, as well as private and public stakeholders, and this moves it one step closer to becoming law, pending Senate debate and referral to the House.
The bill, “SB 2205” to its friends, was introduced by Senator Kelly Hancock, who also is the chair of the Senate Business & Commerce committee, and it’s definitely intended to help make sure that Texas can attract investment and economic boosts from companies seeking to build autonomous vehicles and self-driving software. Texas is likely eyeing nearby Arizona covetously, as that state plays host to self-driving vehicle tests from GM’s Cruise, Alphabet’s Waymo and Uber.
Texas’ bill would allow tests of cars that comply with any and all applicable federal laws, provided they’re also registered by the Texas DMV and have an on-board recorder to track data in case of incidents. It also requires that testers inform relevant state agencies ahead of time regarding the time and place where testing will occur, and that it be insured and display signs indicating it’s an autonomous car.
Like other states, Texas requires regular summaries of data resulting from tests be submitted both to its own Department of Transportation and to NHTSA.
Other states are likewise looking to encourage self-driving testing and operation, and in December Michigan lawmakers passed some of the most permissive laws around operation of autonomous vehicles, setting up a framework for not just testing but eventual vehicle sales, too.
Driving behavior seldom restrains itself to strictly within state borders, so it’s a good thing for the industry at large that more states are warming up to allowing autonomous tech on their roads.

366,Tesla settles lawsuit against ex-Autopilot lead’s self-driving startup Aurora,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/19/tesla-settles-lawsuit-against-ex-autopilot-leads-self-driving-startup-aurora/,2017/04/19,"
Tesla has settled a lawsuit it filed against Sterling Anderson, a former employee and past director of Autopilot. Anderson was a key leader of Tesla’s semi-automated highway driving features, prior to leaving the company to found his own self-driving startup, Aurora, along with former Google self-driving car project CTO Chris Urmson.
The settlement clears Aurora and Anderson of wrongdoing, and includes a one-time “reimbursement” payment of $100,000 from the startup to Tesla. Tesla had accused Aurora and Anderson of poaching Tesla employees for the new venture, and the settlement also includes a provision whereby Aurora agreed not to actively pursue luring anyone away from Tesla, either full-time employees or contractors, until at least next February.
Tesla will also be conducting an “audit” of Aurora devices and material, run by a neutral third-party, to ensure no Tesla confidential info resides on Aurora-related devices and accounts.
This is actually a lot of what Tesla was looking for from an ultimate ruling in the case, per their original filing against Anderson, Aurora and Urmson. Tesla provided, through a spokesperson, the following statement to TechCrunch regarding the settlement:
Tesla’s lawsuit against Mr. Anderson, Mr. Urmson, and Aurora has been settled. Under the settlement, Mr. Anderson’s contractual obligations to Tesla will remain in place and will also be extended to Aurora, with additional specific protections being added to ensure there are no further violations. The settlement also establishes a process to allow Tesla to recover all of the proprietary information that was taken from the company, and it provides for Aurora’s computer systems to be subject to ongoing audits to monitor for any improper retention or use of Tesla’s property. Finally, $100,000 was paid to Tesla.
Sterling Anderson provided TechCrunch with this short emailed statement, but also wrote up his thoughts on what this means for his company and self-driving tech in general on Medium:


We started Aurora to accelerate the industry. Frivolous lawsuits only slow it down. Today, less than three months after filing (and before we were permitted to file a response) Tesla has withdrawn their claims, without damages, without attorney’s fees, and without any finding of wrongdoing. We have even agreed to reimburse the cost of a future audit to demonstrate the integrity of Aurora’s intellectual property.


Anderson’s note offers additional context regarding that $100,000 payment made by Aurora to Tesla: It covers the cost of a forensic audit, which Anderson is clearly very confident Aurora and its employees will easily pass.

More and more devices, from smart dash cams to head-up displays to Bluetooth-enabled diagnostics dongles, are looking to tap your car’s built-in diagnostic (or OBD-II) port for power and data.
The problem: this port… really wasn’t built to be used like that. Primarily designed to be tapped occasionally to better explain that oh-so-vague “Check Engine” light, it certainly wasn’t built to be connected to an always-attached device blasting out all sorts of different wireless protocols whenever the vehicle is on.
Example A: Researchers at Argus Security have found a flaw in a commercially available Bluetooth-enabled diagnostics dongle that let them turn off the vehicle’s engine while the car was moving, as long as they were within Bluetooth range.
The dongle in question is the Bosch Drivelog Connect, a device meant to shed insight on your driving behaviors and send diagnostic information to a companion smartphone app via Bluetooth. To Bosch’s credit, the company began addressing the issue within a day of being alerted, and publicly acknowledged and outlined their fix for the issue here.
“Who cares? I’ve never even heard of that device,” you might say.
It’s a fair stance, but one that assumes that this is the only device that has this sort of flaw. Similar flaws have been found in other devices. Meanwhile, more gadgets are tapping the OBD-II port than ever — I see a new one hit my inbox every few weeks. Many of the ones I check out have obvious user-facing bugs… so it’s probably safe to assume that all the workings behind the scenes aren’t exactly flawless.
So do you need to go rip that shiny new dash cam or smart display out of your car? Probably not — but be mindful of the attack vector you’re introducing to the 4,000-pound metal box you’re cruising around in. It’s the owner’s responsibility to stay up to date on reports regarding the device’s security, and to keep the device itself up to date (a lot of these things are easy to set up and then completely forget).
More crucially, it’s up to the device makers to test the hell out of their devices, hire external firms to try to crack them and patch bugs as quickly as they responsibly can. Consider building a “red alert” notice/mandatory update into apps for the worst stuff.
If you’re interested in the specifics of the research on the aforementioned dongle, Argus has a deep breakdown of their methodology here, from disassembling the companion app, to poking holes in the device’s security, to actually shutting down one of their own vehicles while it was in motion.

Cruise has a new release in its video series of drives completed by its autonomous test vehicles in San Francisco. If you’ve lived in the city, you’ve likely seen one of these by now – the white Chevrolet Bolt EVs stand out, especially with their autonomous sensor suite. The vehicles are running their routes mostly in autonomous mode, racking up driverless miles driven and helping GM-owned Cruise improve its tech over time.
This new video is the third in Cruise’s series of videos that the company has released in which it shows a continuous chunk of unbroken autonomous driving time. This instalment focuses on a night-time ride through San Francisco, and covers an entire hour of driving. You won’t actually have to sit and watch for an entire hour, however; the video above is sped up 4x, and the one below is running at 10x regular speed, but both depict the entire hour in a continuous cut. One noteworthy moment you probably want to check out happens at the 6:20 mark in the video above.
The car basically covered the eastern half of San Francisco during its route, Cruise tells me, from SOMA, through downtown and across Nob Hill. Cruise’s tech is clearly growing in competence over time, and night driving is an especially challenging needle to thread for self-driving cars.

GM recently filed documents indicating plans to deploy as many as 300 vehicles across the country, including in Detroit, San Francisco, and Scottsdale, Arizona. Cruise already gets vehicles in those areas, and said last September that it had around 30 vehicles in its test pool at the time.

Uber has a new shareholder very different from its usual institutional backers: Axel Springer, the German media company that owns Business Insider, and Germany’s largest newspaper Bild, among other publications. Neither Uber nor the media giant are getting specific about how much money was invested, or exactly when, but Axel Springer did clarify to German tech news site t3n.de (via Handselblatt) that the nature of the investment wasn’t strategic – this was strictly a financial deal, as any traditional VC would make.
This isn’t the only investment of this type that Axel Springer has made in technology companies: It announced a stake in AirBnB in 2012, which was termed at the time as “very minor” in size. The Uber investment is thought to be along similar lines, according to the t3n.de report. A Springer spokesperson told The Wall Street Journal’s Friedrich Geiger that the amount was “minimal,” and also noted that the publishing company has actually made early-stage investments in around 100 companies.
Obviously, a publisher owning a stake in companies which will be covered within its publication is bound to raise eyebrows, which is likely why Axel Springer is downplaying the size of the stake, and bringing up its other similar financial arrangements. Of course, our parent company is apparently looking to merge with gigantic companies we cover all the time to form a monolithic media megacorporation, so what can you do.
We’re looking to track down the specific size of the Axel Springer stake in the ride hailing company, and will get back to you when we find out more.

The Toyota Mirai fuel-cell electric vehicle is so far a niche vehicle, but that hasn’t stopped Toyota from dreaming big — really big. Project Portal is a proof of concept semi truck that runs on a scaled-up version of the Mirai’s powertrain.
The Mirai is an four-door car, though, with a maximum weight of two tons. The proof of concept vehicle needs to haul 80,000 pounds, the combined gross vehicle weight of a big rig. So how many times do you have to scale the Mirai system to create that kind of power? Twice, according to Tak Yakoo, a senior executive engineer at Toyota.
“A semi is 36 tons, 18 times the size of a Mirai,” Yakoo said in a phone interview. “But we only use twice as much fuel cell and a relatively small battery.” The battery modules are flexible, so you can add more for a huge truck or fewer for a little passenger car or SUV. The scalability of the Mirai system is the point of the exercise, Yakoo said.
“Cars have so many different sizes of engines — 1.4L, 2.0L, 3.5L, etc.,” Yakoo said. “This is one standard fuel cell system with only a change of battery module size. That’s the dramatic change.” The system in the vehicle shown today at the Port of Los Angeles creates 670 hp and 1,325 lb-ft of torque, enough to move a full tractor-trailer and keep it moving down the highway.
For this concept, the engineers simply removed the components related to the diesel drive train and replaced them with the hydrogen fuel cell system. Taking out the diesel engine “leaves a huge space,” Yakoo said with a laugh. “Using that, we brought in the power electric controlling system, the fuel cells, the electric motor, and the fuel tank.” The tank did have to be fitted behind the cab for this demonstration vehicle.
This is only the beginning of Project Portal, a feasibility study in the use of zero-emissions vehicles for heavy duty. Toyota will begin working on the study along with the Port of Los Angeles’s Clean Air Action Plan this summer.
Toyota isn’t the only company working on emissions-free long-haul trucks. Nikola Motor Company has the Nikola One concept, and Elon Musk announced via tweet that Tesla will introduce a heavy-duty truck later this year.
It’s a tough nut to crack, though. “There are many unknown engineering things we need to explore,” Yakoo said. “We may not even know what is the sticking point or bottleneck” in these early stages of the project. “We are sure right now that I am seeing a fuel cell truck moving with 80,000 pounds of freight.”
Toyota’s overall goal is to produce one fuel cell system to rule them all, no matter the size. As Yakoo said at the end of our interview, “Scalability. That’s our dream — and my dream — to make it happen.”

371,Baidu is making its self-driving car platform freely available to the automotive industry,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/18/baidu-project-apollo/,2017/04/18,"
Baidu is opening its self-driving vehicle platform in a bid to help drive the development of autonomous cars.
The Chinese internet giant today announced its Apollo project that will see its platform, including vehicle platform, hardware platform, software platform and cloud data services, opened to help others in the industry, particularly car manufacturers, to develop autonomous vehicles.
The initial target is to open the technologies up for vehicles in restricted environments this July. Baidu said it then plans to share technology for simple urban road conditions before the end of the year, with the ultimate goal of opening its full tech stack — covering fully autonomous driving capabilities on highways and open city roads — by 2020.
“AI has great potential to drive social development, and one of AI’s biggest opportunities is intelligent vehicles,” Qi Lu, the former Microsoft exec who recently became Baidu group president and COO, said in a statement.
Beyond offering up its platform and technologies, which the company has invested significant sums into, Baidu said it is also looking to add partners to the program to strengthen it, particularly around compatible vehicles, sensors, and other components. Baidu has partnerships with Chinese companies such as BAIC Motor, BYD and Chery, while a two-year relationship with BMW petered out last year over apparent differences in strategy.
This move to open source much of its self-driving tech seems like a move to gain a leg-up on more developed competitors such as Google and Tesla.
Baidu was one of the first major tech companies to embrace artificial intelligence and machine learning, and its autonomous vehicle push began with road testing in Beijing in 2015. Last November, it offered test rides to attendees of the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, and the Chinese company also has a permit to test in California, which is where its research labs — including its AI division — is based. Baidu recently lost the head of that project, renowned AI expert Andrew Ng, after he announced the end of his three-year stay at the company, but its AI group nevertheless employs around 1,300 people, with 300 of those in the Baidu Research division. That makes it one of the largest units of its kind in tech.

372,Volkswagen’s I.D. CROZZ electric concept aims for 2020 production,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/18/volkswagens-i-d-crozz-electric-concept-aims-for-2020-production/,2017/04/18,"
Electric production vehicles may be relatively rare, but electric concepts abound, and most of them are targeting 2020 for a rough production date, as is the Volkswagen I.D. CROZZ, an all-electric design whose name I hope dies in a horrible fire between now and whenever (if ever) it does end up hitting the street.
The name does do one thing adequately well — it conveys that this is a “crossover,” that adulated category of vehicle everyone everywhere is going gaga over lately. We once called these small SUVs or large hatchbacks, but we’ve all grown up since then. And as grown-ups, someone felt that when another person said CROZZ in a board room it was a good idea.
It was not; but the car bearing that name sounds perfectly okay — maybe even good. It’s got around 300 miles of electric range, and full all-wheel drive, along with boosted charging capabilities that let it recover 80 percent of its driving time in just 30 minutes of charging using 150kW DC chargers. The concept also has full self-driving capabilities, which are of course aspirational at this stage, but which a driver will be able to engage just by touching the VW badge in the center of the CROZZ’s steering wheel for three continuous seconds.

As with Volkswagen’s initial I.D. series concept vehicle, this electric car has digital “eyes” made up of LEDs on the outside that are meant to communicate with other drivers and pedestrians, and its inside also offers augmented reality displays to surround the driver with info overlaid right on the world around them.
Volkswagen goes so far as to call this concept a “smartphone on wheels” in a press release, which is about the most direct, unvarnished and accurate expression of the current strategy of most automakers I think I’ve ever heard. Truth in advertising.

373,Audi’s latest concept is a new all-electric Tesla Model X competitor,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/18/audis-latest-concept-is-a-new-all-electric-tesla-model-x-competitor/,2017/04/18,"
Audi’s newest electric vehicle is a crossover SUV with a 4.5-second 0-60mph time, and an impressive range of around 300 miles when its 95kWh battery is topped up. The Audi e-tron Sportback is set for production starting in 2019, and it’s part of Audi’s larger strategy to bring at least three fully electric cars to market by 2020, and to have a quarter of its overall lineup equipped with EV batteries by 2025.
The carmaker is pursuing electric options fairly aggressively, likely part of an overall shift dictated by its parent company Volkswagen, which has been more emphatic about its EV plans since its diesel emissions scandal. The e-tron Sportback definitely sounds like it could be a strong contender to help show that the electric strategy is full of potential for a range of buyers, and it would be nice to see a vehicle that can compete in many ways with Tesla’s gull-wing luxury electric SUV, the Model X.
Audi has already announced the all-electric e-tron quattro, which is set to begin being offered for sale in 2018, and by then, not to mention when the e-tron Sportback hits the market, there should be no shortage of options in the high-end electric SUV market, judging by the announced roadmaps of a number of carmakers.

Futuristic tech touches make the Audi a sight to behold, including Matrix LED, laser lighting and OLEDs designed to provide new levels of light-based communication with the outside world, as well as passengers within. Based on this and other concepts we’ve seen, if you’re not crazy about the idea of cars becoming “expressive” anthropomorphized futurist love bugs, the future isn’t for you.
The e-tron Sportback also all but does away with blind spots thanks to strategically positioned cameras that pipe real-time images to displays built into the interior of the car’s doors, giving you a view as to what’s going on all around.

374,Uber business tool lets you order multiple cars from central app,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/18/uber-business-tool-lets-you-order-multiple-cars-from-central-app/,2017/04/18,"
Uber finalized a new tool in its business arsenal today called Uber Central that enables business users to order multiple Ubers on behalf of customers or clients from a single app. It was originally announced in July.
The tool solves a problem businesses have had up to now, where they might need to order multiple cars for guests or customers, but were limited to one car per app at a time. This limitation actually makes sense for individual consumers, but is a problem for a business that wants to call several Ubers.
Business customers had been clamoring for a way to do this, and were actually using work-arounds like buying several phones and setting up multiple Uber accounts, specifically so they could order several cars at a time, Travis Bogard, Global GM at Uber for Business told TechCrunch.
The new product works in a similar way to the consumer version, except instead of ordering a single car, you can order multiple cars from the Uber Central interface. As with the consumer version, you enter the pickup location and the destination and the program figures the approximate cost of the ride. Since it’s tied to Uber for Business, each ride gets charged to the single business account automatically, and customers can take advantage of all the business back-end reporting and management capabilities in the business tool.

The passenger doesn’t need an Uber account or even a smartphone. After the car is ordered, they receive an SMS message with the make and model of the car, the license plate and the name of the driver when the car is on its way, and another when it arrives.
Customers can maintain templates, which they call “Drafts”, of commonly used routes like to an airport or train station from a hotel or to a satellite office from the main office (or whatever it happens to be).
When Central was first announced it was considered a stand-alone product, but through the Beta testing period, Uber began to see that it made more sense to deliver it as part of the Uber for Business platform, Bogard said. In fact, the company is thinking of layering on additional products on the business platform over time.
Customers, who activate Uber Central will pay a separate fee in addition to Uber for Business.

375,Uber’s VP of global vehicle programs is out,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/17/ubers-vp-of-global-vehicle-programs-is-out/,2017/04/17,"
Uber has lost yet another executive to continue the exodus of departures at the transportation company, Automotive News reports. This time, it’s Uber VP of Global Vehicle Programs Sherif Marakby, who helped launch Uber’s self-driving program in Pittsburgh.
“Sherif’s deep experience and knowledge of the automotive industry have helped us tremendously in working to make self-driving cars a reality,” an Uber spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch.
It’s not clear why Marakby left but Uber told Auto News that it was not related to the lawsuit with Waymo. It’s also not clear if he left as a result of the sexual harassment allegations, but something tells me that scandal probably didn’t make him particularly pumped to stick around. Marakby joined Uber last April after working at Ford for 25 years.
“Self-driving is one of the most interesting challenges I’ve worked on in my career, and I’m grateful to have contributed  to what will soon be a safer future for everyone,” Marakby said in a statement.
In the past few months, a gazillion people have left Uber. Ok, a gazillion is a bit of an exaggeration, but Marakby’s departure comes not too long after Uber lost its head of comms, president, head of AI Labs, VP of growth and SVP of engineering.

376,Tesla’s most affordable Model S is now even more affordable,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/17/teslas-most-affordable-model-s-is-now-even-more-affordable/,2017/04/17,"
Tesla dropped the price on their entry-level Model S, with a $5,000 discount to the 75kWh version, which now starts at $69,500. The price drop comes as Tesla stops selling the 60kWh model, which it discontinued recently and sold only until remaining stock ran out.
The price drop also comes with upgraded standard equipment, meaning you’ll get a better value overall. These include the all-glass overhead roof, and an automatic powered rear lift gate as standard features across all Model S battery options. Electrek reports that in addition to those changes, some other tweaks mean you can only get certain options on higher-priced models now, which it looks like are designed to help make sure the company continues to see a healthy mix of buyers at all points in its pricing matrix.
The Model S still isn’t “cheap” by any stretch of the imagination, but the pricing and option changes do mean your money goes farther at the entry-level for the vehicle lineup. The lesson is this: Patience is rewarded for would-be Tesla buyers – but of course, you need to take the plunge at some point if you want the car, so waiting forever isn’t an option.
Tesla also reached out to tell us it’ll increase prices slightly at the top end of the range, so that the average selling price of vehicles actually ends up being very similar to before. Here’s the full list of changes, including the increases coming April 24:
Model S

75: $69,500
75D: $74,500
90D: $87,500
100D: $97,500 (beginning 4/24)
P100DL: $140,000 (beginning 4/24)

Model X

75D: $82,500
90D: $93,500
100D: $99,500 (beginning 4/24)
P100DL: $145,000 (beginning 4/24)

Tesla also provided this official statement from a spokesperson:

Periodically we have adjusted pricing and available options to best reflect the value of our products and our customers’ preferences. Today’s updates include slight price decreases to our 75, 75D and 90D models to account for the discontinuation of our 60 kWh models, and next week will be implementing slight price increases to our higher end 100D and P100D models. We expect our total average selling price to remain almost exactly the same. 
 
Price increases for our 100D and P100D models will take effect on April 24, 2017 to best accommodate customers already in the order process, while price decreases for 75, 75D and 90D models will take effect today.

377,Google acquires Nevada land for future data center,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/17/google-acquires-nevada-land-for-future-data-center-possible-test-track/,2017/04/17,"
Google has acquired a significant piece of land in Nevada, near Reno and Tesla’s Gigafactory site, which will house a future data center, and could also host a testing track for Waymo, the Alphabet-owned autonomous driving company. The purchase of the 1,210 acres in Nevada’s Tahoe Reno Industrial Center was reported by The Wall Street Journal on Monday, and follows the filing of documents detailing the transaction late last week.
The purchase of land doesn’t mean Google is breaking ground on a new data center immediately; the report says there aren’t any plans in the books to start construction right away. But with increasing emphasis on its cloud-based business, it’s unlikely the company will sit idle on plans to build new data center infrastructure for long.
More interesting might be the WSJ’s assertion that several people suggested Google might use the site as a future testing facility for Waymo’s autonomous vehicles. Nevada is in the process of passing legislation that could see it eventually allow self-driving tests with potentially fewer restrictions than are in place for testing in California, which might make it a good site for high-speed testing of vehicles, above the 35 MPH cap currently in place in Google’s home state.
The theory that Google could use the land for testing of vehicles is based mostly on the regulatory conditions in Nevada, and its co-backing of the bill currently making its way through the legislative process, as well as the fact that the parcel of land is much larger than would be required for any single data center. Still, it’s an interesting possibility, and one that makes sense if Waymo wants to continue expanding its real-world testing capabilities.

378,A second life for open-world games as self-driving car training software,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/17/a-second-life-for-open-world-games-as-self-driving-car-training-software/,2017/04/17,"
A lot of top-tier video games enjoy lengthy long-tail lives with remasters and re-releases on different platforms, but the effort put into some games could pay dividends in a whole new way, as companies training things like autonomous cars, delivery drones and other robots are looking to rich, detailed virtual worlds to provided simulated training environments that mimic the real world.
Just as companies including Boom can now build supersonic jets with a small team and limited funds, thanks to advances made possible in simulation, startups like NIO (formerly NextEV) can now keep pace with larger tech concerns with ample funding in developing self-driving software, using simulations of real-world environments including those derived from games like Grand Theft Auto V. Bloomberg reports that the approach is increasingly popular among companies that are looking to supplement real-world driving experience, including Waymo and Toyota’s Research Institute.
There are some drawbacks, of course: Anyone will tell you that regardless of the industry, simulation can do a lot, but it can’t yet fully replace real-world testing, which always diverges in some ways from what you’d find in even the most advanced simulations. Also, miles driven in simulation don’t count towards the total miles driven by autonomous software figures most regulatory bodies will actually care about in determining the road worthiness of self-driving systems.
The more surprising takeaway here is that GTA V in this instance isn’t a second-rate alternative to simulation software created for the purpose of testing autonomous driving software – it proves an incredibly advanced testing platform, because of the care taken in its open-world game design. That means there’s no reason these two market uses can’t be more aligned in future: Better, more comprehensive open-world game design means better play experiences for users looking for that truly immersive quality, and better simulation results for researchers who then leverage the same platforms as a supplement to real-world testing.

379,Uber shares growing financials to distract from negative publicity,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/14/uber-shares-growing-financials-to-distract-from-negative-publicity/,2017/04/14,"
Uber, the popular ride-hailing startup, shared a grip of new financial metrics with Bloomberg today. The numbers indicate that the company is still growing at an impressive pace, and that despite staggering losses may be getting a handle on its cash burn.
The company’s numbers have leaked in various quantities before, but today’s disclosure is a welcome dose of sunlight. That Uber is releasing financial figures at this juncture is perhaps not surprising. The first quarter has concluded, and Uber has come under intense fire in the public realm for a broken culture, petulant leadership and an executive exodus. Also, its chief U.S. rival, Lyft, recently raised $600 million at a newly expanded valuation.
Uber, presumably, hopes that by releasing its revenue growth figures it can change the narrative concerning its business. The company, for some time, was known best as a disruptive startup busy setting records for growth. Its leadership would likely welcome a return to the prior storyline.
Today we’re going to walk through the numbers together. First, we’ll lay out the facts. Following, we’ll figure out what it all means. 
Facts, figures, adjusted losses
Uber had gross bookings of $20 billion, according to information shared with Bloomberg. Of that $20 billion, Uber counted $6.5 billion as net (GAAP) revenue. That works out to a cut of just under a third of all money flowing through Uber’s platform.
Uber lost 5 percent more in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the third. The firm lost $991 million in the final period of last year, according to Bloomberg, implying a loss of around $943 million in the third quarter.
The company lost an adjusted $2.8 billion in 2016. That figure rises to a $3.8 billion tally when losses related to Uber’s Chinese operation are included, according to a Bloomberg estimate. (Those results compare to loss of “at least $2 billion” in 2015, according to a previous Bloomberg report). Both figures do not “account for employee stock compensation, certain real-estate investments, automobile purchases and other expenses,” according to Bloomberg.
So, on an adjusted basis, Uber lost around $3.8 billion in 2016. The real figure, using a full-GAAP reckoning, is likely higher. Merely employing the $3.8 billion figure, Uber had a -58.5 percent profit margin in 2016.
Those stiff losses are countered in part by rapid revenue growth.
Bloomberg notes that Uber’s gross bookings rose by 28 percent from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2016, resulting in net revenue of $2.9 billion for the final three months of the year. However, revenue in the fourth quarter was up a far stronger 74 percent in the fourth quarter when compared to the third.
Why? According to Bloomberg, it boils down to what counts as net revenue:
Revenue includes only the portion Uber takes from fares, except in the case of its carpooling service; the company counts the entire amount of an UberPool fare as revenue. The more Uber’s business shifts to the multi-passenger service, the faster revenue grows.
That lessens how impressive Uber’s topline result for 2016 is, perhaps. And it certainly shifts how we might consider the company’s fourth-quarter growth. The delta between bookings and revenue growth is worth consideration.
Finally, the company has $7 billion in cash and access to billions more in credit according to the same report. Uber is no immediate risk of running short of funds.
Do the losses matter?
It is not a surprise that Uber loses money. The company is large enough that drips of its financial performance have been slipping through the cracks for some time.
However, that Uber is losing just under $1 billion on an adjusted basis per quarter is notable. That’s a staggering pace of burn, especially when you mentally adjust it to fully account for Uber’s cost profile.
Uber has previously had little to no issue raising capital to fuel its continuing operations and growth; however, given the taint of scandal currently swirling around the firm, and its continued losses despite its age, valuation and time-in-market, private investors could be less interested.
It isn’t hard to understand questions that new or potentially recurring investors might ask: Given that UberPOOL revenue is counted differently than traditional Uberx revenue, should we trust your non-GAAP revenue over the GAAP result? That would put Uber in the tough position of arguing that investors should only pay attention to its GAAP revenue, and its non-GAAP losses, while investors might have an inclination to the opposite, focusing instead on the company’s more modest non-GAAP revenues and its larger GAAP losses.
All that sums to a murky ask: What is Uber’s path to profitability?
The profitability hunt
Corrections and caveats aside, Uber’s adjusted operating margin dramatically improved in the fourth quarter compared to the third. Its GAAP revenue grew 74 percent while its adjusted losses grew a mild 5 percent. That means its ratio of top to (negative) bottom lines got better.
That is the sort of improvement that quickly growing, but yet-unprofitable companies like to show investors as they discuss their future. No company expects to lose money forever. Uber most certainly does not. Short-term losses for long-term profits are always the goal for well-funded, growth-oriented companies.
That clarifies our question about Uber’s path to profits as more a timing question: How quickly can Uber get to profitability?
It will depend on a host of factors, including the company’s ride-expense outflow. Uber currently provides some drivers with incentives to drive a certain amount in a set timeframe, for example.

Why is Uber sharing this?
This time Uber gave the financials to Bloomberg, a contrast from the many unauthorized leaks. It seems that they are trying to generate some favorable publicity at a time when the conversations around the company have been anything but.
Like many private companies, Uber generally likes to keep its business closely guarded. But CEO Travis Kalanick takes it a step further, repeatedly downplaying his interest in a future IPO, saying last year it would be “as late as humanly possible.”
Yet, as evident by the latest financials, Uber is losing a lot of money. That means it is very reliant on investors to keep giving it more.
Thus far, Uber has had success in attracting a long list of investors to add to its coffers, valuing the company at a massive $68 billion, making it by far the largest venture-backed company.
But the price is getting pretty steep and investors may be increasingly skeptical at Uber’s growth prospects. Venture investors are often aiming for 3x results within a decade, and with growing competition and a company culture rocked by scandals, it’s hard to make the case that the company will triple.
So going public would be one way that the company could continue to raise money. It’s also a way to keep employees happy, by providing them with some liquidity.
Perhaps this Bloomberg exclusive is a way to test the waters and see how the public reacts, but it’s likely just an attempt to thwart its growing cadre of naysayers.
What we still don’t know
While there have been financial leaks from different periods in time, we are lacking a clear picture of Uber’s revenue growth quarter-by-quarter and year-over-year.
And the way they account for UberPOOL revenue is murky. It would be helpful more detail about what percentage of this is paid to drivers.
We’ve posted “contribution margins,” which shows the revenue-cost breakdown of their primary ridesharing business, but we have yet to get the full account of Uber’s other endeavors.
UberEATS, its food-delivery business, has expanded to dozens of cities throughout the world. Based on a report from The Information last year, UberEATS was forecast to contribute $100 million in net revenue, but also contribute to more than $100 million in additional losses for 2017, due to the costs of incentivizing drivers to participate in this newer service.
Uber is growing, but so are losses, albeit at a slower pace than the revenue gains. The company is clearly hoping to get away with the Amazon model of reinvesting in growth, but eventually Uber is going to have to demonstrate to investors, public or private, that it knows how to make money.

380,GM plans to deploy hundreds of autonomous vehicles across the country for testing,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/14/gm-plans-to-deploy-hundreds-of-autonomous-vehicles-across-the-country-for-testing/,2017/04/14,"
GM is looking to leapfrog its competitors in the autonomous driving space by deploying a larger fleet of cars than any of them — perhaps as many as 300, according to documents obtained by IEEE Spectrum.
An admirable bit of digging on some FCC applications showed an application to deploy 3,000 vehicular radar units, with 10 units per vehicle. Shortly thereafter, GM filed a request to deploy the same type of radar, though it declined to indicate how many. And after that, Bosch applied to test a different radar, with 650 units covering up to 162 vehicles, though it wouldn’t say for whom.
Fortunately, Bosch did indicate where it would be deploying its radars: Detroit, San Francisco and Scottsdale. GM subsidiary Cruise Automation is the only company that tests in all those locations.
While the exact number is unclear — there could be a mix of the two radar types on each vehicle, and some devices may also be spare parts. But even a conservative estimate puts it well ahead of competitors at least in terms of sheer numbers of test vehicles on the road.
The FCC has yet to grant the special license for these vehicles and devices to operate, so it may be a while before they are deployed.

381,Apple gets permit to test autonomous cars in California,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/14/apple-gets-permit-to-test-autonomous-cars-in-california/,2017/04/14,"
It’s no secret, Apple has been working hard on a self-driving car. Today, the California DMV has released an updated list of companies allowed to test autonomous vehicles on the roads of California. The last name on the long list is Apple.
It doesn’t necessarily mean you’re going to see an Apple car on the road tomorrow. But it means the company can start real-world tests at some point in the future.
In particular, it’s going to be interesting to see if Apple is going to use third-party cars with its own technology and sensors. Rumor has it that Apple is now working on autonomous driving technology and not a full-fledged car.
Update: TechCrunch got the following statement from a DMV spokesperson: “Today, April 14, 2017, the California Department of Motor Vehicles issued Apple Inc. an autonomous vehicle test permit. The permit covers three vehicles, all 2015 Lexus RX450h, and six drivers.” It’s the exact same car Google has been using for its self-driving tests.
It’s going to take years before Apple has a final product. But it’s good to see that the company is still moving forward.
It’s also interesting to note that Apple is not afraid of exposing its cars on the roads of California. Apple hasn’t been as secretive as it usually is with this project. Building a self-driving car requires a ton of data, so the company needs to put its car on the road as quickly as possible.

It had partnered with major-league sports teams and their venues, as well as theaters, convention centers and other event spaces. Parking Panda made moves into Canada in 2016, so the acquisition gives Chicago-based SpotHero an entry into that market as well, bringing the current total of cities using the SpotHero service to 47 in 2017.
The top of the parking company’s food chain will remain unchanged. SpotHero CEO and co-founder Mark Lawrence will continue to be CEO, and Parking Panda CEO and founder Adam Zilberbaum will come along to SpotHero, as will COO James Bain.
In the past five years, SpotHero has raised more than $20 million. The company expects to park 20 million cars in 2017 alone, thanks to this acquisition. And in addition to expanding to new cities, the company is laying the foundation to enable shared driverless autonomous cars to park themselves while the fleet owner or current user pays via app.

383,Tesla will reveal the final production Model 3 in July,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/13/tesla-will-reveal-the-final-production-model-3-in-july/,2017/04/13,"
Tesla is going to show Tesla 3 buyers what their call will officially look like in July, Elon Musk revealed on Twitter on Thursday. The Model 3’s first unveiling took place in April of 2016, where it said cameras weren’t allowed (unless they were built into your phone). Because smartphones are as good as they are, we got a fairly decent look at what the Model 3 looked like at the time, but the car maker isn’t showing off what CEO Elon Musk terms ‘final’ hardware until July: A lot can change in over a year.
The Model 3 has been spotted since April, of course; Tesla has official press images, and had one sitting in a garage at its solar tile product unveiling late last year. The company has also shown off a short video of the “release candidate” version of the car accelerating quickly out of a parking lot, and the car looked relatively similar to what we saw at the unveiling.
More recently, spy shots have also been circulating, as those release candidate vehicles are going through the paces in real-world testing in and around Tesla HQ, where anyone with a camera can snap a spy shot. The images from this Autoblog gallery (more photos at the source) again don’t reveal much in the way of dramatic changes from what was on stage last April, but it does bear a more direct resemblance to the Model S than it did originally, which is likely a good thing given general reaction to the more expensive car’s design.

Surface resemblance aside, Musk and Tesla have taken steps lately to remind people that the Model 3 is not the top-end vehicle in Tesla’s lineup. The CEO said on Twitter in March that the Model 3 is clearly the lower-specced option, despite what some may think about it being some kind of “upgrade” in terms of tech because it follows the Model S chronologically.
In July we should also get clarity on the exact specifications and capabilities of the Mode 3. What we know so far is that it will have a minimum of 215 miles of range from its electric battery, and that it will cost $35,000 U.S. prior to incentives for the base model. Musk also teased a forthcoming “Performance model” in the works, but noted that this wouldn’t be available for sale for at least a year from now.

384,"Tesla to reveal a pickup truck within two years, and final Model 3 design in July",https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/13/tesla-to-reveal-a-pickup-truck-within-two-years-and-final-model-3-design-in-july/,2017/04/13,"
Tesla plans to show off an electric pickup truck sometime within the next two years, the company’s CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter today. The pickup was teased originally when Musk revealed the second part of his “master plan” for Tesla, which began with selling expensive vehicles like the Roadster and Model S, and eventually leads to producing a wide range of more affordable vehicles at scale.
The truck was previously described as a “new kind of pickup” by Musk, though he’s alluded to the concept even prior to that. Tesla’s desire to create a pickup makes sense given the success of the category in the company’s home country, and it’s likely planned alongside an upcoming lower cost compact SUV, sometimes referred to the Model Y.
Musk also teased a forthcoming semi truck announcement, set for September, and a convertible version of the Roadster coming in the next iteration of Tesla’s first vehicle, which is a high priced car targeted at luxury buyers.
There’s also good news for those customers still hoping to receive their Model 3 pre-orders relatively soon: The final reveal of the production version of the Model 3 is coming in July, Musk said, which would fit with reports of multiple prototypes on the streets around Tesla HQ, and its anticipated shipping timeline, which should see the first units go out to customers by the end of this year.
Musk has said that by offering the Model 3, along with the Model S and Model X premium vehicles, it should be able to offer a future compact SUV and a pickup to cover most of the available consumer market. For lower cost segments, he believes that group transportation options, including a forthcoming shuttle bus vehicle for multi-passenger transit, is the better way to go vs. lower coast consumer cars.

385,Tesla will reveal its electric semi truck in September,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/13/tesla-will-reveal-its-electric-semi-truck-in-september/,2017/04/13,"
Elon Musk just let us know when we’ll get a look at the electric semi truck that he’s teased in the past: The Tesla transport vehicle will be revealed in September, the CEO said on Twitter on Thursday, noting that the team has “done an amazing job” and that the vehicle is “seriously next level.”
Plans at Tesla for an electric semi truck have been in the works for a while now: The vehicle was first mentioned back in July of 2016, when Musk revealed part 2 of his fabled “master plan” for his electric vehicle company. The Tesla Semi, as Musk called it, is designed to help reduce the cost of cargo transportation, and improve safety for drivers, according to the CEO at the time.
Tesla’s not the only company targeting electric drivetrains for transport vehicles; Nikola revealed its One vehicle last year, too, though that’s a hybrid that also uses compressed natural gas in addition to its electric battery.
Tesla’s goal overall is to “expand to cover the major forms of terrestrial transport,” according to Musk’s “master plan,” and the transport truck is part of that goal. It addresses commercial goods transportation, which represents a significant portion of the commercial transport market; Musk has also teased that the company will eventually reveal a shuttle bus-type of vehicle that will address the other major aspect of that market.

386,Honda’s Silicon Valley Lab becomes Honda Innovations,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/13/hondas-silicon-valley-lab-becomes-honda-innovations/,2017/04/13,"
Honda has turned its Silicon Valley Lab into a new company officially called Honda R&D Innovations, Inc., but known colloquially as Honda Innovations. The company will pursue research and product development beyond just cars, and will also look to partner with startups and other companies on future projects, Honda says.
Honda Innovations will still be headquartered in Mountain View, and its new CEO is the former senior program director of Honda Silicon Valley Lab, Nick Sugimoto, so it definitely inherits a lot from its previous incarnation. The company will spearhead development of projects looking at IoT and connected vehicles/cities, human machine interface projects, robotics and machine intelligence including AI, as well as personal mobility and sharing economy services. The new company will also be the contact point for ongoing discussions with Waymo about integrating the Alphabet-owned company’s self-driving tech in future Honda vehicles.

The new entity will also oversee Honda’s Developer Studio and Xcelerator programs, which focus on software application creation for Honda’s various platforms, and on providing early- to late-stage startups with funding and support, respectively. Basically, this is Honda’s U.S.-based tech subsidiary, something which a lot of automakers are creating to one degree or another.

Lucid is continuing down its path of shipping a Tesla competitor, and the Air just underwent another milestone: High-speed testing. A performance-targeted prototype version of its flagship Air car, the first it’s intending to bring to production, hit Ohio’s 7.5-mile TRC test track to check out how it holds up under high-speed use, including a (software limited) top speed of 217 mph.
The performance testing is designed to help the team identify where the car is performing as expected in conditions that, while not likely to be encountered often in daily use, will still prove part of the appeal of the vehicle to its first customers. The Lucid Air will cost $52,500, once federal tax credits are applied, so while it’s not at the lofty height of the Tesla Model S, it’s still very much a vehicle owners will expect to keep up with others in the premium category.
The high-speed capabilities of the car also aren’t at odds with Lucid’s core goal of creating a vehicle that’s extremely efficient; to the contrary, Lucid says that the same things that make it an excellent performance vehicle will help it maximize its energy consumption when driven more normally, too.

388,Luminar reveals sensors that could make self-driving cars safer than human,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/13/luminar-debuts-a-sensor-to-make-self-driving-cars-safer-than-human/,2017/04/13,"
Cameras help autonomous vehicles read street signs and the color of traffic lights. But LiDARs, aka light detection and ranging systems, do the important work of sensing and helping cars avoid obstacles, whether that’s a fallen tree, drunk driver, or a child running out into the road.
Now, a startup called Luminar Technologies Inc., is unveiling a high-resolution LiDAR sensor that was five years in the making. The startup, which has raised $36 million in seed-stage funding so far, built its LiDAR systems from scratch. That means the company engineered its own: lasers, receivers, chips, packaging and more, rather than incorporating off-the-shelf components.
Investors in Luminar have included: Canvas Ventures, GVA Capital, and the Peter Thiel-backed 1517 Fund. According to Luminar’s CEO and cofounder Austin Russell, the company’s LiDARs give cars the ability to see obstacles ahead in much greater detail, and at much greater distances than any other systems on the market today. The LiDARs also work in inclement weather, through fog and dust. The company has not yet disclosed the price it will charge per sensor.
Predecessors and competitors offering LiDAR for self-driving vehicles include Quanergy, Velodyne, and Alphabet-owned Waymo, among others. At twenty-two years old, Russell is confident his technology has them all beat in terms of performance.
Luminar CEO and cofounder Austin Russell
At the age of two, Russell had already memorized the periodic tables, by twelve he wrote his first patent, and perhaps predictably he later dropped out of Stanford with a $100,000 Thiel Fellowship.
He said, “My role models were primarily in physics and engineering. I admire the classics like Newton, Tesla and Einstein. They all came up with a new way of thinking about a problem in order to be able to advance an entire field, rather than making incremental improvements to some specific technology.”
The problem most LiDAR makers are trying to solve, Russell points out, is one of affordability. Many auto-grade LiDARs still cost tens of thousands of dollars. Instead of simply making easier-to-manufacture, and cheaper versions of existing tech, Luminar sought to build a higher-performing sensor, even if it used exotic materials and operated at a different wavelength than industry standards.
Luminar invited TechCrunch to see a demonstration of its systems at San Francisco’s Pier 35, a terminal with a long straightaway. There, employees had arranged mannequins of different heights dressed in different colors, as well as life-sized decoy deers, car tires, and signs that marked the distance every 25 meters or so. At the distance of 200 meters, Luminar placed a large canvas painted the same hue as a common black car.
Luminar CEO Austin Russell conducting LiDAR systems tests at Pier 35 in San Francisco.
The company had purchased vehicles straight from BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Tesla and other dealerships, equipped them with its own LiDAR sensors, and was driving those cars around Pier 35. Monitors in the cars displayed maps of the world around the moving vehicle, drawn in real-time from the LiDAR data.
The Luminar system, operated by CTO and cofounder Jason Eichenholz, clearly portrayed: a bicyclist weaving in and out of the road, at 100 meters and further away; a small pigeon that suddenly scurried about 40 meters in front of their car; and they clearly showed the human form of the mannequins, even those dressed in dark garb; as well as the black-painted canvas at the end of the pier.
By contrast, data streaming in from other LiDAR makers would only show a few dots or a meager line indicating that an object lay ahead. Other systems could not specify objects or even detect dark walls and the mannequins dressed in darker clothes. And earlier LiDAR sensors only showed what was happening within about a 35- to 50-meter range.
Luminar CTO and cofounder Jason Eichenholz at Pier 35 in San Francisco.
If you’re not familiar with how LiDAR works, TechCrunch has a handy primer here. But at the highest level, LiDARs send beams of light out, which bounce back and generate data points that build a picture of a car’s surroundings and the distance and density of objects ahead.
Luminar’s LiDARs send out millions of laser pulses per second. They give the vehicle a 120-degree range of view. They also allow optical zoom, or more concentrated analysis of any obstacles near a car.
Russell said, “If you notice, a lot of self-driving vehicles are limited to operating at or below 25 miles per hour. These are things like delivery robots, or robots used in warehouses. We can see objects at 200 meters, while driving 75 miles per hour. That means you have about 7 seconds of time for your car to react. Other lidars only give one second of reaction time.”

Luminar investor Rebecca Lynn, a partner at Canvas VC, said now that the company is putting its systems out on the market, she expects Luminar will become a major strategic player in automotive. Indeed, the CEO said car companies have already offered to buy up, at any price, all the LiDARs that Luminar plans to produce in its first run, starting this year.
The startup is using some of its significant seed funding to build a 50,000 square foot factory in Orlando, Fla. Its headquarters office, however, is in Portola Valley, Calif.
While some argue that self-driving cars will be able to rely on cameras alone for perception, Lynn said: “LiDAR will be able to save more lives than any technology being developed today, from genomics to AI. There are many things that will make our lives easier or better. But looking at tech that can truly save lives, it is autonomous driving. And you cannot have fully safe autonomous driving without LiDAR.”

389,"In Portland, Uber launches initiative to add electric vehicles to its fleet",https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/12/uber-electric-vehicle-initiative-in-portland-oregon/,2017/04/12,"
With a new electric vehicle initiative, Uber is finally speaking Portland’s language. The company shares a rocky history with the famously green city, but that won’t stop Portland from becoming the first U.S. market where Uber will push a set benchmarks for electrifying its fleet.
For the Portland version of Uber Electric, a program that the company rolled out to London last year, the ride-hailing company will team up with Drive Oregon, a partially state-funded nonprofit that seeks to get more electric vehicles on the road. With a combination of incentives and educational initiatives, Uber aims to make 10 percent of its Oregon fleet electric by 2019, statewide. Right now, the company says that 100 of the 6,000 active Portland Uber drivers use electric vehicles, so it has considerable work to do (beyond all of that other work it has to do).
To reach its 10 percent goal, Uber is pursuing a range of local collaborations. The company will work with Portland’s Black Parent Initiative to expand electric vehicle access to underserved communities, Cynergy E-Bikes to connect UberEATS couriers with electric bikes and Arcimoto, an Oregon-based EV company. Uber is expected to use its auto-lease subsidiary Xchange Leasing to offer in-house deals to drivers wishing to get behind the wheel of an EV.
“The City of Portland has also adopted some of the nation’s most aggressive measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” Uber stated about its mission in the city. “Uber Electric will help Portland and the state of Oregon achieve these important clean energy goals.”
Uber isn’t the only alternative transportation company going electric in Portland. Late last year, the city became the second market for BMW’s ReachNow, a Zipcar-like service with a focus on electric vehicles, and a previous initiative by Car2Go that sprinkled electric smart cars onto its rainy streets all the way back in 2012.
In a world where a quarter of cars could drive themselves by 2030, Uber’s decision to take two years to recruit a few hundred EV drivers is more incremental than revolutionary. Still, it shows that the company is implementing both long- and short-term strategies for rethinking transportation, even in the midst of one of the worst PR crises the tech industry has ever known.

390,Toyota’s FT-4X concept is your ‘millennial casualcore’ dream SUV,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/12/toyotas-ft-4x-concept-is-your-millennial-casualcore-dream-suv/,2017/04/12,"
Yes, Toyota used both “millennial” and “casualcore” to dreadful effect in the press release for the new FT-4X crossover SUV concept it revealed during the New York International Auto Show. But I still want this adorable car box to become a real thing, because it reminds me of both the Honda Element and the Toyota FJ Cruiser, vehicles I love so well. The FT-4X likewise presents a satisfyingly angular box you can easily put your dog and outdoor gear into, and Toyota’s also sprinkled tech features liberally throughout its interior like so much gadget blogger catnip.
The FT-4X is the product of Toyota’s Calty Design Research Newport Beach design studio, which also came up with its fun Concept-i vehicle from CES this year, which was likewise a cause célèbre among us tech watchers. The FT-4X doesn’t house a friendly AI companion, but it does offer up a rear hatch that can act as a shelter from the elements, as well as a side-opening door for easy loading and unloading.
There are power outlets in the back, and USB outlets integrated into the armrests in the cabin. The rear cabin light pops out to act as a flashlight, and there are also integrated water bottles and storage boxes built into armrests and door grips. It’s got more modularity than you could ever hope to need, but will still definitely want to have available regardless.

Like other chipmakers, Japan’s Renesas is putting focus on an emerging industry: autonomous cars. The Tokyo-based company announced the R-Car Consortium at a trade fair in the city this week, highlighting its efforts to bring together engineers and researchers from Japan, the U.S., Europe, China and South Korean companies and academic institutions. The goal of the collaboration is to further autonomous driving technology, and it’s already resulted in a fully autonomous demonstration vehicle created by Renesas.
The company is touting its automotive-grade chips as its biggest strength, which will help autonomous vehicles work in all driving conditions, and do so over time. The focus the company has placed on autonomy also extends to cybersecurity concerns, according to Renesas President Bunsei Kure, as reported by Nikkei. To concentrate more fully on the growing opportunity, Renesas has reconfigured its business, allocating resources previously used in areas including video game consoles and smartphones towards autonomous driving tech.
Renesas is pursuing a number of vehicle-related technologies, including a new radar tech to be used in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) with ADI, as well as a new chip for use in forward-facing cameras designed for both autonomous vehicles and ADAS systems. The chip-maker is hardly alone in seeking to stake out its claim in the autonomous driving space: Qualcomm acquired automotive silicon powerhouse NXP, and Intel is in the process of acquiring Israeli sensor and software company Mobileye.

Lincoln is testing a new service for owners of its vehicles that supply a driver on demand. The service is like a very upscale Uber, in which you supply the car, and Lincoln supplies a professional driver – one who is actually a Lincoln employee, not a spot contractor – to ferry you around, return your car to your home, and basically make you feel like a VIP.
The service will launch first in Miami, reports Autoblog, and will let Lincoln owners order up a chauffeur via a smartphone app. The chauffeur will not only be able to drive you around, but will also return your car to your home in case others in the household need to use it, will fill it up if so required, and can even run light errands like picking up some groceries.
Costs, as you might expect, are not cheap: During the pilot program, Lincoln Chauffeur will run around $30 per hour, which is actually not terrible compared to Uber until you remember you have to supply the car as well. On the plus side for Lincoln owners, they’ll get eight hours free of Chauffeur service included in the purchase price.
This is only a limited test at the moment, but Lincoln tells Autoblog that it would like to expand the service to San Diego next, and then additional markets after that. It’s likely a decent challenge to scale, since Lincoln’s actually employing the drivers it’s using.
Lincoln Chauffeur may be a bit of a departure from other mobility service offerings automakers are exploring, which include on-demand vehicle rentals and even white glove delivery to a renter’s door, but it still sounds like an interesting way to add value while driving new revenue sources in the luxury segment.

393,Booster brings fuel to your office parking lot,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/12/booster-brings-fuel-to-your-office-parking-lot/,2017/04/12,"
Booster‘s tiny purple tankers have been cruising parking lots in Dallas-Fort Worth and the San Francisco area for 18 months now, and it’s ready to let the world in on its not-so-secret service. Companies can contract with Booster to have its employees’ gas tanks filled during the workday.
When you arrive at work and pull into a parking space, if your employer is savvy enough to offer this perk, you just mark your location using the Booster app and leave the gas door open. (You have to trust your prank-prone coworkers to not dump sugar and the like in your tank.) The car stays locked; Booster has no need for anything inside as long as the fuel door is popped before you leave the car. The purple tanker will pull up during a set window of time, your tank will be filled, and Booster will send you a receipt.
The user does pay for the fuel via a stored credit card. Booster charges a “competitive price” for gas, which fluctuates depending on day and location. It offers both regular and premium gasoline right now and hopes to offer diesel in the future.
In the year and a half since the service began operating, it’s pumped 3 million gallons of gasoline into user’s vehicles without incident. According to the company’s press release, this service has reduced the collective carbon footprint of its users by 162 tons, since they don’t have to drive to a gas station just to get more gas. It’s not as emissions-free as an EV, but it’s an improvement.
The service drivers have hazardous materials training and the pumps have Weights and Measures approval, just like station pumps do, so if they pump a gallon, it really is a gallon. The company has raised $12 million in venture capital from Maveron and Madrona Venture Group.

394,"Renault ZOE writes On the Road fanfic, becomes first AI hipster",https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/11/renault-zoe-writes-on-the-road-fanfic-becomes-first-ai-hipster/,2017/04/11,"
An all-electric Renault ZOE is writing fan fiction based on Jack Kerouac‘s novel “On the Road” to demonstrate how far modern EVs can travel on a charge. It’s also a celebration of the novel’s sixtieth anniversary in 2017. Also, presumably, this will impress ZOE’s latest crush, who loves Beat literature.
The car uses live driving data and artificial intelligence to generate fan fiction authorized by the Kerouac estate in the style of the famous novel. The AI takes information from internal and external sensors as the car drives through Stockholm and turns it into “contextual storylines,” according to the press release. These stories are unique to each driver, depending on what inputs occur during the drives.
The first step was to analyze the book using the Watson API. The analysis looked for language usage, emotions and social cues in the text. This is the basis for ZOE’s “in the style of” fanfic.
The ZOE has a Raspberry Pi on board with a data collecting scanner, 4G modem and GPS, plus the usual array of sensors in a modern vehicle. A bunch of data is collected from the sensors and the scanner, including speed, acceleration, braking, weather, nearby places and geopositioning.
The ZOE puts all those data points together to generate a Kerouac-style story on the fly based on conditions. It uses the same text-to-speed technology as the Amazon Alexa to read the results out loud in real time during the drive. Back at the project’s HQ, the driver receives a thermal-printed version of the story.
The goal of the project, according to Renault, is to ease consumers’ range anxiety by showing that an electric vehicle like the Renault ZOE can travel 400 km (about 250 miles) on one charge and write a freakin’ novel in the process. I’m not sure how convincing that will be to potential EV buyers, but it’s on the clever side of quirky.

395,"25% of U.S. driving could be done by self-driving cars by 2030, study finds",https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/10/25-of-u-s-driving-could-be-done-by-self-driving-cars-by-2030-study-finds/,2017/04/10,"
Self-driving still seems to be a ways off from active public use on regular roads, but once it arrives, it could ramp very quickly, according to a new study by the Boston Consulting Group. The study found that by 2030, up to a quarter of driving miles in the U.S. could be handled by self-driving electric vehicles operating in shared service fleets in cities, due mostly to considerable cost savings for urban drivers.
The big change BCG sees is a result of the rise in interest in autonomous technologies, paired with the increased electrification of vehicles. There’s also more pressure on cities to come up with alternate transportation solutions that address increasing congestion. All of that added together could drive reduction in costs by up to 60 percent for drivers who opt into using shared self-driving services vs. owning and operating their own cars.
This won’t result in a precipitous drop in the car sales market, however, according to BCG. Total demand for cars will remain high, but the shift of who owns them and how they’re used will change dramatically, if the report’s findings prove correct – particularly in large cities where the fleets could have ramifications including decreased traffic congestion, but also decreased ridership, which the research firm says could lead to regulated limits on how many self-driving taxi services can operate in a given area.
Ultimately, the dramatic uptake is down to cold, hard cash: BCG says that shared fleets might be able to effectively double discretionary income for the average city-dweller over the course of a year, and we all know fun money is a powerful motivator.
Studies don’t always line up with reality, of course, but it’s clear automakers are investing in and planning for a future in which shared fleet services play a key role in their city-based business. Timelines can easily change, but this looks like a reasonable picture of our eventual future.

396,Char.gy taps into lampposts to charge your electric car,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/10/char-gy-zaps-the-street-furniture-for-super-powers/,2017/04/10,"
If you have a garage with a power socket, an electric car makes an awful lot of sense. If you park on the street, however, the infrastructural challenge of keeping your electron-powered vehicle topped up becomes complicated enough that perhaps sticking to driving on squished dinosaurs makes sense for a while longer. Until Char.gy comes along, that is.
“Seventy-two percent of drivers in London don’t have off-street parking,” says Richard Stobart, CEO of the London-based Char.gy. “If you want an electric car, not being able to charge at home is a major disincentive.”
So, in a world where people want to drive electric cars, cities are trying to clean up the air and car makers want to sell electric cars, how do you take on the not insignificant challenge of charging car batteries in a dense and fast-moving city such as London? You tap into other, already existing infrastructure, of course.

“People want to charge their cars while they are doing something else, preferably when they are parked at home and asleep in their beds,” Stobart points out, and offers a solution. The company has developed charge points that connect to the existing street furniture: Lampposts. Makes sense: The cables are already there, the local government owns them, and once you’ve gone that far, you may as well make the next couple of logical steps.
“Our vision is that there will be several lampposts near your home with a charge-point that you can park near to charge overnight,” Richard explains. “We are developing a platform to manage the charging too, using a business model not dissimilar from mobile phone contracts. Users pay a monthly fee for access to the charge points and a free allocation of charge.”
The early-stage company is running a pilot program with Richmond Council in London, installing a number of units in Barnes and Kew, with the first charging points appearing later this summer.
“We are trying to create a win-win solution for everyone, not least local government,” says Stobart, addressing part of the challenge of building a marketplace with multiple players. “We are making it seamless and effectively free for the councils and solving the problem of half of all public charge points being out of service.”

398,GM’s ‘Super Cruise’ Tesla Autopilot competitor arrives in a Cadillac this fall,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/10/gms-super-cruise-tesla-autopilot-competitor-arrives-in-a-cadillac-this-fall/,2017/04/10,"
GM will launch its Super Cruise advanced highway automatic driving feature this fall, debuting first in the new Cadillac CT6. Super Cruise has been in the works for a few years now, and the semi-autonomous drive mode is finally almost ready for its debut, after its release date was pushed from 2016 to 2017 to give engineers more time to focus on designing the safest system possible.
Super Cruise offers features very similar to Tesla’s Autopilot, which can take over control of driving in highway settings, maintaining lane position and adapting speed based on surrounding traffic. The feature will be available on a limited basis, with access narrowed to “divided, limited-access highways” with “defined ‘on’ and ‘off’ ramps” according to The Verge. The system will also track driver head position using infrared cameras built into the steering wheel that will make sure they pay attention while the feature is engaged, and will alert them via a steering-wheel mounted light notification system, and audio alerts, if they stop.
GM has also incorporated a fail-safe measure that will safely stop the vehicle if a driver ends up not being able to respond to the alerts, a feature which Tesla also implements in its Autopilot software. Super Cruise can also be updated over-the-air, another similarity between it and Tesla’s offering.
Unlike Autopilot, however, GM’s semi-autonomous highway driving features incorporate LiDAR data – Tesla has refrained from equipping its vehicles with the high-resolution laser detection tech, and GM likewise isn’t putting LiDAR on consumer cars. Cost of components and the aesthetics likely make this an unappealing way to go, but GM has an interesting workaround to both use LiDAR data and keep it off production vehicles: It’s deploying a fleet of LiDAR mapping cars that will image highways where Super Cruise is used and make that information available to the system over-the-air.
The option is a paid add-on, with a $2,500 upgrade price and a $3,100 additional requirement if you get a trim-model that doesn’t include a driver assist suite lumped into the existing price.
Super Cruise finally getting on the road is definitely exciting, but this is also the year Elon Musk has said he’s aiming to field a first coast-to-coast test of Tesla’s full self-driving technology. In other words, we’re off to the autonomous races.

Some babies won’t sleep unless they get a nighttime cruise around the neighborhood, as many parents (my own included) can attest. That’s why Ford’s latest creation isn’t a car at all – it’s a small cot for babies called Max Motor Dreams (via CNET) that simulates a drive using sound and motion, along with LED lighting designed to mimic yellow-hued streetlights.
The sound comes from actual recorded road noise, captured via an app on your phone. The motion? That’s down to small motors under the bed that provide movement so it feels like the crib is in motion – even though it’s not actually moving.

If you are furiously seeking a “buy” link you can give up now – there’s only one of these, because Ford isn’t a crazy company that likes throwing money away on outlier ideas. The Max Motor Dreams could see an eventual production run, however, pending interest, which might be a thing that happens IRL but probably not.
For now enjoy these images of this precious, eccentric design exercise. The wood trim makes it, really.

How do you like your eggs? If you answered “Easter,” you have something in common with billionaire tech visionary Elon Musk, who never tires of building the things into the software for his Tesla vehicles. Now, the CEO is teasing a forthcoming Easter Egg for people he’s heard like Easter Eggs: An Easter Egg with Easter Eggs in its Easter Egg.
Musk’s tweet suggests a way to access all the past Easter Eggs made available via Tesla software updates from one central access point – with the caveat that this includes all “discovered” hidden fun time secrets. Use of that word suggests there may be some hidden features left untouched within the Tesla car OS, which likely means the more dedicated treasure hunters are already furiously poking away at the 17-inch center console of their car.
If you find another one, kindly share with the rest of the class.

402,Otonomo raises $25M to help automakers make money from connected cars,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/07/otonomo-raises-25m-to-help-automakers-make-money-from-connected-cars/,2017/04/07,"
It’s no secret that data is the hot new revenue source for automakers, who are seeing additional profit opportunities bloom as vehicles become more connected and they can retrieve a ton of useful data that’s incredibly valuable when deployed correctly. Israeli startup otonomo has been on top of that trend since its founding in 2015, with nine automakers worldwide using its platform to feed a marketplace that connects car makers and drivers with service providers, optimizing the monetization of that data.
Otonomo just raised a new $25 million Series B funding round, provided by strategic investors and led by leading automotive supplier Delphi. The round also included participation from existing investors, including Bessemer Venture Partners, StageOne Ventures and Maniv Mobility, and will be used to help otonomo accelerate the pace of its global expansion plans.
The company now has $40 million in total funding, including investment from leading VCs and former vice-chairman of GM Steve Girsky. The company’s ability to land funding and customers, including Daimler, the only one of its nine automaker clients it can reveal publicly right now, is down to the growing appetite for driving data, according to otonomo CEO and co-founder Ben Volkow.
“There are more and more connected cars out there, and those connected cars are sending a lot of data in the background all the time to big databases the car manufacturers have built,” Volkow explained. “They send the data between every minute to every three or four minutes depending on the model, and also when you start the car, when you park the car or when you have an event.”
All this data is valuable to car makers, for their own use in developing new vehicles, services and technologies. But it’s also an additional cost load to bear.
“It costs a lot of money for the OEs; putting the modem in the car is like $100, then you have to pay AT&T about $5 per month to get the data out, then it’s about $1 to store the data,” Volkow said. “So we started talking to the car companies and they’re telling us ‘Connectivity, it’s a thing – show us the money.’ That’s what we do: We want to move from the age of data mobilization, to the age of data monetization.”
Otonomo’s platform is a cloud solution, with nothing additional required in the car, that connects on one side to the databases of the car manufacturers, and on the other to different services and applications that want this data. This group of customers including insurance companies, smart cities, workshops, dealerships, developers, and even hedge funds – “everybody wants car data,” as Volkow puts it.
Basically, the startup is helping car companies build new business from the data, and that’s become a very lucrative proposition. It helps that selling data is around 100 percent margin, Volkow notes, while selling actual cars is a single digit margin game.
Some examples of how services can use car data to supplement their own businesses include insurance companies sending out tow trucks. If they can instead identify a problem in advance and send a message to the driver, they’ll save the cost of that truck dispatch. Likewise, you can identify issues in the road early for maintenance by analyzing driving data in the aggregate, avoiding more costly infrastructure repairs.
But how does otonomo handle privacy? Volkow says there are a lot of regulations around use of this data coming, and otonomo is proactive about working with them. He says his company makes sure in advance that the automakers are in compliance with local regulations, and that they also factor in the rules set out by car makers, the rules set out by app makers and service providers, and the permissions agreed to by drivers and tell the OEMs what they can safely do.
Regulation and increased restrictions around use of data might be otonomo’s biggest prospective roadblock, but even with tighter controls it seems likely automotive data will remain a boom industry for the foreseeable future, on both sides of the marketplace. Key, longtime industry leaders like Delphi recognize this opportunity and its growing worth, which is why its participation in this round is a strong endorsement of otonomo’s model.

AeroMobil, a European company that hopes to bring a flying car to market, has raised an additional €3 million ($3.2 million US) to help fund the production and demonstration of a new physical model of its vehicle, following the successful development and testing of the craft’s mathematical and geometric design.
The company has already been demonstrating the ability of its craft to successfully navigate both air and land, using the AeroMobil 3.0 prototype it debuted in late 2014. The pre-launch craft closely approximates the final version, and the company now says it’s even closer to that production craft, with the forthcoming physical model resembling closely the version intended for production.

AeroMobil’s new funding comes from individual investor Patrick Hessel, himself a founder of c2i, a maker of aerospace and automotive parts constructed from composite material. c2i is a supplier for AeroMobil, and recently sold a majority ownership stake to LG Hausy, an LG subsidiary that supplies lightweight components for use in aviation and automotive applications.

Lyft has just raised a big new round, according to a new report from the Financial Times. The round brings in over $500 million in new funding, and sets the valuation for the ride hailing company at $6.9 billion (pre-money), which is well north of their $4.5 billion (again, pre-money) valuation from their previous funding round in January of last year.
Even at $6.9 billion, Lyft is still worth ten times less than its rival Uber, according to the FT, which has a $61.2 billion total pre-money valuation. The new $500 million round could climb to around $600 million prior to close, the report says, once all investors are in.
Lyft’s last public round was a $1 billion round featuring a $500 million investment from GM, which is partnering with the ride hailing business on a number of fronts, including on a pilot of a self-driving service and an arrangement regarding short-term rentals of vehicles for Lyft drivers without their own cars.
Back in early March, TechCrunch reported that Lyft was seeking a valuation of around $6 billion with this funding, and the Wall Street Journal reported that it was looking to put together a $500 million round. The new Financial Times report backs this claim, though it seems the valuation has climbed.
Lyft is likely capitalizing on the recent reversals faced by its chief rival Uber, which is dealing with sexual harassment and internal cultural issues, a public CEO outburst, self-driving program hiccups and more. That’s one way to boost your perceived value.
We contacted Lyft for more information, but did not immediately received a response.

Austrian EV tuner Kreisel is making a name for itself in the world of high-performance electric conversions. After creating a purely electric Mercedes G-Class with Arnold Schwarzenegger, the company has now revealed the EVEX 910e, a converted Porsche 910 that has a fully electric drive train, max speeds north of 185 mph, a 0 to 60 time of under 2.5 seconds and more.
The electric supercar is street legal, and was developed in partnership with EVEX Fahrzeugbau GmbH, a car maker that focuses specifically on 1970s and 80s vintage sports cars. The car can be bought, in limited quantities, provided you have considerable resources: It’s priced at a lofty 1 million euros.
Kreisel’s conversion gives the EVEX 910e 490HP via its electric motor, while producing zero emissions. It features a unique 2-speed transmission created by the Kreisel brothers, which can also be purchased separately. The car’s max range of around 215 miles on battery power is described as “realistic” by the company, rather than guided by official measurement systems like the EPA standard. Rapid charging can quickly boost the power, and it’s been built so that when paired with a home solar installation, it can act as a battery and store power to feed back into the house.

407,Volkswagen doubles down on China with $180M investment in smart technology for cars,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/06/volkswagen-mobvoi-china/,2017/04/06,"
Volkswagen is doubling down on China and AI in one fell swoop after the automaker announced a $180 million investment in Chinese startup Mobvoi to bring smart technology into its cars.
Unlike a regular capital raise, VW’s money is going into a joint-venture that will “develop and apply AI technologies to automotive industry” rather than Mobvoi itself, the companies said in a statement. VW and Mobvoi will retain 50-50 ownership of the venture.
Beijing-based Mobvoi is a five-year-old startup specializing artificial intelligence, and in particular voice recognition and natural language processing tech. Prior to today, Mobvoi had raised $75 million from investors, including an undisclosed Series C round from Google in 2015. The company was founded by former Googler Zhifei Li.
Mobvoi is best known for its Ticwatch smartwatch, which raised over $2 million on Kickstarter, and Chinese voice-based assistant Chumenwenwen. The company ventured into automotive last year with a smart rear-view mirror that integrates messaging app WeChat, navigation and more, and it seems like that product piqued VW’s interest suitably.
The first fruits of the VC will be the smart mirror, which will be developed and optimized for Volkswagen cars.
“We are impressed by Mobvoi’s innovative approach of AI technology, and we are pleased to form this joint venture to explore the next generation of smart mobility,” Dr. Jochem Heizmann, president and CEO of Volkswagen China said in a statement.
The German carmaker sold 10.3 million vehicles last year to make it the world’s biggest automobile seller. China was a critical component of that success, and its deliveries in the country rose 12.2 percent. That’s largely because it doesn’t sell diesel vehicles in the country, that shielded its China business from issues around its global emission scandal.
Today’s alliance with Mobvoi comes four months after Volkswagen announced mobility solution platform Moia. The separate company exists under the VW umbrella and is dedicated to disruptive transportation, including fleet-based commuter shuttles and, eventually, autonomous on-demand solutions.

408,"Ford to bring plug-in hybrid to China in 2018, targeting mostly electrified lineup by 2025",https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/06/ford-to-bring-plug-in-hybrid-to-china-in-2018-targeting-mostly-electrified-lineup-by-2025/,2017/04/06,"
Ford is going to be focusing on electrification across its lineup in China, with plans to electrify most of its vehicle offerings in the country by 2025, Reuters reports. The long-term plan will begin with the launch of a plug-in hybrid electric sedan called the Mondeo Energi with local partner Changanin China in 2018, and then a fully electric SUV sometime within the next five years, Ford says.
The electric rollout makes sense given the mandate set by the Chinese government to encourage the development and sale of electric vehicles, alongside aggressive targets for vehicle fuel economy and emissions limits, along with subsidies available for automakers who embrace alternative, clean fuel systems.
China announced tighter restrictions on electric vehicles and new-energy cars (the category of vehicles in China that includes plug-in hybrids) in January, but these were designed to discourage startups and other smaller companies from venturing into the market in search of subsidies when they couldn’t deliver actual quality vehicles. The change in practice is actually likely to benefit automakers like Ford, by avoiding a market crowded with low quality entrants that still woo potential customers by undercutting on price.

409,Einride’s electric self-driving T-pod is a new kind of freight transport vehicle,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/06/einrides-electric-self-driving-t-pod-is-a-new-kind-of-freight-transport-vehicle/,2017/04/06,"
Self-driving trucks are attracting a lot of investment and attention, what with Otto’s drama and platooning tech developed by key players like Peloton, but Swedish transport startup Einride has a different vision of how freight will move around roads in the future. The company revealed its ‘T-Pod’ design Thursday, an electric vehicle with self-driving capabilities that can carry 15 pallets of goods 124 miles while producing zero emissions.
The T-Pod isn’t a truck in the traditional sense; it’s more like a boxcar with an electric motor and remote operating capabilities. While it’s capable self-driving, Einride notes that it also can be driven remotely, giving it additional capabilities that current autonomous driving tech can’t manage (existing automated transport truck tech requires human drivers to take over once the vehicles leave the highway).
Einride plans to start testing the T-Pod this year, so this also isn’t a tremendously far-flung future innovation. The plan is to follow testing with international distribution, and to help develop an infrastructure of charging stations that can help the T-Pods extend their active range and complete longer routes.

The 7 meter (23 foot)-long T-Pod has a total weight of 20 tons when loaded down fully with cargo, which is smaller than most transport trucks. But platooning the vehicles can replicate the transport power of larger vehicles, while keeping range and efficiency at their best. Also, because the vehicles are designed to be remotely piloted, they don’t incur additional idle work time for drivers while they’re stopped and recharging.
Einride says it hopes to get the T-Pods into active service with a total fleet size of around 200 vehicles by 2020, which is ambitious given its relative youth. But the idea definitely has a lot of merit, and all the fundamental tech pieces appear to be in place to ke this possible.

410,Carjojo uses natural language to find a new car,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/06/carjojo-uses-natural-language-to-find-a-new-car/,2017/04/06,"
Carjojo’s latest update brings some big changes to its Edge2Edge machine learning technology. The service has allowed users to search for and buy a new car since going live in November 2016, but new features make it easier to search every. single. car. on dealership lots right now — about 4 million on any given day, according to the Carjojo press release.
The first improvement is natural language processing, which allows users to search via voice recognition or typing in text. Carjojo will autocomplete the search with makes and models then show you every match in your area. Carjojo doesn’t rely on dealers to input their inventory into its system — it just searches the entire internet, Google style. So you see every relevant car, not just the vehicles dealers pay to put into a proprietary system.
Carjojo adds color coding to each car in the search results so the user can see how long the car has been on the lot, how many similar cars are available in the area, and more — all things that will affect negotiations for the lowest price. It also calculates anything that could cut the price, from special offers to military rebates. If those apply to you, all the better.
All of this results in Carjojo’s Guaranteed Best Price, which you can walk into a dealership and negotiate. If that’s not your thing, though, you can pay Carjojo $199 to negotiate with the dealership for that Guaranteed Best Price. Then you just have to sign the interminable stacks of paper required for buying a car at the dealership. (Why, dealerships, why, in the twenty-first century, are you still so paper-based?) If you use Carjojo to find a car and do all the negotiating on your own, the service is free.
Carjojo is not the only car-buying app on the block. Wype launched in spring 2016, bringing Tinder-style swiping to car searches. Deliver My Ride builds a $500 per transaction fee into its car buying service, but users never have to set foot in a dealership. It doesn’t always work out, though, as peer-to-peer car-buying app Beepi found out last fall.
Carjojo, which is based in Silicon Valley, was founded by Peter Levy, who is no stranger to automotive metrics. In the dark ages of the 1980s, he founded IntelliChoice, which in 1987 began handing out the Best Overall Value of the Year awards to vehicles. IntelliChoice is now part of Motor Trend Automotive Group.

411,Uber responds to the New York Times article about how it psychologically manipulates drivers,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/05/uber-responds-to-the-new-york-times-article-about-how-it-psychologically-manipulates-drivers/,2017/04/05,"
Uber is on the defensive after the New York Times reported that it manipulates drivers using techniques from behavioral science in order to reduce costs and increase corporate growth. The company did not refute that it uses psychological incentives, but instead focused its response on a claim in the April 2 article that “faster pickup times for riders require a greater percentage to be idling unpaid.”
“This is simply not true—and had the Times asked us whether it was, we would have explained the reality of what happens when Uber grows in a city: riders enjoy lower pick-up times and drivers benefit from less downtime between trips,” Uber’s director of policy research, Betsy Masiello, wrote in a blog post.
In order to avoid long wait times for customers and surge pricing (which automatically kicks in when demand for rides is higher than usual in an area), Uber has to make sure enough of its drivers are working—and does so using techniques that are sometimes ethically questionable, the New York Times said.
The article claimed that Uber “engaged in an extraordinary behind-the-scenes experiment in behavioral science to manipulate them in the service of its corporate growth—an effort whose dimensions became evident in interviews with several dozen current and former Uber officials, drivers and social scientists, as well as a review of behavioral science.”
According to the article, Uber’s tactics are similar to ones used by video game designers and have included:

alerting drivers when they are close to reaching an earnings goal set by the app.
rewarding drivers with in-app badges that do not necessarily translate into higher earnings.
a feature that automatically alerts Uber drivers about their next potential fare before they drop off their current customer and can’t be turned off, only paused.
male local managers pretending to be women when texting drivers to head to certain areas, after finding that female personas increased engagement.

Even though drivers can decide when they want to work, Uber’s techniques are potentially problematic because they can manipulate drivers into working longer hours or undesirable locations without guaranteeing higher income, while benefiting the company’s bottom line.
Furthermore, because Uber’s drivers are contractors, they lack the protections and benefits that employees get, and are therefore more vulnerable to exploitation.
Masiello writes, however, that Uber’s practices have actually resulted in less idle time for its drivers:
First, as the number of passengers and drivers using Uber grows, any individual driver is more likely to be close to a rider. This means shorter pickup times and more time spent with a paying passenger in the back of the car. In addition, new features like uberPOOL and Back-to-Back trips have meant longer trips, while incentives to drive during the busiest times and in the busiest locations help keep drivers earning for a greater share of their time online. And that should be no surprise: drivers are our customers just as much as riders. So although the Times article suggests that Uber’s interest is misaligned with drivers’, the opposite is true: it’s in our interest to ensure that drivers have a paying passenger as often as possible because they’re more likely to keep using our app to earn money. (And Uber doesn’t earn money until drivers do.)
Though other tech companies, like Lyft and Postmates, use similar tactics to get more work out of their contractors, the New York Times article comes at an especially bad time for Uber. The company has never been viewed as a paragon of good corporate practice, but its reputation has arguably reached an all-time low over the past few months after a deluge of PR crises.
These include the revelation that it used a software tool called “greyball” to prevent regulators from taking rides, the #deleteuber social media campaign, reports of rampant sexual harassment, a video of founder and CEO Travis Kalanick berating a driver who was upset about dropping fares (Kalanick later apologized and promised to seek “leadership help”) and its ongoing court battle with Waymo, which claims Uber stole trade secrets.

GM’s car sharing brand has expanded to another U.S. city – Baltimore, Maryland. The new city will offer 20 pick-up points and 40 vehicles across the downtown area, with rental rates starting around $8 per hour, including gas, and without requiring any regular membership fees. The Maven fleet includes Chevy Cruze and Cruze Hatchback, as well as Malibu, Tahoe and the GMC Acadia, all of which offer top-end trim in terms of options, along with SiriusXM and OnStar functionality.
Maven now spans 17 cities across the U.S. and Canada, and offers daily booking options as well. Cars also include Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as standard options, something that’s still notably lacking among traditional rental fleets. In addition to its car-sharing services, which work much like Zipcar, Maven also runs campus-based car sharing services in select locations, and short-term car rentals for ride hailing services like Uber. It’s also trying different approaches to different markets with its basic offering, as demonstrated by its decision to field a fleet of electric Chevrolet Bolts in LA.

413,Uber finds one allegedly stolen Waymo file – on an employee’s personal device,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/05/uber-finds-one-allegedly-stolen-waymo-file-on-an-employees-personal-device/,2017/04/05,"
Uber admitted today that it had found one of the documents Waymo alleges was stolen by a former employee — who left its self-driving car effort to join Uber’s — on the employee’s personal computer.
The document was found on a personal device belonging to Sameer Kshirsagar, Uber’s attorney Arturo Gonzalez said at a court hearing today. It’s the first time that Uber has acknowledged that any of Waymo’s documents are in the possession of any Uber employees. However, Uber emphasized that the document was not found on Uber’s computers. “We did collect documents from him and thus far we have only found one document from his computers that matches the documents identified in the complaint,” Gonzalez said.
Waymo claims that Kshirsagar downloaded several confidential documents in June 2016, one month before resigning and joining Anthony Levandowski at Uber. The names of the five specific documents are partially redacted in court filings, but one references “laser questions” and another “lens placement.”
Levandowski is one of three Uber employees accused of taking Waymo trade secrets, and Waymo says he took 14,000 documents, while Kshirsagar and Radu Raduta took only a few. Waymo is now asking for Uber to turn over those stolen documents as part of the discovery process in its trade secret lawsuit against its competitor, while Uber argues that it cannot hand over anything from Levandowski without violating his Fifth Amendment rights and that it has already thoroughly searched for the documents at Uber.
Uber said it has interviewed 85 current and former employees, 42 of whom worked in the automotive division. Uber searched 10 of the employees’ computers and looked through the company’s git repository for files that matched Waymo’s descriptions. The company found 31,000 hits but described them as “not substantive.”
“I believe that we will demonstrate to you that those 14,000 files never made it to Uber,” Gonzalez said.
Waymo claimed in a letter to the court that Uber did not meet the deadline to hand over documents and refused to provide all of the documents Waymo had requested, particularly the 14,000 confidential Waymo documents Levandowski allegedly downloaded before he left the company to lead Uber’s self-driving car unit.

Judge criticizes Uber's secrecy in lawsuit with Waymo


 “To the extent Uber tries to excuse its noncompliance on the grounds that Mr. Levandowski has invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to provide Uber with documents or assistance, Waymo notes that Mr. Levandowski remains — to this day — an Uber executive and in charge of its self-driving car program. Uber has ratified Mr. Levandowski’s behavior and is liable for it,” Waymo attorney Charles K. Verhoeven wrote in a letter to the court (emphasis his).
Judge William Alsup, who is presiding over the case, ordered Uber to search more thoroughly for the documents. He told Uber to search using 15 terms provided by Waymo, first on the employees’ computers that had already been searched, then on 10 employees’ computers selected by Waymo, and then on all other servers and devices connected to employees who work on Uber’s LiDAR system.

414,London self-driving shuttle test aims to get people comfortable with the tech,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/05/london-self-driving-shuttle-test-aims-to-get-people-comfortable-with-the-tech/,2017/04/05,"
A self-driving shuttle will ferry around 100 people in Greenwich, London along a short route on a public cycle and pedestrian path over the next three weeks, in a trial using Oxbotica’s driverless vehicle technology. The goal, according to Oxbotica, is to show average people that they can safely share space with autonomous cars, helping dissuade any perception of threat and generally improve comfort levels ahead of a planned wider launch with regular service available tot he public.
Oxbotica already kicked off self-driving car trials on UK streets in Milton Keynes late last year. The shuttle it’s using for this test is a very different vehicle, with room for four passengers and a much slower top speed, which suits its route along the Olympian Way path near O2 arena. Its design is focused on providing safe transport in an environment where it has to contend regularly with pedestrians crossing its path, and it’s 328 foot forward vision system is designed to help it come to a steady, comfortable stop whenever it sees something interrupting its path.
Part of Oxbotica’s goal with this limited trial is also to find out how passengers onboard the shuttle react to the experience of being transported by a computer-driver system. That could help inform design aspects of the rider experience, including driving practices and interior design. Ultimately, the goal is to begin a more comprehensive trial by 2019 in Greenwich, with the aim of rolling it out beyond to other locales further down the road.
Shuttles are low-hanging fruit for autonomous vehicle tech: routes are regular and relatively predictable, and speed isn’t necessarily a high-value target. This trial has interesting implications in terms of how closely it shares space with passengers and cyclists, a key area of concern for autonomous tech overall.

415,"Tesla now worth more than GM, making it the most valuable U.S. automaker",https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/04/tesla-now-worth-more-than-gm-making-it-the-most-valuable-u-s-automaker/,2017/04/04,"
Tesla is trading up again today, after a strong run yesterday that saw its total market cap value leapfrog Ford’s. It passed GM’s market cap on Tuesday, meaning it’s now the most valuable U.S. automaker as measured by the stock market’s standards.
It looked quite likely that this was going to happen yesterday, and Tesla’s stock has been on a tear following its report that both car production and car deliveries were up during the first quarter of the year. The big established U.S. automakers, by contrast, had bad news to report for first quarter vehicle sales in the U.S., which makes Tesla look like a strong growth stock and competitors look like stable performers, at best.
Tesla’s stock is buoyed in large part by its potential: The company has been readying to launch its Model 3 electric vehicle, with a price tag starting at $35,000 U.S. before tax incentives for green vehicles. Demand is incredibly strong, with around 373,000 pre-orders as of May last year. So far, it seems on target to meet its goal of beginning shipment this year, and even delivering some of the first vehicles by the end of 2017.
Tesla was trading up around 1.8 percent as of this writing, with a stock price of $303.89 per share and a total market cap of $53.06 billion, while GM was tracking at around $34.40 per share, with a total market cap of $49.80 billion.

416,Infiniti launches a startup lab in Toronto to focus on IoT and smart cities,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/04/infiniti-launches-a-startup-lab-in-toronto-to-focus-on-iot-and-smart-cities/,2017/04/04,"
Nissan’s upscale auto brand Infiniti is putting down startup roots in Canada with a new accelerator designed to help spur growth of companies that focus on internet-of-things and smart city technology. The new Infiniti Lab follows the model of the debut Lab launched by the carmaker in Hong Kong in 2015, and is the first Lab in North America, as well as Canada’s first carmaker-backed startup accelerator.
Infiniti is teaming up with Multiplicity to get the Toronto Lab up and running, and selected Toronto because of its strong startup culture, according to the company. Multiplicity is a non-profit based in the city that offers education and mentorship services to startups and entrepreneurs. It’s a good way to get boots on the ground in a new market, tapping into someone already plugged into the local scene that can help direct Infiniti’s resources to help the automaker best achieve its goal of spotting and fostering talent.
Already, Infiniti Lab has completed two cohorts of startups via its Hong Kong accelerator, and it’s hoping to keep up the pace with its new Toronto location. It’s open to companies who are very early, prior to even accepting seed funding, who are looking at solving problems related to connected devices and smart cities. The participants in the Toronto program, which is open for applications now, will undergo a 30-day program in Mutiplicity’s coworking space, and then they’ll have a pitch day presenting to investors including Techstars, OMERS Ventures, TELUS Ventures and the City of Toronto. A winner will then be selected and fast-tracked to the more intensive three-month program in Hong Kong.
Infiniti isn’t alone among automakers in trying to do more to accelerate the pace of connected city innovation, nor is it alone in fostering startup growth as a means to do so. Honda’s Xcelerator is another example of an automaker accelerator program, albeit one that works with startups across all stages of their growth and funding.
I asked Infiniti Canada Managing Director Stephen Lester about the motivations behind the program, and he said that it’s a mix that includes the potential to spot talent and partners, but that it’s really about alignment between Infiniti’s brand and entrepreneurial values.
“What it comes back to at the end of the day is that Infiniti as a brand is really focused on human daring, and especially that forward-thinking element,” Lester said. “Those are two key areas for us where we really think entrepreneurship is very strongly tied or linked to our brand. So not just to the people that participate in lab, but to the stories behind them, and to the opportunities then to understand how their successes and triumphs and focus and vision mirror what Infiniti is trying to do as a brand.”
Startups can apply to the program starting today, and the program will kick off on May 29, beginning that one month sprint prior to demo day.

417,Daimler and Bosch: fully autonomous cars within 5 years,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/04/daimler-and-bosch-fully-autonomous-cars-within-5-years/,2017/04/04,"
Look out, startups. The big guns are taking on autonomous driving with serious intent. Daimler, one of the largest vehicle manufacturers in the world, announced that it is partnering with Bosch, one of the largest automotive tech and hardware suppliers in the world, to bring fully autonomous vehicles to urban roads “by the start of the next decade.”
It’s already 2017, so the start of the next decade is not quite three years away. But with the resources available to the Daimler-Bosch partnership, they plan on co-developing vehicles capable of SAE Level 4 fully automated driving and SAE Level 5 driverless operation. The focus of the partnership will be on the software and algorithms required to make those advanced driving systems safe and predictable.
According to press releases from both companies, the goal is to create shared cars that can operate autonomously within designated areas of a city. The user can call the car via app, ride without a driver, and be dropped off, leaving the driverless car to pick up another customer. The companies hope to both ease traffic and improve accessibility for those who can’t drive or don’t have a driver’s license.
Of course, other ride hailing companies are already headed down this driverless road, most notably Uber. But Uber and Daimler formed a partnership in early 2017 to develop self-driving cars. And Mercedes-Benz, which is under the Daimler umbrella, has been showcasing fully autonomous concept cars at auto shows in recent years.
But in an interesting side note, the head of the Mercedes-Benz Cars R&D validation and testing, Jochen Haab, said in an interview over the weekend that a “driverless taxi”-type situation was “at least a decade away.” Haab was in Australia overseeing an autonomous driving pilot project–one that may move a bit more quickly now.

418,Ford tops the list of automated driving leaders in new study,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/03/ford-tops-the-list-of-automated-driving-leaders-in-new-study/,2017/04/03,"
Autonomous driving might seem like the province of startups and Silicon Valley, but a new independent research report from Navigant shows automaker Ford at the head of the pack when it comes to self-driving tech. The annual survey looked at 18 different companies, smeared across 10 different criteria, ranging from strategy, to core tech development, to manufacturing capability and staying power, and a company that’s over 100 years old ended up leading the list.
The Navigant list also included GM among the very top tier of companies with potential in the world of autonomous driving, which is a win for startups tangentially since that company picked up Cruise Automation to help boost its autonomous technology program. GM leads on execution, according to Navigant’s rating system, but Ford’s edge on Strategy gives it the overall claim to the top spot. Others in the leader category include the Renault-Nissan mashup and Daimler, with Waymo, Tesla, Delphi and others occupying a lower, Contender tier, and Uber, Baidu, nuTonomy and Honda ranking lower still in a group called “Challengers.”
Ford has already responded to their position in the study, with a Medium post from CTO Raj Nair expressing their satisfaction at being ranked number one. Nair writes that Ford especially values this recognition because of Navigant’s methodology, which looks at factors beyond just sensor hardware and software systems development in producing its ranking.
Nair talks about how Ford’s ability to actually make cars, and make them at scale, is a distinguishing advantage, and its mobility services approach, and subsidiary company, which will see autonomous vehicles launched first in ride-hailing and delivery fleets.
Ford’s investment and M&A strategy is another reason Navigant cites for its ranking in the study. During the past year, Ford has invested in Civil Maps, Velodyne, and autonomous AI startup Argo – plus it acquired Chariot, and algorithmic platform startup SAIPS. These combine with its existing industry expertise for potential in the market that outstrips its more tech-focused competitors, according to the report.

419,"According to the stock market, Tesla is now worth more than Ford",https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/03/according-to-the-stock-market-tesla-is-now-worth-more-than-ford/,2017/04/03,"
Tesla’s market capitalization is now higher than Ford’s.
Tesla is trading up on the day, sending its market cap to $47.46 billion. And then there’s Ford, the blue chip automaker that’s exactly 100 years older than Tesla, which is trading down on the day, causing its market cap to dip to $44.89 billion. General Motors’ market cap is only a stone’s throw away at $51 billion.
This fluctuation in valuation comes on the back of Tesla reporting good news and Ford reporting bad news. Tesla saw vehicle production and deliveries rise during the first quarter of the year at a pace that beat analysts’ expectations. Meanwhile, Ford is recalling some of its F-150 pickup trucks and its U.S. monthly sales fell 7 percent during last month.
Tesla’s stock has been steadily gaining value since the latter weeks of 2016. It’s now trading at an all-time high of $291.54, up from $181 in the early days of December 2016. But the stock price only shows part of the picture.
Tesla is in deep debt and only shipped some 76,000 vehicles last year. Other automakers, like Ford, ship millions of cars each year and have a more healthy balance sheet with annual revenues and profits that far eclipse that of the 13-year-old startup. Tesla’s strength comes from its sales pitch of delivering the best possible electric vehicles. Investors are clearly hopeful that Tesla will become a key part of the automotive future.

420,Uber’s Anthony Levandowski invokes Fifth Amendment rights in Waymo suit,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/30/ubers-anthony-levandowski-invokes-fifth-amendment-rights-in-waymo-suit/,2017/03/30,"
Uber executive and Otto co-founder Anthony Levandowski is asserting his Fifth Amendment rights in regard to a lawsuit filed by Waymo against Uber, which accuses the company and Levandowski of stealing technology related to autonomous vehicles from the Google self-driving car project prior to his departure. A lawyer for Levandowski told the court that the engineer would exercise his Fifth Amendment rights broadly because there exists “potential for criminal action” which could lead to self-incrimination, as reported by The New York Times.
In court transcripts from a Thursday hearing reviewed by TechCrunch, Levandowski’s lawyer invokes the amendment in what appears to be a precaution related to a document release by Uber. Uber’s lawyers claim that the company doesn’t have the documents Levandowski allegedly stole from Waymo and therefore won’t be handing them over tomorrow as part of a scheduled document production.
“We’re broadly asserting Mr. Levandowski’s Fifth Amendment rights as to any documents he may possess and control that are of relevance to this action,” a lawyer for Levandowski told the court. Levandowski’s assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege could change, however, as the case moves forward.
Levandowski’s acknowledgement of his potential criminal liability is another interesting turn in what has been a dramatic court proceeding thus far between the two companies. Waymo claims that Levandowski stole thousands of confidential documents from the company (when it was still Google’s self-driving car project, during which time Levandowski was employed there), and then took steps to cover up the theft.
So far, Uber has focused its defense on questioning why Waymo has not handled this apparent violation of Levandowski’s employment agreement via arbitration, which is the means it contractually requires for dealing with disputes with employees. It was revealed earlier this week that Waymo did indeed pursue arbitration against Levandowski in October, prior to filing suit against his employer this February. That action focused on accusations of employee poaching, however, and left out the claims of proprietary information theft, which Uber says should also be subject to arbitration.
Although Uber has worked to distance itself from Levandowski, Judge William Alsup indicated during the hearing that he was inclined to stop Uber from using any technology copied from Google as the case progresses.
“Some of the things in your motion are bogus. You’ve got things in there like lists of suppliers as trade secrets. Come on. It undermines the whole thing,” he told Waymo, according to the transcript. However, Judge Alsup also warned Uber about the gravity of Waymo’s allegations. “There are some things in that motion that are very serious. They are genuine trade secrets. And if you don’t come in with a denial, you’re probably looking at a preliminary injunction,” he told Uber.
“If his truck driving company gets shut down because of theft of trade secrets on a record that he’s not willing to deny, too bad for him. Too bad. Listen, I’m not sympathetic to it. You represent somebody who’s in a mess,” Alsup told Levandowski’s attorney.
Judge Alsup had previously criticized Uber for making heavy redactions of documents it submitted to the court relevant to the case. (Uber later claimed that Waymo had asked for the redactions.)
Uber Associate General Counsel Angela Padilla provided the following statement regarding the case, when we contacted the company for response:
We look forward to our first public response laying out our case on Friday, April 7. We are very confident that Waymo’s claims against Uber are baseless and that Anthony Levandowski has not used any files from Google in his work with Otto or Uber.

421,RydenGo gets ready to take on Lyft and Uber,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/30/rydengo-gets-ready-to-take-on-lyft-and-uber/,2017/03/30,"
RydenGo is cooking up a new model for ride hailing. Rather than taking a commission, RydenGo will charge drivers a flat $20 per month subscription fee. The driver keeps the fare they charge and any tips they earn.
The fare is key to RydenGo’s model. When a user requests a ride via app, drivers in the area respond with a rate for the ride that they set themselves rather than having rates set by the company. The user can then choose which ride to accept.
RydenGo also hopes to improve safety in ride hailing by using a four-digit verification code to lessen the chances that a passenger will get into the wrong vehicle. The company conducts the usual background checks on drivers, and they require verification with a RydenGo representative in person or via phone. It also promises to conduct random background checks on drivers “if necessary as determined by its internal security monitoring system,” according to a press release.
It’s free (for now) for drivers to sign up for the beta program that’s already in place in nearly two dozen U.S. cities. Founder Michael Pappas hopes to have the service, which is based in Newport Beach, CA, up and running this fall. Pappas told the LA Times that he comes from a pro-union background and believes that a company can be profitable without exploiting its workers.
There are other facets of ridesharing and car sharing in the works at RydenGo once the basics are in place, like a social function for arranging carpools and a “playground” where you can hire, say, a vintage fire truck for an event. As Pappas said in the press release, “Why can’t changing the world be fun?”

422,Ford taps BlackBerry talent to double its in-house mobile engineering team,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/30/ford-taps-blackberry-talent-to-double-its-in-house-mobile-engineering-team/,2017/03/30,"
Ford has made 400 new engineering hires, the company announced, and will create a new Research and Engineering Centre in Ottawa (yes, it’s a ‘centre’ because it’s Canadian). The majority of the hires come from BlackBerry, where they have extensive experience working with QNX, the operating systems that powers Ford’s SYNC 3, and is used by a large number of the world’s leading automakers in similar capacities.
The new hires more than double Ford’s existing team of engineers focused on mobility and connectivity, and essentially mean that Ford now has a larger group dedicated to this area than do many smartphone makers, as pointed out to me by Ford’s Global Director for Electrical and Electronic Systems Engineering Chuck Gray.
So what does a focus on mobility and connectivity entail for this new cadre of Ford engineers, exactly? Well, autonomous vehicles are one aspect, but the more immediate concerns for the group will be working on specific elements of in-car connectivity, device-to-device communication and network technology that will eventually prove very useful in fielding the first generation of consumer self-driving cars.
“In order to have autonomy, the vehicle’s got to be connected, it’s just fundamental,” Gray explained. “The vehicle itself, whether there’s a driver or not, has to be communicating with the cloud for various reasons, so this group immediately is working on creating that connectivity spine or network upon which everything else can be built.”
“The majority [of hires from this announcement] are from BlackBerry,” he said, regarding the decision to place their new facility in Ottawa and the talent they’re drawing for the majority of this group of new employees. “Obviously they have deep skills, in embedded software, in mobile devices, in connectivity, and when you look at the subsets of products they work in – they work in RF, they work hardware, they work at the chip level, they work in operating systems, they have a renowned reputation for security and stability […] so it was a really good fit.”
Projects the group will focus on include in-car connectivity, as mentioned, as well as advanced driver assist features. The work of the group will also take place in additional engineering centers in Waterloo and Oakville in Canada, as well as North Carolina and Florida in the U.S. It’s also reasonable to expect the company’s investment in this area to grow over time, as it takes on an increasingly important role to automakers in general.
Gray says that the company set its sights on “really having full control over the software that shapes” much of a driver’s experience in the car, and sought out a talent pool that could support these ambitions, which led it to Canada’s automotive systems engineering hub in Ottawa, where BlackBerry’s QNX is based. Gray added that a focus on its own mobility engineering would help undergird revenue potential resulting from connected vehicles, as well as provide added potential for customers over the lifetime of their cars via convenience features like over-the-air software updates.
Data is the key for carmakers in the modern market, and making sure you have an internal organization that can effectively own in-car software and connectivity services will be key to keeping ahead in that race, especially as the industry moves towards autonomous cars and more free time for in-car activity.

423,Audi to acquire rental provider Silvercar to expand its mobility services,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/30/audi-to-acquire-rental-provider-silvercar-to-expand-its-mobility-services/,2017/03/30,"
Audi plans to acquire Silvercar, a U.S.-based car sharing startup that was founded specifically to address the high-end airport rental car market. The company’s fleet is already made up exclusively of Audi A4 cars, so it’s not exactly going to be a dramatic upheaval in terms of Silvercar’s offering.
Audi also already has a minority stake in the company, since an investment it made in the smaller company back in 2015. Austin-based Silvercar has also boosted its North American presence to 15 different airport locations since that investment, and the goal of the acquisition is not only to continue to grow Silvercar’s core operations, according to Audi, but also to expand Audi’s mobility services offerings in the U.S. market in general.
Already, Audi offers Audi on Demand in certain markets in the U.S., which provides white glove short-term rentals to travelers on-demand. The pickup of Silvercar, which has around 150 employees based in its Texas HQ, seems to be Audi’s shortcut for accelerating those mobility plans, and possibly also for giving them a central brand around which to coalesce.

424,Uber adds post-request pickup fixes and more driver-side support,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/30/uber-adds-post-request-pickup-fixes-and-more-driver-side-support/,2017/03/30,"
Uber talked about a few of the changes coming to help improve its relationship with drivers during a press call last week held to address a number of concerns, including regarding its leadership and culture. Now, it’s releasing a few of those features it discussed, including pickup corrections users can make after they’ve already booked a driver, and a number of new customer support options drivers can take advantage of across a range of different areas.
Pickup modifications seem like an easy win for Uber in terms of user experience on both rider and driver sides of the equation. This change, which is going out first to the Uber app in the U.S., U.K. and Canada that allows riders to change their pickup location after they’ve made a booking, means that when you screw up and request a ride from a place where you actually are not present you can make a change without having to cancel the whole trip and start again. This has happened to me more than a few times, so I’m glad to see it rolling out to help minimize confusion.
The customer support changes for drivers were also discussed broadly on the call, and basically include giving drivers more credit when it comes to issues including complaints from riders, reports of drivers not being who they say they are, reports that rides have been intercepted by someone other than the person who requested them and, in the case of fare adjustment, requests from riders.
In most of these cases, Uber has previously sided with riders almost exclusively, trusting their claims without much regard for the driver’s side of the story. Now, Uber will take into account a driver’s full record when measuring the validity of rider complaints. It’ll also use its Real Time ID and other shortcuts when reports of mismatched driver identity crop up, so that riders mistakenly identified as someone other than who they claim to be can get back to driving more quickly.
Cases where a rider claimed that someone else grabbed their ride while they were charged will now be open to investigation by Uber, using “technology” as well as driver input to figure out what actually happened, too. And finally, when riders cancel their trip mid-ride, drivers can challenge being short-changed on fare, and get compensated for the full trip in cases where they continue to finish the ride regardless.
Uber says this is just the start in terms of changes it’s making regarding its customer support practices, with more to follow over the next few weeks and months. All of this is part of an effort Uber’s head of U.S. and Canada Rachel Holt said is deigned to repair “frayed” relations with its driver community.

425,Toyota Research Institute puts $35M into AI-powered materials research,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/30/toyota-research-institute-puts-35m-into-ai-powered-materials-research/,2017/03/30,"
Toyota’s dedicated research organization, Toyota Research Institute (TRI), is investing $35 million into collaborative research efforts with a number of university and corporate partners focused on materials science. TRI believes progress in artificial intelligence can help further efforts in this key area of basic research, specifically around three key areas, including fuel cell catalysts, batteries and functional polymers designed for energy storage.
The key through line here is that TRI’s interest in materials science ties directly to exploration of making progress in the realm of energy use. This has long been a key roadblock when its comes to various areas of technology, and that’s true also of TRI’s other areas of research interest, which include robotics (and domestic robotics specifically) as well as autonomous vehicles.
But TRI’s Chief Science Officer Eric Krotkov told me in an interview that while it’s eager to begin this work and get excited about the potential of its new partnerships, this is likely the longest bet that TRI is making in terms of its various areas of focus.
“What we’re doing now with our research partners and internally at TRI is not going to go into the Mirai next year,” Krotkov said. “This is a long-term project addressing some very fundamental scientific questions and we’re going to be publishing articles in scientific journals and trying to reproduce some of the results that the various partners achieve, and just applying the scientific method. This is a long-term project.”
TRI’s entire purpose is to apply the potential of AI to difficult problems, however, and it’s not after quick fixes. Still, it hopes that use of AI in this particular realm can help create efficiencies in certain areas that will expedite parts of the process, which generally occur on very long time scales, including a lot of fundamental experimentation, vetting and attempts to replicate experimental results. I asked how AI might help with this, and whether simulation of experiments was a key component.
“Simulation in general is a great tool for doing science and engineering,” explained Dr. Brian Storey, an Olin College of Engineering professor and TRI team member. “There are fundamental reasons that it’s very, very difficult to do it in some of these problems. You can’t make a simulator for an entire battery. Can you do better than we currently do? We think so. Simulation is important, but it can’t be the whole thing. It’s really the integration, but also new sources of experimental data but really bringing these things together is the critical part.”
TRI research partner Ilika has conducted plenty of research on fuel cell catalyst and solid state battery materials.
Along with research partners including Stanford, MIT, the University of Michigan, the University at Buffalo, the University of Connecticut and UK materials science company Ilika (which also has a longstanding working relationship with Toyota), TRI hopes to marry material modelling on computers with a wider range of available data from past experiments. It’l weave these together with machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques for sifting and combining the available information, with the end goal of helping design and develop new materials that have potential in the field of energy storage and power production it’s most interested in.
What Krotkov says is most interesting about TRI’s specific approach to these partnerships, and what sets this apart from other similar private funding efforts directed at academic institutions, is that this isn’t a competition designed to narrow the field over time. Most grant-style programs offered by companies like Toyota start with a fairly wide group of participants, but set in advance the expectation that this group will decrease over time, with “winners” emerging over “losers” as measured by progress.
TRI purposefully avoided this kind of construction with this program, hoping to foster more cross-collaboration among peers and different groups working on the same problem. Already, Krotkov says he’s seen enthusiasm and encouraging signs among their research partners that this is paying off, and avoiding the kind of information and results-hoarding that can arise as a natural outcome of the model where everyone knows they’re directly competing for resources down the road.
For TRI, this is an investment that will hopefully produce results in a relatively distant future, which is why structuring its partnerships like this also makes sense: true collaboration isn’t achieved over the span of a semester or an academic school year. Toyota’s AI research wing once again stands out as an example of long-term planning in an industry that loves short-term marketing wins, which is a marked distinction in automotive tech today.

The latest Tesla software update brings anticipated new features to Autopilot 2.0 cars, including Summon, which calls your car to you from its parking spot – but it also has a lighter side, as Tesla software updates tend to.
Tesla added a new Easter Egg (a goofy software gag generally slightly hidden from view) to its vehicles with the 8.1 update, and this time it’s a sketch pad. The 17-inch touchscreen that dominates the Tesla Model S center panel is basically already a huge digital surface primed for drawing, so it’s a natural add-on – not counting that most of the time you’re going to be using the screen while driving, of course.

The choice of subject is excellent, depicting the true power source of the Tesla Model S, and it clearly impressed Elon Musk: The Tesla CEO tweeted this image, along with a rudimentary Mona Lisa, when he revealed the nature of the new Easter Egg himself.
I really do love drawing, and I was saving up for a $3,000 Surface Studio to help indulge that hobby. Maybe I’ll just save up an additional $97,000 or so and get a Tesla instead, since I also like driving –two birds, one stone.

427,Waymo pursued arbitration with Anthony Levandowski before it sued Uber,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/29/waymo-pursued-arbitration-with-anthony-levandowski-before-it-sued-uber/,2017/03/29,"
Google’s self-driving car unit, Waymo, pursued arbitration against one of its star engineers last fall before filing a lawsuit in February against his current employer, Uber, for theft of trade secrets.
Waymo claims that its former employee Anthony Levandowski stole 14,000 confidential documents before leaving to start the self-driving truck company Otto, which was acquired by Uber shortly after emerging from stealth. Waymo also claims that Uber and Levandowski copied its designs for its LiDAR sensors, a core feature of its self-driving technology.
Uber’s lawyers have been pushing back on the claims over the past several weeks, questioning why Waymo isn’t suing Levandowski instead and saying that the most salacious claims of the lawsuit should be moot based on the binding arbitration clauses in Levandowski’s employment contract with Google.
It turns out that Waymo did bring legal action against Levandowski back in October, according to a document filed by Uber’s attorneys today. In the arbitration demands, Waymo focused on Levandowski’s efforts to poach employees from Google, saying that he “improperly used Waymo’s confidential information to induce Waymo employees to join a competing driverless-car enterprise” and used confidential salary information learned at Waymo to make targeted salary offers. (In its lawsuit against Uber, Waymo claims that two other employees stole confidential documents in their final days at the company before joining Uber’s team.)
However, Waymo’s allegations of trade-secret theft weren’t included in the arbitration actions — and Uber is arguing that they should be. Of course, this would get Uber out of most of the claims in what’s shaping up to be a costly and reputation-damaging legal battle. The patent infringement claims would continue.
“Waymo asserts no claims for trade secret misappropriation in those arbitrations. Waymo’s purpose for proceeding in this curious manner seems clear: through artful pleading, it hopes to avoid arbitrating the misappropriation and UCL claims at all costs,” Uber’s attorney argues.
The two self-driving titans are due in court in early May.

428,Tesla’s 8.1 software update brings Autopilot 2.0 cars up to speed,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/29/teslas-8-1-software-update-brings-autopilot-2-0-cars-up-to-speed/,2017/03/29,"
Tesla is releasing new 8.1 software out to vehicles, which includes updates to Autopilot for hardware that supports version 2.0 of the advanced driver assistance features. These late model cars are getting features that bring it basically up to parity with the original, first generation software, Electrek reports, which means a speed limit bump for Autosteer, a beta introduction of the Summon feature, and automatic lane changing while Autosteer is engaged.
The Autospeed speed limit boost in this update for Autopilot 2.0 cars is up to 80 mph, up from a hard cap of 55 before. It’ll automatically calibrate itself first, so you’ll still be limited to 55 for a few days of highway driving. The Summon feature, which lets users call their vehicles from parking spaces without anyone behind the wheel, is added as a beta as mentioned, and there’s the lane change feature, which allows you to just flick the turn signal on to have the car initiate a lane change while in Autosteer mode when the way is clear.
These features haven’t been available on Autopilot 2.0-capable vehicles, which employ brand new sensor and onboard computing hardware incorporated into existing vehicle designs by Tesla late last year. The new equipment means these cars will eventually be able to run in full autonomous driving mode, allowing the driver to sit back and relax while the vehicle takes them wherever they want to go.
That kind of feature is still a relatively distant vision – Tesla CEO Elon Musk said last year that he hopes to do a first cross-country test drive of a fully autonomous Tesla car by the end of 2017, and that means a broad release will follow some significant amount of time later. But in the meantime, Tesla has had to rebuild its existing autopilot features, too, focusing on re-engineering the software for its own in-house ‘Tesla Vision’ image processing.

Mercedes-Benz had already committed to launch 10 new electric vehicle models within the next decade, but now it’s looking to launch them by 2022, which is at least three years earlier than it had previously discussed. Mercedes sees the shift to electric as a more urgent one than it anticipated, and wants to lead, rather than follow as the industry makes this shift.
Bloomberg reports that Daimler-owned Mercedes-Benz will put over $10 billion into its effort to bring the new vehicles to market, and that the transition will require “fundamental” changes at the automaker according to Daimler Chairman Manfred Bischoff, who discussed the revised timeline at a company shareholder meeting in Berlin on Wednesday.
Emissions pressures are one cause, as Daimler has been affected by the diesel’s fallout among automakers after the Volkswagen scandal. The electrification efforts also help with long-term goals, including fielding reliable autonomous vehicles and fleets. Daimler’s multiple mobility service initiatives include car2go, Moovel and Mytaxi, all of whose models would benefit from improvements in EV range and affordability.

430,We could find out more about the mysterious Tesla ‘Model Y’ next week,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/28/we-could-find-out-more-about-the-mysterious-tesla-model-y-next-week/,2017/03/28,"
Tesla has long teased a Model Y, or fourth production car for its lineup, which will be another SUV, this time a compact likely with a more attractive and generally palatable price point. The Model Y fits with Tesla’s schoolyard humor name scheme, bringing the “S3X” model lineup to its natural, “S3XY” conclusion. Now, it looks like we could learn more about the Y shortly.
While Musk replied publicly to a tweet from a fan that we’re not likely to see a Y for “a few years” yet, Musk noted in a direct message to Ars Technica (via Elecktrek) that “Next week” is when we can expect to here more about a prospective fourth model.
That’s not much to go on, but paired with his acknowledgement that a “Y” is an inevitability, if only because of his commitment to the daddest joke of all time.
Musk also brought up the Model Y on an earnings call last year, noting that it would be the focus after the Model 3, specifically because it’s going to be the next strongest offering Tesla can put forward in terms of demand. That’s also when he laid out that it would take the shape of a compact SUV. It’s likely the Y will be built on the same basic platform as the Model 3, which is designed to support different chassis configurations for different purposes.
It’s not clear at all how this news will arrive, but keep your eyes on Musk’s Twitter – he tends to reveal a lot of salient details related to Tesla’s business in 140 character increments.

431,Shared EV access is expanding in Portland,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/28/shared-ev-access-is-expanding-in-portland/,2017/03/28,"
Portland, Oregon, has started a pilot program to bring car sharing and alternative fuels to low-income neighborhoods where residents might not consider either type of transportation accessible. A partnership between electric-vehicle advocates at Drive Oregon, local utility Pacific Power and the Hacienda Community Development Corporation formed to bring three used Honda Fit EVs and chargers to the Vista de Rosas affordable housing apartment complex.
In communities like Portland, where electric vehicles were adopted pretty quickly and the infrastructure to support them is growing rapidly, pre-owned EVs are not hard to find. They’re also far less expensive than new EVs, even when you figure in the federal tax credit. And they’re cheaper to operate than gasoline vehicles. According to Drive Oregon, fueling and maintaining an EV is about a quarter the cost of a gasoline vehicle.
It’s not unusual for lower-income communities to have higher rates of air pollution and the health impacts that come along with that. These communities are often close to highways and industrial areas; Vista de Rosas is near a busy arterial road and Portland International Airport. Adding shared EVs to the neighborhood reduces emissions for the neighborhood, at least a little. There’s certainly room to improve.
Charging stations were installed at the apartment complex by CarCharging Group to make recharging as convenient as possible and keep the cars in rotation. The cars can be rented by visiting the peer-to-peer site Turo.com.
Keeping shared EVs charged has been a challenge for other businesses. Part of the car2go fleet in Portland was electrified a few years ago, but the service had to abandon the EV idea when it became apparent that the cars were out of rotation for too long while they recharged.
The neighborhood where Vista de Rosas is located in Portland is served by car2go, though it sits in a far corner of the service area. There are fewer shared cars available at the edges; the bulk of the vehicles are in the downtown core of the city. Offering a small fleet of shared EVs in a neighborhood like this one brings the benefits of both car sharing and alternative fuels for errands, appointments and commutes where public transportation can be inconvenient and car ownership can strain a budget.

432,Judge criticizes Uber’s secrecy in lawsuit with Waymo,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/28/judge-criticizes-ubers-secrecy-in-lawsuit-with-waymo/,2017/03/28,"
Google’s side of the story in its patent and trade secret case against Uber is pretty damning — Google alleges that a former employee of its self-driving car unit, Anthony Levandowski, stole thousands of sensitive documents on his way out the door to lead Uber’s self-driving efforts. But, as an attorney for Uber told reporters last week, Uber would very much like all of this to be resolved in arbitration between Google’s Waymo and Levandowski rather than in open court.
That desire for secrecy is on full display in a new, heavily redacted motion Uber filed in the case today, asking for the dispute to be forced into arbitration based on the employment contract Levandowski signed with Google. Arbitration would have several benefits for Uber — it would distance the company from the allegations of theft leveraged against Levandowski, and it would keep the proceedings out of the public eye.
“Waymo especially should not be allowed to avoid arbitration where it has alleged pervasive collusion between Levandowski and Defendants, and where its claims are connected with, and founded on, Levandowski’s alleged misconduct while he was a Waymo employee — conduct that his employment contracts governed,” Uber argued. “Waymo’s purpose for proceeding in this curious manner seems clear: through artful pleading, it hopes to avoid arbitrating the misappropriation and UCL [unfair competition law] claims at all costs.”
Waymo claims that, regardless of Levandowski’s employment contract, Uber is still infringing on its patents and so the case needs to move forward.
Judge William Alsup, who is presiding over the case, slammed Uber’s heavy redactions and told both companies to sort out what actually needs to be kept secret from Levandowski’s employment contract.

“Our federal courts belong to the public, and the public and the press have a legitimate interest in looking over our shoulders to see the work in progress in our courts. The essence of our work concerns evaluating competing arguments. Parties should not hide those arguments under seal out of a desire to shroud business dealings in secrecy,” he wrote.
The two companies are due back in court on May 3 to debate a preliminary injunction that would prevent Uber from using Waymo technology while the lawsuit is underway. Judge Alsup has asked Uber and Waymo to come up with code names for Waymo’s trade secrets so that they can be referenced during the public hearing.
Update, 2 p.m. PT: Uber said in a new filing that the redactions are all Google’s fault and that it wanted to file an unredacted brief in the first place. “Uber applied the redactions based on Google’s insistence that the existence of an arbitration and every word in its employment agreements must be kept in strictest confidence – we are trying to confer with them further on that issue now,” an attorney for Uber wrote.

433,Wrench raises $4 million to bring auto repairs to your door,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/28/wrench-raises-4-million-to-bring-auto-repairs-to-your-door/,2017/03/28,"
A Seattle startup called Wrench has raised $4 million in Series A funding for an app that sends certified auto mechanics to the customer’s door. The round was led by Madrona Venture Group, according to Wrench CEO and co-founder Ed Petersen.
In general, people dread cars repairs. According to a AAA survey, 2 out of 3 people in the U.S. don’t trust auto repair shops and more than half have had negative past experiences. Two of the biggest concerns are that mechanics will recommend unnecessary services and overcharge for their work.
But repairs aren’t going away. Americans bought a record number of cars last year, 17.5 million to be precise. Petersen said, “We really want to remove the hassle of car ownership.”
Wrench gives users an option to book tuneups and a good range of repairs, a la carte. But it is also rolling out a subscription for regular upkeep. For certain jobs, like transmission work or rim repair, Wrench refers drivers to a network of partners, rather than attempt to do that heavier work “in your driveway.”
The deal marks the third automotive investment in Madrona’s portfolio. The firm has also backed Echodyne, a company making lightweight radar technology to enable self-driving vehicles, and Booster Fuels, an app that allows users to have their cars refueled in the lot while they are at work.
Madrona’s Managing Director Len Jordan said, “This is a big market that hasn’t changed much in probably 100 years. What we specifically like about Wrench is that they provide a managed service, owning the customer experience from the moment you ask to have your car repaired until you are happy with the service and pay your bill.”
Other startups have cropped up to offer auto repairs in your own driveway, including: YourMechanic and Fiix in the US. But in Petersen’s view, these are more like classic, peer-to-peer marketplaces that help qualified mechanics find flexible freelance work.
We asked Petersen if he’s worried about the fact that fewer people are getting their drivers’ licenses these days. “Somebody has to own all those ride-share and self-driving vehicles,” the CEO said. Wrench actually does a portion of its business with corporate clients. For example, it has a partnership with Lyft in Seattle, and provides inspections for new drivers before they are on-boarded in that market.
Given the new funding, Wrench will aim to further saturate the major markets where it has rolled out its service already: Seattle, San Diego, Portland and Phoenix. It also wants to expand into a few new markets in the West but isn’t making a “land grab.” Too many “on-demand” startups and marketplace have made the mistake of rapid, geographic expansion, Petersen said.

434,Didi Chuxing is reportedly considering a $6 billion investment backed by SoftBank Group,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/27/didi-softbank/,2017/03/27,"
Didi Chuxing, the largest ride sharing app in China, is deliberating a proposed $6 billion investment backed by SoftBank Group, according to a report in Bloomberg.
Bloomberg says that if completed, “the funding would be the single largest for a Chinese technology startup on record.” But the potential round’s massive size means it could dilute other existing shareholders. As a result, Didi Chuxing backers Apple and Tencent are thinking of joining the investment on a pro rata basis in order to avoid diluting their stakes.
SoftBank is already an investor in Didi Chuxing, one of an international roster of ride sharing companies, including Ola and Grab, it began backing in 2014.
It’s not clear if the $6 billion round would come from SoftBank Group or its $100 billion SoftBank Vision Fund, which is expected to close soon and also counts Apple among its investors.
Other big names among Didi Chuxing’s roster of more than 100 investors include Alibaba (the e-commerce company is itself another SoftBank investment) and Foxconn Technology Group. Didi Chuxing, which agreed to buy Uber China last summer, reportedly reached a $34 billion valuation after Foxconn’s $120 million investment last fall.
If Didi Chuxing does indeed accept the $6 billion in new funding from SoftBank, a good chunk of the capital would probably be poured into the development of self-driving vehicles. The company recently opened an artificial intelligence lab in Silicon Valley and has poached talent from Alphabet’s Waymo and Uber, two of its biggest rivals in autonomous driving tech.
While Didi Chuxing is the biggest company of its kind in China and no longer has to worry about competition from Uber China, it still has other rivals to fend off for market share. For example, UCAR, a competitor, recently raised a total of $1 billion. Other competitors include Yidao, backed by LeEco, and ride sharing services by e-commerce company Meituan and automaker Geely.
Didi Chuxing also has to cope with new regulations that limit its driver pool in Beijing, Shanghai and other cities.

435,Faraday Future cancels plans to build an assembly factory in California,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/27/faraday-future-cancels-plans-to-build-an-assembly-factory-in-california/,2017/03/27,"
Faraday Future, the would-be Tesla rival facing well-documented challenges in terms of capitalization and efforts to bring its first production vehicle to market, has scrapped plans to construct an assembly facility and “experience center” (read: showroom) in Vallejo, California on Mare Island. The car maker had already secured a negotiating agreement with the Vallejo city council regarding the site, but the company has been scaling back some of its ambitions in the interest of protecting its core interests.
Faraday’s planned North Bay site would’ve been its second assembly plant, intended to begin operation sometime after its Nevada factory maximized its own production capacity. The Nevada plant has faced its own challenges, after the 3 million-square-foot, $1 billion facility saw work stop on its construction late last year due to contractor non-payment. The Nevada facility plans have been reset, with a more modest 650,000- square-foot facility planned for completion sometime this fall. Faraday says it’ll resume work on this Vegas facility shortly.
The electric car company hasn’t closed the door entirely on future potential projects with Vallejo, noting in a statement to TechCrunch that it “would like to thank the City and its officials for their generosity and professionalism throughout this process, and looks forward to exploring future opportunities with the City.” But despite an optimistic launch of the FF 91 at CES earlier this year, its first production target vehicle, it’s unclear where the future will lead for Faraday.
A Faraday spokesperson noted that while it found through its initial study that the Mare Island site was appropriate for its needs, its focus is now on the North Las Vegas facility, for which construction efforts will resume “soon.” The full statement from Faraday is included below:

Faraday Future (FF) has an update on its planned manufacturing facility and user experience center on North Mare Island in Vallejo. Due to the new strategy to focus corporate efforts on development of its first production vehicle and plant in North Las Vegas, FF has decided to end its Exclusive Right to Negotiate (ERN) with the City of Vallejo. FF will stay in contact with the City, and remains interested in acquiring land on North Mare Island in the future. FF would like to thank the City and its officials for their generosity and professionalism throughout this process, and looks forward to exploring future opportunities with the City.
As part of its due diligence, FF conducted various technical studies to assess the Island for development feasibility. The 157-acre North Mare Island site was found adequate to support development of a manufacturing facility and user experience center, and the results of these studies will be shared with the City as part of the original agreement.
FF’s new multi-phased manufacturing strategy in Nevada is designed to bring FF 91, the company’s flagship vehicle, to production more quickly, allowing FF to fill vehicle reservations that were collected following the car’s launch at CES 2017.
FF plans to restart construction at the North Las Vegas site very soon.

Toyota and NTT, one of Japan’s largest carriers, are teaming up to work on connected vehicle technology, with an agreement to work together on research and development in this emerging area. The team-up makes a lot of sense, since both carriers and automakers are looking to maximize the amount of data they can get from their customers as vehicles become increasingly connected.
The partnership will include NTT and Toyota sharing tech and expertise, and creating big data research projects using vehicle info collected from across Toyota’s fleet of connected cars. The collaboration will also see both work together on studies regarding next-generation connectivity and computing technologies, including 5G mobile networks and edge computing, where work including artificial intelligence is done in a distributed fashion, using processors embedded in vehicles, rather than at a centralized server farm.
NTT and Toyota will also work on studying the best possible deployment of data centers and connectivity infrastructure for blanket coverage of vehicles in operation and transmitting data, and they’ll also work together on building artificial intelligence agents for interacting with and serving drivers.
Toyota showed off what this might eventually look like with its Concept-i vehicle at the Consumer Electronics Show in January, which included a virtual assistant called “Yui” which was billed as an AI companion that can help with vehicle autonomy, trip planning’s schedule management and more.
We’ll see the first results of this partnership put to work in a field trial designed to “assess the feasibility and usability of representative services” related to connected vehicle tech, NTT said in a press release.

Waymo is working on one of the key areas it still needs to tackle ahead of any general public launch of its self-driving technology: snow. The company’s vehicles still had a lot to learn in this specific realm as of late last year, and it’s one of the most challenging road conditions any autonomous vehicle can face, because of the effects of deep cold and blanketing snow not only on traction and vehicle handling, but also on sensors and optics.
Waymo CEO John Krafcik posted a tweet with an image of the Waymo Chrysler Pacifica minivan, kitted out with its in-house self-driving sensor technology, in a snowy setting at South Lake Tahoe in California. The Lake Tahoe location keeps Waymo within the domain of its license to test autonomous systems on state roads, but also provides snowy environs to test more extreme conditions and help it build out its flexibility in terms of weather conditions.

Waymo’s Pacifica vans began test drives on public roads in both California and Arizona in January. Other companies pursuing self-driving technology, including GM through its Cruise acquisition, have expressed their intent to also test in Michigan, where inclement weather conditions will help them focus in on that difficult area still in need of exploration and improvement.
Waymo has done testing in Tahoe previously, stretching back to 2012, using its earlier Lexus-based test vehicles. It’s aiming to test its tech in a wide range of environments, including in Kirkland, where it can see how it performs in rain and mist, and in Arizona, where arid, desert conditions and a surplus of dust are ready to hand.

The Tesla Model 3 will eventually get a more performance-oriented option, which Tesla CEO Elon Musk says we can probably expect in around a year or so. The Model 3 tuned for better performance might inherit more of the muscle of the Model S, in a smaller, lighter package, but Musk says not to expect it to ever top the Model S on acceleration, since the original Tesla electric luxury sedan will always be able to accommodate a larger battery.
A Performance 3 arriving after the more modest Model 3 might strike some early pre-order customers the wrong way, if they were hoping to max out the specs on their vehicles with available options. But we still don’t know much about what kind of offers those who reserved their place in line will be able to choose from when it comes time to finish out their purchase.


@dr_angus Yeah, probably a year from now. S will still win on acceleration though, due to having more space for a larger battery.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 24, 2017



What we do know about the Model 3 so far is that it will have a minimum range of somewhere around 215 miles per charge based on EPA ratings, and that it’ll cost $35,000 before tax rebates for the base model. It’ll also come with all the sensor and compute hardware needed to attain full self-driving, and it will have Autopilot on board, though Model 3 owners will have to pay extra to enable certain features.

Tesla’s hyping its Model 3 ahead of its launch later this year, when it’s set to start shipping to early pre-order customers. Company CEO Elon Musk posted the above to Twitter, showing the “release candidate” of the car taking its first drive. An RC candidate, in software terms, is the final version prior to public launch, which means that Tesla is probably very close to spinning up its production lines.
The clip above doesn’t show much, but it does show a car, with all car-like essentials apparently working, and what looks like poppy acceleration speed. The car is Tesla’s $35,000 electric vehicle with a minimum of 215 miles promised by the company; production is set to kick off in earnest in July.
Musk tweeted earlier on Friday that customers shouldn’t expect it to leapfrog the Model S in terms of tech — it’s cheaper for a reason. Still, there’s lots to get excited about given its promised specs.

The Tesla Model 3 is not a product iteration along the lines of successive iPhones, Elon Musk clarified on Twitter on Friday. Instead, it’s a “smaller model affordable version of Model S” with less range, less power and fewer features, according to the Tesla CEO. The Model S is still going to be the leader in terms of it technological capabilities — so think more iPhone SE than iPhone 7 versus iPhone 6s.
Musk’s tweets were sparked by observation that many watching for the release of the Model 3, which is set for later this year, would be a kind of next-generation Tesla vehicle. Per the CEO, it’s more like Tesla will be leveraging its existing and past technical achievements, adding in the benefits of having nailed down their production processes to build them affordably at scale.

This is where the frequent Tesla comparisons to Apple start to break down a bit, and we’re reminded that, at heart, it’s a car company. Automakers typically debut new tech in their high-end line, and then bring this to their more mass-market models over time — often spanning many years or even decades — as costs associated with manufacturing decline and make it possible to achieve decent margins with lower retail prices.
Musk also reiterated the reasoning behind the car’s name — the intent was to call it the Model E, but Ford blocked this because of its trademark on that name. The crude humor behind the idea was to have the names of Tesla’s first three models spell out “S–E-X.” Awkward dad joke CEO at the height of his craft.

441,Senators reintroduce a bill to improve cybersecurity in cars,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/23/senators-reintroduce-a-bill-to-improve-cybersecurity-in-cars/,2017/03/23,"
Senators Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut have reintroduced the Security and Privacy in Your Car (SPY Car) Act of 2017. They first introduced the bill, along with a similar bill for aircraft, during the last session.
The SPY Car Act places the onus for automotive cybersecurity and privacy standards on the shoulders of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The law would require critical software systems — those required for operation of the vehicle — to be isolated from noncritical systems. And then those isolated systems should be tested for security.
It also addresses securing personal information, including all data “collected by the electronic systems that are built into motor vehicles,” against unauthorized access. If there is a hacking attempt, the SPY Car Act calls for all cars to be equipped with the ability to detect the breach, report it and stop it from taking over the vehicle or collecting driving data. If a manufacturer doesn’t include this capability, under the law it would be fined $5,000 per car that didn’t have security technology built in.
So far, the SPY Car Act seems like something we’d expect to see. But then Sens. Markey and Blumenthal take another step in requiring a “cyber dashboard.” This would tell the driver how far above and beyond the basic requirements a car company has gone to secure the onboard electronic systems via an “easy-to-understand, standardized graphic.” So some kind of scorecard would be placed where anyone could see it.
But wait, there’s more! The SPY Car Act also requires that every vehicle give “clear and conspicuous notice” to the driver about what driving data is being collected, if it’s being transmitted or saved, and how it’s being used. Once you know this, the law would require that manufacturers give you the right to opt out of data collection without interfering with your ability to use navigation tools. And that data can only be used for marketing to you if you choose to opt in.
The SPY Car Act does exempt black-box-type data collection. That basic data is still useful in the event of a crash, or to check the emissions history of a vehicle.
Vehicle tracking specialists Satrak Plant Security polled 2,000 people in the U.K. recently and found that 40 percent of respondents said hacking was a “fairly serious” concern, which echoes other polls of consumers’ attitudes toward automotive cybersecurity. Now that NHTSA has created guidelines for autonomous vehicles, maybe it can build on its best practices guidelines if the SPY Car Act is passed.

Following Chevrolet’s lead, Jaguar Land Rover is the latest carmaker to offer an unlimited in-car data plan in the U.S. The AT&T prepaid data plan will coast $20 per month, and will be an option for any Jaguar and Land Rover cars with InControl Wi-Fi as an available feature. Up to eight devices can connect simultaneously to the in-car Wi-Fi network enabled by the cellular hotspot.
Cars equipped with InControl in the Jaguar and Land Rover lineup include the Jaguar XE, XF, XJ and F-Pace, as well as the Discovery, Discovery Sport, Range Rover, Range Rover Sport and Range Rover Evoque. These cars all feature a dedicated fixed antenna on the vehicle, which the company says is placed optimally in order to get the best possible cellular connection with AT&T’s network across the U.S.
Expect this to become more popular as an offering among major automakers, since connections in vehicles are a boon for them as well as for users, and if they can get more car owners to stump up for a subscription fee, they can offset the costs of building in the tech and connecting to the vehicle. Increasingly, the important market opportunity for carmakers is data, too, and offering an in-car connection is one way to help encourage the flow of said information.

443,Drivemode raises $6.5M from Panasonic and others for smartphone car tech,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/23/drivemode-raises-6-5m-from-panasonic-and-others-for-smartphone-car-tech/,2017/03/23,"
If you’re an Android device owner and also a driver, you may already be familiar with Drivemode: Available on Google Play, it’s one of the most popular apps for use in cars, with more than one million downloads and active users spread across 180 countries. The app is designed to reduce distractions for drivers via an eyes-free interface designed to access smartphone functions like navigation, messaging, calls and more, entirely via voice.
Drivemode just raised $6.5 million in a new Series A round, led by Panasonic, which, among its many talents, is also one of the largest automotive industry suppliers in the world. Panasonic is a strategic investor, and others included in the round include insurance provider Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance via its VC arm, as well as Innovative Venture Fund Investment and Miyako Capital. The nature and source of the funding suggests Drivemode has ambitions well beyond its existing consumer app. Founder and CEO Yo Koga confirms the company is focused on building out additional features for the app through its new partnership with Panasonic, but that it also has other ambitions in the works.
“Obviously, Panasonic wants to utilize our popularity as a driving app when working with automakers,” Koga explained. “So what we’re working on now is integrating their infotainment systems with our consumer app so that we can work with hardware products like display audio or basic audio, consumers have a lot more to users via the consumer app. At the same time, a lot of automakers are also interested in white label stuff as well, so that we’re working on separately, as well.”
Companies seem eager to partner with Drivemode; Koga says there’s a big backlog of deal pipeline it could pursue, but with a team of only eight people much of that has been on hold. What, then, is stopping other companies from stepping up and filling the demand either internally or via alternate partners? Google’s own Android Auto app on the Play Store enjoys worse reviews than Drivemode, for starters, which is a good indicator that Koga’s right when he points out how hard it is to make an app that does what Drivemode can do, and do it well.
“Drivemode is an extremely technical app,” he said. “A lot of automotive companies try to replicate what we’re doing, and a lot of hardware companies try to do this, too. Hardware companies, for example, can have fantastic hardware, but figuring out the hardware experience is the toughest part. Even simply answering incoming Facebook messages by voice is super technical, and not many can do it, at least with the right interface.”
Drivemode has been working on the problem with actual user feedback since the app first launched in beta in 2014, and continues to iterate on its voice-based interaction model. It’s also in regular contact with the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration (NHTSA), and Koga says they see eye-to-eye with the federal body on where in-car use of devices and services are headed in terms of maximizing safety.
Meanwhile, he argues their value to potential automaker and supply-side partners will only grow, given the direction in which the industry is headed.
“What’s going on in the automotive industry is that software will be key from now on,” Koga explained. “The problem with that is that automakers and suppliers don’t have direct access to the users, which is why they’re trying to come up with new standards like SDL [SmartDeviceLink] and others to figure out ways to connect with users. Getting data, and then liberating the data, in the automotive industry will be the key concern for [automakers].”
Drivemode’s free, in-app purchase supported model means it already has one of the largest install bases of any third-party software for use on smartphones in cars, which is bound to interest carmakers. Its range of features mean it can also reveal a lot about user habits, providing much more insight about customer behavior than carmakers, other than tech-centric players like Tesla, can generally expect to receive.

444,Nine manufacturers set for 2018 Formula E season,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/22/nine-manufacturers-set-for-2018-formula-e-season/,2017/03/22,"
Formula E announced the nine manufacturers that will race electric cars in seasons five, six, and seven. You may think this is no big whoop, but it is. Here’s why the whoop is big: beginning in season five, each team will race one car per driver for the entire race — like every other racing series on the planet — rather than two.
Because battery technology lagged behind series founder Alejandro Agag’s ambition for all-electric racing, Formula E teams have fielded two drivers with two cars per driver, so four cars in the garage. In the middle of the race, usually after about an hour on the track, the driver would pull onto pit row and climb out of the first car and into an identical second car with a fresh battery. It’s kind of the equivalent of refueling.
The new single-car standard will cover seasons five, six, and seven, which begin in fall 2018. The nine manufacturers who have met this standard are:

ABT Formel E
BMW AG
DS Automobiles
Jaguar Land Rover
Mahindra Racing
NextEV NIO
Penske Autosport
Renault
Venturi Automobiles

There are teams currently racing that are not represented on this list, including Faraday Future Dragon Racing and Techeetah. But other manufacturers are furthering their commitment to electric open-wheel racing, like Renault, Venturi, NextEV, and Mahindra. Jaguar jumped into the series for 2016-2017, while MS Amlin Andretti, which is also racing this season, seems to be dropping out before the new standards come into play. Mercedes-Benz had been planning to join the fray in season five, but its name is not on this list published by FIA, the series’ governing body.
Also in 2018, there will be a new Formula E car on the track; Spark Racing Technology will produce identical bodies for each team to cover in stickers and shiny paint as they see fit. The new battery that makes single-car racing possible will be supplied to the teams by McLaren Applied Technologies. And the Roborace series should be up and running by that time too. These elements added together could mean we’ll see a complete reboot of Formula E for season five.

445,Wanna hack your car? Macchina is a plug-and-vroom solution,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/21/when-this-baby-hits-88-mph/,2017/03/21,"
You can hack your IKEA furniture to be more awesome. You can hack video games to make your fellow gamers hate your guts. And with the help of Macchina — now on Kickstarter — you can teach your car a few new tricks, too. What could possibly go wrong?
Banana for scale
Macchina is a little device that plugs into your car. Nothing revolutionary so far; Automatic has been offering that for years. What is new, however, is that Macchina’s little wonderchild can read and write to your car’s ECU. Which means it can be used not just to figure out what is happening in the dark, mysterious crevasses of your car’s intestines… It also can be used to change things. Suffice to say; it’s probably a good idea to know what you’re doing before you start changing numbers.

Macchina is based on the Arduino Due platform, which means there are a ton of code examples there.

“This is a fantastic development platform built for newcomers and professionals alike,” the team says, although, as hinted at before, it would probably take a particularly steady fingered novice to want to take the risk of changing too much right off the bat. The team is also committed to making both hardware and software open source.
The device is designed to be a comprehensive platform, and can be connected to a number of peripherals, including Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Ethernet and cellular networks via break-out boards.
Overall, it’s one of those tremendously exciting projects that could completely turn the car peripherals world inside out, at a price-point that makes a lot of sense, too. The campaign has raised almost 5x its $25,000 goal, so it’s looking pretty good for now. Of course, it’s still a Kickstarter campaign, so caveat emptor, but damn if this isn’t a mighty tasty project…

446,DeepScale raises $3 million for perception AI to make self-driving cars safe,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/21/deepscale-raises-3-million-for-perception-ai-to-make-self-driving-cars-safe/,2017/03/21,"
According to the World Health Organization, human error causes more than 90 percent of traffic accidents across the globe. Some 1.25 million people die in crashes, and 20 to 50 million people are injured each year. Automakers are scrambling to develop cars with advanced driver-assistance systems that are so good they’re “crash-proof,” or fully autonomous vehicles, each safer than the next. But the automakers are somewhat limited by the computational resources onboard their vehicles.
Now, a startup out of Mountain View, Calif. called DeepScale has raised $3 million in seed funding to help automakers use industry-standard low-wattage processors to power more accurate perception. Alongside sensors, mapping, planning and control systems, perception, (sometimes referenced as “computer vision”) enables vehicles to make sense of what’s going on around them in real time.
DeepScale co-founder and CEO Forrest Iandola previously attained a doctorate at UC Berkeley working on deep neural nets and computer vision systems. His work there focused on, among other things, making AI systems learn to do something new in just a day instead of months of training. Iandola said, “Lots of deep neural network software out there is tied to processors like Nvidia’s. They make really good libraries for running neural net stuff quickly. We built our own libraries for fast, deep neural net computation on a variety of affordable processors, Qualcomm, Intel and the like. We’re using a lot of what we learned in academia on the commercial side now.”
While he did not have permission to name the companies, he said DeepScale is already working on pilot projects with some major original equipment manufacturers in automotive. With the market for automotive systems, data and services forecast to reach $70 billion in revenue annually by 2030, DeepScale is focused strictly on automotive for now. But, the CEO said, the technology could be adapted over the long term for use with unmanned drones or robotics, which also need to accurately understand and respond to changes in their environment.
DeepScale’s seed investors included: Bessemer Venture Partners, Greylock, Auto Tech Ventures, Andy Bechtolsheim (who was the first investor in Google) and Jerry Yang. A partner with BVP, Alex Ferrara, said, “Cars are moving from systems today where they have a large number of small computers, called ECUs, in them, to working with smaller more powerful computers for perception. But you have all these little sensors, lidar, radar, ultrasound, and each one brings its own view of the world. There’s a really interesting opportunity here for DeepScale to pull everything together and use info from all those sensors to make computer vision accurate and efficient.”
DeepScale is competing for a share of this burgeoning market versus some 800-lb. gorillas in automotive tech, like Mobileye, now owned by Intel, or Bosch, but also other funded startups like Comma.ai, Argo and Drive.ai, which are trying another approach of building their own, fully autonomous vehicles or retrofit systems.

447,Laying a trap for self-driving cars,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/17/laying-a-trap-for-self-driving-cars/,2017/03/17,"
We spend a lot of time and words on what autonomous cars can do, but sometimes it’s a more interesting question to ask what they can’t do. The limitations of a technology are at least as important as its capabilities. That’s what this little bit of performance art tells me, anyway.
You can see the nature of “Autonomous trap 001” right away. One of the first and most important things a self-driving system will learn or be taught is how to interpret the markings on the road. This is the edge of a lane, this means it’s for carpools only, and so on.
British (but Athens-living) artist James Bridle illustrates the limits of knowledge without context — an issue we’ll be coming back to a lot in this age of artificial “intelligence.”

A bargain-bin artificial mind would know that one of the most critical rules of the road is never to cross a solid line with a dashed one on the far side. But of course it’s just fine to cross one if the dashes are on the near side.
A circle like this with the line on the inside and dashes on the outside acts, absent any exculpatory logic, like a roach hotel for dumb smart cars. (Of course, it’s just a regular car he drives into it for demonstration purposes. It would take too long to catch a real one.)
It’s no coincidence that the trap is drawn with salt (the medium is listed as “salt ritual”); the idea of using salt or ash to create summoning or binding symbols for spirits and demons is an extremely old one. Knowing the words of command or secret workings of these mysterious beings allowed one power over them.
Here too a simple symbol “binds” the target entity in place, where ideally it would remain until its makers got there and… salvaged it? Or until someone broke the magic circle — or until whoever was in the driver’s seat took over control from the AI and hit the gas.
Imagine a distant future in which autonomous systems have taken over the world and knowledge of their creation and internal processes has been lost (or you could just play Horizon: Zero Dawn) — this simple trap might appear to our poor debased descendants to be magic.
What other tricks might we devise that cause inexorably a simple-minded AI to stop, pull over, or otherwise disable itself? How will we protect against them? What will the crime against mechanized AIs be — assault, or property damage? Strange days ahead.
Keep an eye on Bridle’s Vimeo or blog — the video above is a temporary one and the performance, like most things, is a “work in progress.”

Tesla has raised $1.2 billion in new cash from sale of common shares, and convertible notes that come due in 2022. The total amount includes $350 million in share sales, plus $850 million raised via the senior notes, which is a bit north of what it announced on Wednesday it was planning to raise.
The capital raise comes after Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on an earnings call that while it could’ve finished the process of ramping up for Model 3 production later this year with the funds it had on had, doing so would put it near “the edge” in terms of on-hand cash. The automaker has opted to seek more funding to help offset potential risks to shareholders associated with entering into production of the Model 3, which has already seen much stronger demand in pre-sales than the Model S or X thanks to its affordable sub-$35,000 (before federal tax credit) price point.
The raise also includes a personal purchase of $25 million in common shares by Elon Musk, who is already the top shareholder at Tesla with around 21 percent ownership in the company.

450,Leaked internal Uber documents show rocky self-driving car progress,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/16/uber-recode-leaked-autonomous-vehicle-data/,2017/03/16,"
New internal Uber documents leaked to Recode detail the company’s progress toward realizing its dream of a fleet of vehicles entirely devoid of pesky human drivers. As those files reveal, Uber’s month-over-month metrics aren’t exactly a steady line of progress, more a jerky sort of stumbling toward its goal of self-driving reliability. And as Uber’s court battle with Google over autonomous car tech begins, that visual is a particularly apt metaphor.
Uber’s self driving fleet, spread across Pennsylvania, California and Arizona, is driving more miles than ever, but its vehicles aren’t improving in a steady way on measurements of rider experience. Uber breaks this variable down into a few different data streams: how many miles a car makes it before a human takes over for any reason which it calls “miles per intervention,” how many miles a car goes before a “critical” driver takeover (to avoid harm or damage) and how many miles a car goes before a “bad experience,” a measure of overall ride smoothness that is less focused on safety.
By the miles per intervention measure, Uber’s fleet isn’t doing so hot. In January, an Uber autonomous vehicle could drive .9 miles before a driver takeover. By February, that number had inched up to one full mile before dropping down again to .71 miles. As of last week it was .8 miles.
When it comes to measures of critical interventions — the scary, accident-avoiding ones — Uber’s metrics are trending upward, albeit erratically. At the start of February, an autonomous vehicle could make it 125 miles without a critical intervention, but the following week that number dipped down to 50 miles. By the third week in February it shot back up to 160 miles before dipping to 115 again the following week. At the last measure, taken the week of March 8, it was up to 196 miles.
By measures of “bad experiences” like hard stops and jerky driving, the fleet is getting worse. In mid-January, Uber self-driving cars averaged 4.5 miles before a bad experience, but by the next month that had dropped down to 2 miles, where the number remained into the first week of March.
Recode’s numbers paint a rough outline of Uber’s autonomous vehicle performance, but it’s worth remembering that the cars are still figuring out routes and learning as they go. Still, as the numbers illustrate, Uber’s fleet is demonstrating some fairly wild swings on measures of safety and reliability. The numbers may be improving in aggregate, but their erratic movement doesn’t exactly inspire confidence when it comes to taking your hands off the wheel.

Google’s legal battle with Uber over the development of self-driving cars is already off to an ugly start. Lawyers for the two tech firms spent the last two days bickering over which attorneys should be allowed to view the trade secrets Google claims were stolen by their former employees who went to work at Uber, and a lawyer for Uber said today in court that the company has been unable to locate one of those engineers.
Google’s self-driving car unit is taking Uber to court over allegations that a star figure in the development of automated vehicles, Anthony Levandowski, stole trade secrets from Google before he abruptly quit his job. Soon thereafter, he founded his own self-driving truck company, Otto, which was acquired by Uber for $680 million.
Waymo, the self-driving wing of Google’s parent company Alphabet, claims that Levandowski downloaded 14,000 sensitive documents from a secure repository just before quitting without notice in January 2016. The company has also accused two other engineers, Radu Raduta and Sameer Kshirsagar, of swiping a handful of documents before they also accepted jobs at Uber.
Raduta doesn’t work for Uber anymore, Uber’s attorney Arturo Gonzalez told the court, and Uber hasn’t been able to locate him. Waymo claims that Raduta, who worked as a mechanical engineer for the company, downloaded several documents related to the self-driving car project last July, just before going to work at Uber.

 Gonzalez told reporters that Uber plans to argue in upcoming filings that the “whole matter” belongs in arbitration between Google and Levandowski, citing Levandowski’s contract with his former employer.
Uber also pushed back against Waymo’s claims that none of Uber’s in-house lawyers should be allowed to see unredacted versions of court filings that contain Google trade secrets. The two companies eventually settled on an agreement that just one of Uber’s in-house lawyers, Nicole Bartow, would be allowed to view the documents.

452,BMW’s self-driving car will aim for full Level 5 autonomy by 2021,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/16/bmws-self-driving-car-will-aim-for-full-level-5-autonomy-by-2021/,2017/03/16,"
BMW says that the car it intends to field with self-driving tech by 2021 will have Level 3, Level 4 and Level 5 capabilities, according to the automaker’s SVP of Autonomous Driving Elmar Frickenstein, who shared the info during a panel in Berlin on Thursday, Reuters reports. Level 5 autonomy would mean that the vehicle requires zero input from a driver to navigate city and highway roads, at least on par in terms of performance with a human driver.
Level 3 and 4 are considered much more achievable in the near-term: Level 3 cars still require drivers, but their intervention is only required in certain situations and they aren’t obliged to be watching things constantly and ready to take control immediately as with lower levels. Level 4 is the first level of “full autonomy,” which means it can handle a whole trip – just not in all possible conditions and environments.
Most automakers talking about autonomous vehicle deployment plans in the next few years are discussing Level 3 and 4 vehicles – Ford’s goal of putting a fleet of self-driving cars into service in 2021 specifically involves Level 4 autonomy, for instance. BMW’s decision to leapfrog to the most advanced level is ambitious, but it’s working with Intel and that chipmaker’s newly acquired self-driving hardware and systems subsidiary Mobileye on its autonomous tech, so it’s definitely not starting from a dead stop.

Nvidia’s already going deeper down the self-driving vehicle rabbit hole in partnership with Bosch, but it’s also moving further into autonomous trucking with a new partnership with PACCAR, one of the world’s largest makers of transport trucks.
The PACCAR arrangement has already resulted in the production of one proof-of-concept vehicle, a Level 4 autonomous truck that uses Nvidia’s Drive PX 2 platform with neural network training fed by data of humans driving semis-tractors. The partnership’s announcement included a showcase of this initial vehicle managing a closed road course, with no one behind the wheel.

PACCAR is an industry leader that already produces many of the trucks that make up global logistics fleets, but other startups including Uber-owned Otto and Embark are also racing to address this market. There’s a lot of interest in pushing autonomous driving tech forward in this industry because it has tremendous cost-saving potential in terms of increasing the amount of time trucks can spend on the road, and reducing fatalities related to human-caused accidents.
In aggregate, all of the deals Nvidia is securing to provide the computing horsepower needed to make autonomous vehicles a reality represent a significant strengthening of its long-term position, as demand for self-driving is likely to only grow over the next couple of decades at least.

Lucid’s first electric vehicle doesn’t cost what you think it does – the company revealed basic pricing information for the Air on its blog, basically just to mute speculation that its price tag would begin north of $100,000. The Lucid Air’s actual price will start at $60,000, hitting $52,500 once you apply the federal tax credit for EV buyers.
That’s for the base model, of course, but the base model sounds relatively well-equipped, with a 240-mile range on a single charge, 400 horsepower from its rear-wheel drive motor and all the sensor and computer hardware on board for a future update to provide autonomous driving.
Lucid’s other base model features include trunks at both front and rear, power front seats, four displays (three of which are touch-sensitive) and a 10 speaker audio system. The upgrades available on higher trim models include 315 and 400 mile batteries, a boost in horsepower up to a max of 1,000 HP, a glass canopy roof and more. Top line models will run north of $100,000, Lucid says, but it’s not revealing exactly how much more.
The first 255 Lucid Air vehicles off the line will be special Launch Edition cars with unique trim, including 315 miles of range, 1,000 horsepower and better in-car audio – these will also be priced above $100,000, but it sounds like they may differ from the general production top trim vehicles in at least a few regards.
Lucid’s already seeking reservations for the Air, with a $2,500 deposit required for the standard production models, and a $25,500 commitment required for those first 255 special edition vehicles.

Nvidia’s new partner in bringing AI-powered self-driving tech to the masses definitely has the experience needed to go truly mass-market – it’s Bosch, leading tier one auto industry supplier. Bosch will build an AI supercomputer designed for use in vehicles using Nvidia tech, which means Nvidia now has a partner that works as a tier one supplier to all major car makers in the world.
It’s only the latest partner for Nvidia’s AI-powered self-driving car tech, joining automakers like Audi and Mercedes-Benz, but it’s the one that could potentially have the most impact in giving Nvidia reach and influence across the industry. The German company’s product portfolio ranges from home appliances, to infotainment solutions, to virtually everything in between.
This is the kind of strategic tie-up that lets both partners do what they do best – Nvidia can focus on developing the core AI supercomputing tech, and Bosch can provide relationships and sales operations that offer true scale and reach.
Nvidia’s deep learning model does not depend on specific rules being coded for each individual situation; instead, it provides the systems with a number of examples from human behavior, and then the AI can determine on its own what to do in specific scenarios. The mid-step implementation of this tech is Nvidia’s AI co-pilot, which will allow the vehicle to work with a human driver to understand where their attention is directed and provide warnings about undetected hazards, as well as read a driver’s lips and use audio cues to understand commands regardless of the in-vehicle noise environment.
Bosch’s super computer will use Nvidia’s Drive PX line with Xavier architecture, which is the world’s first single-chip processor that can manage Level 4 autonomous driving capabilities.

Tesla is looking to raise a total of around $1.15 billion from stock and convertible senior notes as a way to help “further reduce any risks” that it’ll incur as it scales its business to handle its aggressive Model 3 production schedule, the company said on Wednesday. Tesla’s decision to pad out its balance sheet with more capital was anticipated by many analysts, and a fair number of Wall Street watchers actually thought Tesla would seek more to help it grow based on recent comments made by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.
The Model 3 is set to begin full production this year, with pre-production begun in February with a temporary production line pause to help get processes at its Fremont factory ready for the new vehicle. The split of the new funding efforts will see Tesla pursue $250 million in common stock offering, with $750 million raised via convertible notes due in 2022. Elon Musk himself will personally contribute by buying $25 million in Tesla stock, Reuters reports.
Tesla last raised cash via stock offering in May 2016, selling $1.4 billion worth of shares to help it expand its production capacity.
Musk said on the company’s earnings results conference call in February that while Tesla could finish its production preparations for Model 3 without bringing in new funds, that would put the company “close to the edge” in terms of its overall cash position, and said it was then sensible for the electric carmaker to bring in new funds to help offset the risk that cutting it that close would entail for shareholders.

457,"Alibaba invests in WayRay, a maker of augmented-reality dashboards for smart cars",https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/15/alibaba-wayray/,2017/03/15,"
After launching its first car last year, Alibaba is digging deeper into the automobile industry. The Chinese Internet and e-commerce behemoth is the lead investor in smart car tech developer WayRay’s $18 million Series B round, the startup announced.
Founded in 2012, WayRay makes holographic navigation systems. According to its funding announcement, WayRay has already spent $10 million of its own capital, as well as previous venture funding, on the technology that underpins Navion, an augmented-reality dashboard that overlays directions and other information onto a driver’s view of the road. The company plans to launch a consumer version of Navion in 2017.
In a prepared statement, Alibaba Group’s senior investment director, Ethan Xie, said, “We believe there is huge potential in the development of leading-edge technology like augmented reality and its application to various industries, like WayRay’s AR navigation system in the auto sector. The potential of augmented reality makes it an exciting and promising area.”
Alibaba made its debut in the car industry last summer, when the RX5, a smart car it developed with SAIC (one of China’s “big four” state-owned auto manufacturers—opened for pre-orders. The RX5 uses Alibaba’s Yun operating system and the company hopes to make the vehicle part of an Internet-of-Things ecosystem that will include its other smart hardware and Internet services like Alipay.
But Alibaba’s smart cars are already up against rivals from other big Chinese tech companies like LeEco, which bills its electric car LeSee as “the first mobility ecosystem on wheels,” and Baidu, which is developing smart car technology and autonomous vehicles with BAIC, another of China’s big four state-owned automakers.
WayRay also said that it will partner with Banma Technologies—a joint venture between Alibaba Group and SAIC—to create an augmented-reality navigation and entertainment system for a car that will be launched by Banma in 2018. WayRay claims that this is “the world’s first vehicle in-production with a holographic AR head-up display.”

458,From your dorm room to your car: ethernet is back,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/15/from-your-dorm-room-to-your-car-ethernet-is-back/,2017/03/15,"
Wi-Fi, DSRC, Bluetooth, NFC — there are so many ways to connect without cables that ethernet seems retro, like a flip phone. But ethernet is staging a comeback in our cars. Manufacturers like Hyundai and Land Rover are using this old-school technology to connect the sensors that allow for advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS) and baby steps toward self-driving cars.
“As autonomous driving and safety features have come about, there is a need for higher capacity networking within the car,” said Ali Angha of Spirent in a phone interview. “It’s a proven technology that’s been around for a long time.”
For years, sensors have communicated with the car’s main computer using point-to-point connections. “At one end is a device, and there’s another device on the other end, and they’re directly communicating,” Angha said. But when there are so many sensors, including cameras, radar and LIDAR, that is a lot of point-to-point cabling. Angha said that the cabling in a modern vehicle is the third-heaviest component of a car, after the engine and transmission. “It’s a lot of copper,” he said.
Enter the ethernet! It uses switches that allow connections to any number of devices, reducing the amount of cabling required and thus the overall weight of the car. It’s also more scalable, allowing devices and sensors to connect at different speeds. Ethernet also has the benefit of components being available off the shelf, so automakers don’t have to design everything from scratch.
Moving away from point-to-point communications within a vehicle does create security vulnerabilities, Angha admitted: “You have a lot of points of connection into the system,” including over-the-air updates and Wi-Fi hotspots. But that’s where segmenting comes in. Groups can be created within an ethernet system that communicate with each other but are isolated from other groups. The idea is to reduce the likelihood that outside connections will create vulnerabilities for mission-critical systems.
“Within the car, in the very long term, everything is going to be ethernet,” Angha predicted. It will be able to handle uncompressed video, which becomes important in autonomous driving, where computations are based on image recognition. “If someone runs into the road, you cannot afford the time to compress and uncompress a video” in order to avoid hitting them, Angha said.
But it’ll be a while before ethernet systems are used throughout cars. There are plenty of sensors that don’t require a lot of bandwidth, like the one that knows if your window is up or down. Angha noted that it’s more cost-effective for OEMs to not change those kinds of connections. But over time, ethernet could end up being cheaper in terms of both manufacturing and maintenance, he believes. “The security of connectivity will become a major concern, and ethernet solves that problem.”

459,Uber’s new in-app navigation is designed specifically for Uber drivers,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/15/ubers-new-in-app-navigation-is-designed-specifically-for-uber-drivers/,2017/03/15,"
Uber’s driver-facing app is getting big changes to its navigation experience, something Uber is doing to try to help make it easier for drivers to do their job without having to worry too much about switching apps or trusting navigation software designed primarily for consumer use.
The new Uber navigation experience is an upgrade from what was available in the iOS driver app, and a completely new addition to the Android version of their mobile software. Uber previously relied exclusively on external routing apps, including Google Maps and Waze on Android, offering a “Navigate” button that would pop drivers out directly into their third-party app of choice.
Uber’s Maps product team lead Manik Gupta and driver app senior product manager Maya Choksi told me in an interview that the whole project is designed to help improve service in general, offering better routing from point A to point B during a trip, but also improved pick-ups, drop-offs and, perhaps most importantly, improved driver experience.
“The goal for the new navigation experience is to provide drivers with the optimal driving experience for Uber specifically,” Choksi explained. “Previously we had a hacked together experience, using a combination of APIs to provide in-app navigation.”
That meant no control over crucial elements of the in-app navigation experience; Uber didn’t have control over the size of labels on display for things like street names and places, nor which to show and which to hide. These labels have varying degrees of importance depending on your purpose with driving, but Uber drivers generally want things that are different from ordinary drivers just getting from place to place.
Other factors that Uber’s team considered when developing the app include the average viewing distance — drivers tend overwhelmingly to have their phones mounted around three feet from their face, so the UI is designed to be easily viewed from that distance. Other Uber-specific considerations include routing to places like designed Uber pick-up points at airports that have them, and also identifying places like specific UberEATS parking spots at restaurants for delivery drivers as destinations.
“You want to make sure you have all the information, when you need it, in context,” explained Gupta. Uber’s goal overall was not to fully replace navigation apps if drivers prefer to still use other providers’ software, but to ensure that if they do remain within the app, they’re well-served with what’s on offer, thanks to features including different interface options designed to be extra easy on the eyes over many hours of nighttime driving.
That’s not to say what Uber is launching is perfect; far from it, says Gupta. They’re very aware that this is a first release for a product that will require a lot more development, he says, and they’ll be gathering feedback from drivers to iterate. Drivers, incidentally, were involved in the product’s initial creation — Uber says that five were brought in for early product design meetings with engineers, and Uber later beta tested with drivers first for very early development, with engineers riding shotgun and making changes on the fly, then in larger geographic tests to make sure that the app met the needs of Uber’s global driver customer base.

On Android, it’s a different story altogether, because Uber said it found that drivers tend to make more mistakes when they’re worried about switching apps from managing their trip start and navigation. The goal, again, is to increase efficiency and quality of service, and even little things count when you view Uber’s business as a whole.
Uber’s new navigation experience still relies on data from multiple providers — this isn’t Uber kicking Google or others to the curb altogether and going it alone. Gupta says that the intent is, and has always been, to create the best app for drivers in terms of convenience and efficiency, regardless of where the data comes from.
Uber obviously has a lot to worry about beyond just routing, but it continues work on product despite executive drama, harassment and culture issues and a lawsuit from autonomous driving competitor Waymo. The question will be how long it can continue to press the pedal on product while other distractions pile up.

460,Lucid Motors and Local Motors will tell us how to make modern cars at Disrupt NY 2017,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/14/lucid-motors-and-local-motors-will-tell-us-how-to-make-modern-cars-at-disrupt-ny-2017/,2017/03/14,"
The auto industry is one of the hardest to break into as a vehicle maker, so it’s great that we have onstage at Disrupt NY 2017 in May two young companies working in that space to talk us through the process of being new in a field where the dominant players haven’t changed much in almost a century.
Lucid Motors, makers of the forthcoming Lucid Air luxury electric sedan, and Local Motors, the collaborative vehicle concept creator working on everything from autonomous electric shuttles to cargo drones, will join us for a discussion of what it takes to be a new kind of vehicle company — and to show the world that there’s even room for that kind of venture to exist.

Lucid’s Peter Rawlinson, the car maker’s chief technical officer, has a lot of experience with being an upstart in cars — his previous job was as a vice president and engineering lead at Tesla Motors, where he led development of the Model S and ushered the company from boutique luxury oddity to the first truly viable U.S. electric-specific automaker. Rawlinson leads Lucid’s vehicle development team, and is a truly hands-on engineering executive who knows the hardware and business challenges involved in bringing a brand new EV to market.

Local Motors CEO Jay Rogers is equally eager to build the next-generation U.S. automotive brand, but he’s taking a very different approach. The former Marine and Harvard MBA built his company around the idea of vehicle concept “co-creation,” in which a community of more than 30,000 individuals, including designers, engineers, fabricators and fans, collaborate on crowdsourced car designs. Local Motors wants to build vehicles tailor-made for micro-markets, eschewing the one-size fits most approach of many car makers for something that offers specific answers to specific problems.
Both Lucid and Local offer a unique perspective on what it means to be the next great American car company, and we’re looking forward to hearing more about what they believe that entails.
Disrupt NY runs May 15-17 at Pier 36, and you can purchase tickets to the event here.

462,"New study notes that it’s a driverless future, not a people-less future",https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/13/new-study-notes-that-its-a-driverless-future-not-a-people-less-future/,2017/03/13,"
A new study from Arcadis, HR&A Advisors and Sam Schwartz Consulting offers advice for city planners who are contemplating a future that includes autonomous vehicles, or AVs, as the nerds call them. McKinsey (who was not part of this particular study) says that by 2030, autonomous vehicles will account for 15 percent of auto sales worldwide. The study released today, “Driverless Future: A Policy Roadmap for City Leaders,” estimates that nearly 8 million people in its three sample cities will choose an AV over a traditional vehicle in the next 15-20 years.
Those three sample cities were New York, Los Angeles and Dallas. They were chosen for their range of density, walkability and pubic transport usage. The study compared the cost of car ownership to hypothetical AV ridesharing (Chariot, UberPOOL) and AV ridesourcing (Uber, Lyft), and determined when people in those cities were likely to make the jump from commuting in their own car to calling a self-driving car.
But the study’s authors also point out that in order for AV to work, it has to work for everyone. They recommend things like using open data and universal apps so riders can compare prices, travel times and environmental impact across modes of transportation (buses, trains, AV ridesharing, bikes, etc.) and pay using one app.
To that end, the authors also remind cities to remember that not everyone has equal access to (or interest in) technology. People who don’t have cell phones or bank accounts need to be able to access the transportation network, including autonomous rideshare or ridesource vehicles, through Dial-a-Ride and smartcard payment options.
It’s also worth considering now, as these technologies and services are expanding globally, how to fund accessible services. For example, the study notes that in New York City, there is a 30-cent fee per taxi ride that supports the city’s expansion of wheelchair-accessible transportation options. Ridesourcing services like Lyft and Uber do not pay that fee.
There are, of course, potential drawbacks to having fleets of AVs wandering city streets, and the study is aware of these problems. Mass adoption of AVs could encourage sprawl and increase the number of miles cars travel, and the system could develop in a way that leaves behind anyone without a cell phone and a checking account. AVs also could decrease public transit revenues, which would make public transportation an even less attractive option than it is now in most cities.
The study basically lays out two futures: the bad one where nobody plans and traffic congestion becomes unbearable and social inequalities get worse through lack of mobility, or the good one where cities plan for more than the immediate future to encourage mixed-use neighborhoods and towns with better transit options for everyone and fewer parking lots. Let’s stay optimistic out there.

463,"Intel buys Mobileye in $15.3B deal, moves its automotive unit to Israel",https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/13/reports-intel-buying-mobileye-for-up-to-16b-to-expand-in-self-driving-tech/,2017/03/13,"
First they partnered, and now comes the acquisition: The computing giant Intel has confirmed that it is acquiring Mobileye, a leader in computer vision for autonomous driving technology, for $15.3 billion — the biggest-ever acquisition of an Israeli tech company.
Specifically, “Under the terms of the agreement, a subsidiary of Intel will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Mobileye for $63.54 per share in cash, representing a fully-diluted equity value of approximately $15.3 billion and an enterprise value of $14.7 billion,” the company noted in a statement. The deal is expected to close in about nine months, Intel said.
Mobileye today covers a range of technology and services, including sensor fusion, mapping, front- and rear-facing camera tech and, beginning in 2018, crowdsourcing data for high-definition maps, as well as driving policy intelligence underlying driving decisions. This deal will bring under Intel’s umbrella not only a much bigger range of the different pieces that go into autonomous driving systems, but also a number of relationships with automakers. In the call today, Mobileye’s CTO and co-founder Amnon Shashua said the company is working with 27 car manufacturers, including 10 production programs with Audi, BMW and others going into 2017.
“This acquisition is a great step forward for our shareholders, the automotive industry and consumers,” said Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO, in a statement. “Intel provides critical foundational technologies for autonomous driving including plotting the car’s path and making real-time driving decisions. Mobileye brings the industry’s best automotive-grade computer vision and strong momentum with automakers and suppliers. Together, we can accelerate the future of autonomous driving with improved performance in a cloud-to-car solution at a lower cost for automakers.”
“We expect the growth towards autonomous driving to be transformative. It will provide consumers with safer, more flexible, and less costly transportation options, and provide incremental business model opportunities for our automaker customers,” Ziv Aviram, Mobileye co-founder, president and CEO, added. “By pooling together our infrastructure and resources, we can enhance and accelerate our combined know-how in the areas of mapping, virtual driving, simulators, development tool chains, hardware, data centers and high-performance computing platforms. Together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry.”
Confirming our earlier report, Intel said that Mobileye’s CTO and co-founder, Prof. Amnon Shashua, will lead Intel’s autonomous driving division, which will be based in Israel. Doug Davis, Intel’s SVP, will oversee how Mobileye and Intel work together across the whole company and will report to Shashua.
Other notable exits that have tapped into Israel’s expertise in computer vision and machine learning have included Google buying mapping startup Waze for $1.1 billion and Apple buying 3D sensor specialist PrimeSense for reportedly around $300 million.
The negotiations about what stays where for Mobileye and Intel are reminiscent of one of the other big M&A deals in Israel’s tech history, concerning Waze. Originally, Waze was being courted by Facebook, although there were disagreements over where Waze’s staff would be centered: engineering wanted to stay in Israel while Facebook was keen to get them to Facebook’s HQ in Menlo Park. Ultimately, that delay led to Google swooping in, agreeing to Waze’s terms and closing the deal.
Intel has been working officially with Mobileye since last year. Earlier this year, with BMW, the two started to test 40 self-driving cars equipped with the two companies’ technology. Mobileye was also an early partner of Tesla’s for its autonomous technology, although that relationship is ending amid some controversial undertones about safety measures at the carmaker. Other investments that Intel has made in the space of cars include taking a stake in Here (which will feed into the mapping initiatives at Mobileye); acquiring Itseez and Yogitech for safety and navigation functionalities in autonomous cars; making a commitment of at least $250 million to the space (which sounds so tiny considering today’s price tag); keeping a strong presence at auto shows; and, in November, launching a dedicated autonomous driving group, which is headed up by Doug Davis, who will now report to Mobileye’s CTO.
Mobileye went public on the Nasdaq in 2014 and currently has a market cap of about $10.5 billion. It’s trading up now more than 33 percent ahead of the market opening on the news. As a point of context, the company had moved only 0.83 percent on Friday’s trades.
Intel had been a leader in processors at the peak of the PC era, although it has competed hard (and often lost) as smartphones overtook the larger devices as consumers’ computers of choice.
Moving deeper into self-driving technology is part of Intel’s bigger strategy to build up its position in emerging areas of computing. Other verticals that Intel has focused on include connected “objects” (IoT) and virtual and augmented reality. It has been following through on this strategy with acquisitions as well as organic growth.
“The combination is expected to accelerate innovation for the automotive industry and position Intel as a leading technology provider in the fast-growing market for highly and fully autonomous vehicles,” the company continued. “Intel estimates the vehicle systems, data and services market opportunity to be up to $70 billion by 2030. The transaction extends Intel’s strategy to invest in data-intensive market opportunities that build on the company’s strengths in computing and connectivity from the cloud, through the network, to the device.”
Intel has disclosed several other acquisitions in Israel to fill out that strategy, including buying a personal assistant platform from Ginger Software; Omek Interactive for gesture-based technologies; and Replay Technologies for 3D video.
Intel is not the only company that is investing in and acquiring startups in the area of computer vision to raise its game in the area of autonomous cars.
Just earlier today, Valeo, the automotive parts giant, announced that it had acquired gestigon, a start‑up out of Germany that develops in-car 3D image processing software — used both to communicate to the driver as well as pick up signals from within the car and from the driver to communicate to a self-driving (or partially self-driving) car what to do next.
Terms of the deal, which includes staff as well as IP, were not disclosed. Valeo has been a regular investor in autonomous driving tech, taking a stake, for example, in French autonomous shuttle company Navya and getting a license in California to test self-driving cars. This latest acquisition shows that it remains serious about doing more in this area.
We’ll be dialing into the companies’ call with investors in about 30 minutes and will update this story with more then.
Story has been updated with official confirmation and more details.

464,"Engie, the car diagnostics app and mechanic marketplace, launches in UK",https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/13/engie/,2017/03/13,"
Engie, the Israeli startup that offers a car diagnostics device and app to enable you to better understand the health of your car, and is tied to a marketplace for local mechanics, sees its full U.K. launch today.
Priced at £14.99 for Android users or £19.99 for iOS, Engie’s Bluetooth device plugs into you car’s on-board computer and via the accompanying Engie app tells you what might be wrong with your vehicle, or what repairs might be required in the near future.
I’m told this includes anything from engine malfunctions, emission and fuel consumption, to battery condition and maintenance information.
It then takes that information — thus making sense of the various data points that a car’s diagnostic “black box” already monitors — and connects you to the Engie after-market mechanic marketplace, which includes TripAdvisor-styled reviews and price comparisons for any work and parts required.
One caveat: The device claims to work with any car manufactured from 2002 except diesel cars, which are supported from 2005. The latter means that I’ve been unable to test Engie (yes, my car is old).
Once a specific malfunction is detected, the Engie app will alert local repair shops in its marketplace, who will assess the problem and send back a quote for required work. This also forms the basis for the startup’s business model: it takes a 6 percent commission on each job booked via the app.
Last June, Yarden Gross, co-founder and CEO of Engie, told me the inspiration for the startup came from his own feeling of being at the mercy of mechanics and the auto industry anytime something went wrong with his car.
He had no idea if he was being taken for a ride (pun intended) in terms of what he was being told needed repair or the cost of parts. Better technology and a more transparent marketplace — or, more specifically, Engie — was the answer.
Gross also said that, because each manufacturer or car model has different diagnostics interfaces and data points, producing a universal diagnostics card and app is non-trivial, involving a certain amount of reverse-engineering and gleaning of auto industry data.
Since launching in 2015, the company claims 100,000 registered users and works with 200 mechanics in Israel.

465,"At the Geneva Motor Show, the beautiful… and the damned?",https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/11/at-the-geneva-motor-show-the-beautiful-and-the-damned/,2017/03/11,"
Passing by the glittering luxury cars, with models draped elegantly over the hoods, you might get the impression that you were witnessing the height of power for the automotive industry. Not only has the internal combustion engine reached dizzying heights of refinement, but the plethora of electric, hybrid and fuel cell engines could leave you wondering if anything more need ever be invented.
Just take a look at Sedric, the transporter prototype from Volkswagen, the internals of which look more like an airport lounge than an SUV.
Designed from the ground up to be fully self-driving, it showed where VW thinks the future might head. You can summon your car via an app and tell it where you want to go. The car is supposed to be able to recognize its user and open the doors. You then chat nonchalantly to your passengers while the car whisks you to your location.
Volkswagen must — if you’ll forgive the pun — really motor. It has to spend billions on electric vehicles, self-driving and new mobility services, as it tries to accelerate away from the costly emissions test cheating scandal that hit demand for its diesel vehicles, and its overall brand position.
Meanwhile, over on the Porsche stand (also owned by VW), they plan to spend about $1.1 billion to create an all-electric Mission E, the brand’s first battery-only model that is expected to launch by 2020. Porsche also wants to make an all-electric version of its compact SUV Macan. And there will even be a hybrid version of the iconic 911 model.
Herbert Diess, the head of Volkswagen’s main passenger car division, told reporters: “We are really in a transitional phase for the industry. There are new competitors on the horizon like Tesla or Chinese ventures.”
Over at Volvo, they are adding new technology to their XC60 crossover, designed to help the car avoid or minimize damage in crashes. Its new ”Steer Assist” feature helps the SUV avoid hazards like other vehicles, pedestrians or large animals while also hitting the brakes at the same time.
Of course, the cost of this investment will change the structure of the car industry. BMW boss Harald Krueger said the cost of investments in new technologies could spur consolidation among smaller car makers. For example, some analysts say Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, which has less than 7 percent of the European market, could be a target for acquisition, given its high debts and expensive plants in Italy.
Car makers are scrambling to ape Tesla by introducing a range of new electric cars. Japanese brands like Toyota and Nissan have been the leaders in this field. Nissan launched its electric hatchback Leaf in 2010 and sold more than 250,000 units worldwide through December 2016, the largest number for a highway electric car in history.
Toyota’s hybrid vehicles sales in Europe were up 40 percent in 2016, and 32 percent of all sales in the region. So, today, one in every three cars Toyota sold in Europe is a hybrid.
Even Brexit is going to impact auto-maker strategy. British luxury brand Mini, which is owned by BMW, makes around 70 percent of its 360,000 cars at its Oxford plant in southern England, but now it looks like it will start making electric Minis outside of the U.K., probably in Germany or the Netherlands, or a new location altogether.
And Tata Motors-owned Jaguar is engineering its first electric performance SUV Concept — the I-Pace, with a view to giving it longer range, with fast charging times and better performance, aiming to beat out Tesla’s X model.
But while car markers scramble to add driverless functionality and electric versions, they are entirely missing three crucial strategic pressures.
The first is that just being electric and having driverless features is not going to be enough to save the car industry as it exists today. When every car is electric, no-one cares about the power train any more. When every car has driverless functions, you would not even think to buy a new car without those.
Secondly, a brand like Tesla’s most powerful weapon is, arguably, not the cars themselves but their customers. Tesla’s customers are literally willing the brand toward the future. That’s what they are buying when they buy a Tesla. In this respect Tesla is far closer to the brand of, say, Apple’s, than the brand of, say, BMW’s, which screams tradition, not innovation. Car makers don’t have an easy answer for that.
Lastly, it’s cities that are pivotal to the future of the car industry. This is where Europe could potentially punch above its weight. Regulation of transport infrastructure is going to be crucial for this new world, and the test of driverless technology in cities like Swindon in the U.K. will create a framework on which car markers can genuinely innovate. Until that happens, their plans for cars with different engines will come to nought. And let’s not even get into autonomous drone-like passenger vehicles flying above busy urban environments.
Beautiful cars at the Geneva Motor Show may be wonderful to look at. But 2017 just may go down in history as the last horse-drawn buggy “expo” did: a golden age that was soon overtaken by the future.

466,Self-driving coalition gains safety and mobility members,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/10/self-driving-coalition-gains-members/,2017/03/10,"
The Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets — founded in April 2016 by Ford, Lyft, Uber, Volvo and Waymo — doubled its membership this week. But rather than adding more car manufacturers and tech stars, the coalition has added several organizations that have a real stake in the implementation of self-driving cars: Mothers Against Drunk Driving, National Federation of the Blind, United Spinal Association, the R Street Institute and Mobility 4 All.
While many people still dream of taking a nap in a fully autonomous car as it drives them home from work or wish they could summon a self-driving car after one too many at the bar, there are whole segments of the population that see autonomous vehicles as a way to remove yet another barrier to mobility. (Of course, MADD would be very happy if you did summon an autonomous Uber from the bar.)
The new members of the coalition will bring their legislative expertise to the group, which will work on regulatory issues as well as technical challenges. The National Federation of the Blind in particular noted that it’s been working on accessible user interfaces in research and experimental situations for more than a decade. Mobility 4 All works to gain access for anyone who can’t drive for any reason, especially people with disabilities and seniors. Its focus here will be ensuring that autonomous cars of the future fit with the coalition’s goal of safely and rapidly deploying fully self-driving vehicles.
So far, one man is living the self-driving-vehicle dream. Last September, Sam Schmidt, a quadriplegic and former professional race car driver, was the first person to receive an autonomous vehicle driver’s license. The state of Nevada granted the license to Schmidt, who drives a purpose-built Corvette Z06 using his voice, head movement and breath. It allows him to drive the short distance to and from the track where he tests the car with Arrow Electronics, which modified the car.

467,Waymo files for an injunction against Uber’s use of its self-driving tech,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/10/waymo-files-for-an-injunction-against-ubers-use-of-its-self-driving-tech/,2017/03/10,"
Waymo has taken the next step in its suit against Uber, which it says took confidential proprietary information regarding how to make its custom-built LiDAR components for use in Uber’s autonomous driving technology. The suit alleges that Otto founder Anthony Levandowski took the information while employed at Waymo when it was still Google’s self-driving car project, and now Waymo has formally filed for an injunction against Uber’s use of the tech it says the ride-hailing company acquired in contravention of the terms of Levandowski’s employment.
Waymo is also seeking expedited discovery in the new filing, and it offered three supporting testimonies alongside its request for both the injunction and the expeditious process. These come from Waymo security engineer Gary Brown, Waymo LiDAR tech lead Pierre-Yves Droz and Waymo supply chain operations director Tim Willis. The three filings offer supporting accounts of various pieces of Waymo’s overall complaint, detailing methods allegedly used by Levandowski and technical information about why Waymo is so sure its tech is the same that Uber is now using.
In a statement provided to TechCrunch, Waymo said its decision to seek injunction reflects the many hours spent developing its original LiDAR IP. The full statement reads as follows:
Competition should be fueled by innovation in the labs and on the roads, not through unlawful actions. Given the strong evidence we have, we are asking the court step in to protect intellectual property developed by our engineers over thousands of hours and to prevent any use of that stolen IP.
The suit is based on a very serious charge of intellectual property theft, and will be yet another serious challenge Uber has to face alongside it ongoing concerns over workplace culture and criticism faced by CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick.

468,Done with Uber? Here are some alternatives,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/09/done-with-uber-here-are-some-alternatives/,2017/03/09,"
I have to admit I’m pretty reliant on Uber. With a sub par public transportation system, the ridesharing app makes it significantly easier to find my way around San Francisco.
Apart from the occasional delay or aggressive driver, the service has been pretty dependable overall. But like many users, as evidenced by the “delete Uber” social media campaign, discouraging stories about the company culture have caused me to keep re-evaluating my usage.
Fortunately, there are a handful of Uber alternatives. Here are some other options for getting around town.
Lyft
The most obvious U.S. Uber competitor is Lyft, with a service that works quite similarly. Like Uber, the app lets you hail a car and see how far away it is on the map. The prices are comparable — sometimes it’s less than Uber, sometimes it’s more. And while it started in San Francisco, the company is rapidly expanding and is now available in 300 cities.
Once known for its giant pink mustaches displayed on the outside of cars, Lyft has taken a more subtle approach with pink lights on the dashboard. Lyft’s version of UberPOOL is its Lyft Line carpooling service, for cheaper fares when you have extra time.
After failed acquisition talks, the company is said to be in talks for an additional $500 million in funding. The app is free and available on iTunes and Android.
Waze Carpool
Waze, the driving directions app owned by Google, has introduced a carpool service, specifically designed for getting to and from work. Unlike Uber and Lyft, the service is not targeting professional drivers, but regular users who want to save some money by sharing their ride. Users can enter their desired destination and see if someone else happens to be headed their way.
The app automatically calculates the fares, suggesting that it’s comparable to the price of gas. Yet because the drivers aren’t employees of Waze, they aren’t subject to the type of background checks that they would experience at Uber.
So ride at your own risk, but if you find a driver you like who happens to work  near you, it may end up saving you a lot of money and time on your commute. The app is free and on iTunes and Android
Getaround

For those of you with driver’s licenses, Getaround is a way to rent cars on-demand. From Honda to Mercedes-Benz, the app showcases a variety of types of cars and lets you pay by the hour. Once you’ve selected your vehicle, just head over to the garage or parking spot where it’s located.
It’s also a good way for car owners to make some extra money when they aren’t planning on using it. The service is currently available in select U.S. cities, including San Francisco, Portland, Chicago and Washington, D.C. The app is free and available on iPhone and Android.

469,Ford details some of the big hardware challenges to overcome in self-driving,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/09/ford-details-some-of-the-big-hardware-challenges-to-overcome-in-self-driving/,2017/03/09,"
Ford’s still keen on its mission of delivering a fleet of self-driving vehicles in operation by 2021, but there remain significant technical hurdles to overcome between now and then. Ford’s chief program engineer for autonomous vehicle development Chris Brewer detailed some of the biggest challenges his team needs to take on to ensure its self-driving cars can take the road — safely — in time for the company to meet its goals.
Brewer wrote about making sure the car components of the self-driving vehicle are still a car in terms of safety, redundancy and reliability. For one, there has to be some kind of steering control system that relies on simple mechanical control in case a power-steering system in a self-driving car fails — a tricky proposition as there’s no physical steering wheel to turn.
With power steering, in a worst-case scenario that involves a total failure of the system, there’s always the option of a human driver just cranking the wheel more to directly control the angle of the wheels. With a completely hidden drive control mechanism, where steering is controlled entirely via software, there’s still a need to figure out the best way to build in mechanical redundancy so the vehicle can be steered even when power steering gives out.
The other major challenge in terms of car hardware mentioned by Brewer is something that’s required of all equipment in vehicles in order to classify it as “automotive grade” — rigorous testing for endurance in a range of environmental conditions.
Cars aren’t like iPhones, held mostly in your pocket or bag, and often wrapped in protective casing; they’re exposed to the elements, both while driving and often while at rest as they’re parked in open-air driveways. That means building sensors and computing components that not only perform to expectations, but that are also built tough enough to endure long useful lives in extreme cold, rain, snow and desert heat.
These might not be the flashiest parts of self-driving car development — most attention is often directed at advances in neural networks and autonomous vehicle AI software. But it’s still interesting to see what Ford and its AV team believe are the big hardware challenges remaining that need to be solved between today and 2021.

470,Uber get its self-driving vehicle test permit in California,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/09/uber-get-its-self-driving-vehicle-test-permit-in-california/,2017/03/09,"
Uber is now listed as one of the companies licensed to test autonomous vehicle technology in California. The ride-hailing provider originally launched a pilot of its self-driving Volvo XC90 SUVs in San Francisco last year, but picked up and moved the test to Arizona after California’s Department of Motor Vehicles revoked the registration on its cars because it had not secured a testing permit prior to launch.
The permit from the DMV does not mean Uber will restore its full pilot in SF — which included 16 SUVs with self-driving kit, offering service mixed in with the regular fleet, so that any user might get an autonomous test vehicle when hailing a ride with the UberX app. Instead, Uber’s self-driving car deployment will be limited to two of the XC90s, and 48 specifically named drivers are able to drive the cars, according to the San Francisco Examiner.
The conditions of the permit don’t forbid Uber from resuming its passenger pickups, but the company says it’s not going to be picking up riders as it begins testing again. The company’s tech came under fire in San Francisco during the initial launch when the test vehicles were caught running red lights — Uber said that the car pictured on video was actually human-driven at the time, but a New York Times follow-up report later said it was actually in autonomous mode at the time.
Uber originally held that it didn’t technically require one of the California DMV’s autonomous test vehicle permits to use its cars on public roads because of the nature of its tests and specifics of how it was implementing its technology. It revealed that it was working with the DMV to acquire its license last week, but its position regarding the technical legality of its original tests hasn’t changed according to the company, despite its willingness to now work with the state motor vehicle authority.

471,2017 Cadillac CTS gets V2V upgrade,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/09/2017-cadillac-cts-gets-v2v-upgrade/,2017/03/09,"
The 2017 Cadillac CTS is getting vehicle-to-vehicle technology this year. The sedans will be outfitted with DSRC short-range radio communication devices to transmit and receive simple messages, including vehicles’ GPS location, speed and heading. Those messages are sent 1,000 times a second across up to about 1,000 feet.
“It’s sending out basic information that allows other CTS vehicles nearby to see each other, even if they’re not in the line of sight,” said Matthew Kirsch, the lead engineering group manager for automated driving and active safety. “The technology allows the driver to know what’s going on with other vehicles — hard braking, a disabled vehicle or slippery road conditions. Then it alerts the driver in advance of the hazard and gives the driver time to avoid by changing lanes or applying the brakes.”
Cadillac has decided to include the V2V tech as standard equipment going forward rather than making customers choose it and pay more for it as an option. “Customers might not want to pay for it,” said Steve Martin of Cadillac. He acknowledged the common chicken-and-egg problem with new automotive tech: In order for it to be worth paying for, enough people have to have it in their cars to make its usefulness plain. If you’re the only person with V2V technology, it doesn’t do you much good, so you probably won’t shell out for it as an option.
The trick is that right now, the only other vehicle that can communicate with the Cadillac CTS is another brand-new Cadillac CTS. There aren’t any other V2V-equipped vehicles at dealerships right now in the U.S., though you can buy a Prius in Japan that communicates via DSRC. Nor does this system in the CTS communicate with infrastructure or smart cities, which are mostly still in pilot program stages.
Cadillac sees itself as the advanced technology pioneer in the GM stable. V2V will eventually make its way into Chevys and other GM brands, but there was no official word on when that would happen. “We like to play nice with all of our sister brands,” said Martin.
But Cadillac is still hoping that by introducing V2V to production cars, it will start the conversation with other auto manufacturers in the U.S. “If any other manufacturer uses DSRC, we’d need to work together” to make the systems talk to each other, Kirsch said. But his team’s attitude is, “Heck yes, this is the system we’re using, so let’s make it work for both of our companies’ customers.”
“We want to bring technology that’s usable now,” Martin said, “not half a beta test that relies on other people elsewhere being able to do something with it. We’re bringing something that’s ready to use out of the box today. It shows where we put our stake in the ground.”

472,Uber says it’s reviewing use of ‘Greyball’ and won’t use it to monitor regulators,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/08/uber-says-its-reviewing-use-greyball-and-wont-use-it-to-monitor-regulators/,2017/03/08,"
Uber’s chief security officer Joe Sullivan posted an update Wednesday about the company’s use of “Greyball,” providing some details about use of the software tool, which was revealed in a New York Times report last week. Greyball was part of a program Uber designed to help it identify users who violate the terms of service of its app, preventing them from securing rides.
The NYT’s report said that Uber used it to monitor and identify app use by regulators and appointed officials who were tasked with catching Uber in the act of violating local transportation rules where Uber’s model was prohibited. The company now says it’s specifically prohibiting use of the tool for monitoring regulators, and that it’s reviewing its use of Greyball overall.
Here’s the full statement from Uber, posted by Sullivan to its company blog:

We wanted to give everyone an update on “greyballing”. This technology is used to hide the standard city app view for individual riders, enabling Uber to show that same rider a different version. It’s been used for many purposes, for example: the testing of new features by employees; marketing promotions; fraud prevention; to protect our partners from physical harm; and to deter riders using the app in violation of our terms of service.
We have started a review of the different ways this technology has been used to date. In addition, we are expressly prohibiting its use to target action by local regulators going forward. Given the way our systems are configured, it will take some time to ensure this prohibition is fully enforced. We’ve had a number of organizations reach out for information and we will be working to respond to their inquiries once we have finished our review.

473,2017 Land Rover Discovery: hardcore tech for normcore drivers,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/07/2017-land-rover-discovery-hardcore-tech-for-normcore-drivers/,2017/03/07,"
The all-new 2017 Land Rover Discovery — Disco to its friends — is packed from skid plates to sunroof with technology. Most of this tech falls into two segments: stuff most people will use all the time and stuff almost no one will use in their lifetimes. In the first category is the Activity Key that allows you to unlock the Discovery with a wristband; in the second, All-Terrain Progress Control for navigating outrageously difficult terrain at, like, 3 mph.
Let’s talk about the usable tech first. The Land Rover InControl Touch Pro infotainment system is a big improvement over Land Rover’s previous systems. It has a 10-inch horizontal screen that’s easy to scroll through, plus quick keys at the bottom, so you can always get back to the home screen. Its navigation system offers door-to-door routing, with directions from your parked Discovery to your destination on your smartphone.
2017 Land Rover Discovery touch screen
The system also has a Commute Mode that learns your usual routes. Once it understands how you get from home to work five mornings a week, it can suggest routes that circumvent traffic or accidents. And if you want, it can send messages to your coworkers to let them know what your arrival time will be.
The Discovery has ADAS features similar to many other luxury vehicles, including park assist, pedestrian detection and automatic cruise control. Also, like many other vehicles, you can unlock the Discovery from a smartwatch app. But the designers of the Discovery assume its buyers are an active, adventurous bunch. So they created the Activity Key, a rubbery strap for your wrist. You can leave your keys locked inside the Discovery at the trail head, do your Sunday long run in the woods and then unlock the Discovery when you get back by holding the band up to the “D” on the rear tailgate. Brought your dog with you on that long run? You can lower the rear suspension to make it easier for her to jump in the back.
Which brings us to the truly adventurous things the Discovery can do. It’s a Land Rover, so yeah, it’s got clearance for days and can drive through almost three feet of water. It’s got full-time four-wheel drive with low gearing for serious off-roading. The suspension can be raised and lowered more than two inches at the push of a button.
It also has All-Terrain Progress Control, which takes over the engine and braking functions at super slow speeds (1.2 mph to 19 mph). Press the ATPC button to set the speed, and you can concentrate on steering over boulders or down roller-coaster-grade inclines on sand dunes. Hill Descent Control and Gradient Release Control come in handy here, too. All but the most hardcore Discovery owners will ever need ATPC or anything like it, though they’ll likely be glad for the easy switch to different terrain modes for muddy unpaved roads or winter commutes that turn suddenly snowy.

474,"Airbus reveals a modular, self-piloting flying car concept",https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/07/airbus-reveals-a-modular-self-piloting-flying-car-concept/,2017/03/07,"
Airbus has been talking about its Vahana flying autonomous vehicle project for a while now, but at this year’s Geneva Motor Show, it’s showing off a concept design created in partnership with Italdesign. The demonstration vehicle offers modular functionality, meaning it an operate both on the ground and in the air, and Airbus thinks it’s one potential answer to the growing problem of urban traffic congestion.
As you can see, it’s suitably sci-fi in its design sensibilities, but it’s designed with practicality in mind. The concept vehicle is intended to work with others to form a network that can be summoned on demand, with passengers hailing a ride form an app on their mobile device. The capsule-based design can connect to either ground or air conveyance modules, letting customers specific their preferred method of transit. It’s also designed to be used in concert with other, existing transportation methods for maximum efficiency.
Airbus and Italdesign call their creation the ‘Pop.Up System,’ which includes the artificial intelligence platform that uses what it knows about any individual user, and available routes and transit options to determine the best travel options. The main vehicle itself is a passenger capsule, which holds the rider and which can be paired with either ground and air modules, as well as, Airbus suggests, with hyperloop systems down the line once that tech becomes more widely available.

There’s a third part of Pop.Up that ensures this whole project touches all bases when it comes to current tech hype – an interface that will respond and interact with the user in a “fully virtual environment” while in transit. They’ve thought of everything.
Well, except making this thing real: It’s very much still a concept, though its 8.5-foot long monocoque carbon-fibre passenger pod is built-to scale and on the show floor at Geneva, as are the wheeled ground module and quadcopter drone air transit system.
It’s unlikely to ever be ferrying passengers around, at least in this state, and in the near future, but it’s a very cool design that can at least make us want to work a bit harder to get to a place where it is a viable, everyday option for navigating our expanding and increasingly dense cities.

475,Goodyear’s AI tire concept can read the road and adapt on the fly,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/07/goodyears-ai-tire-concept-can-read-the-road-and-adapt-on-the-fly/,2017/03/07,"
Goodyear is thinking ahead to how tires – yes, tires – might change as autonomous driving technology alters vehicle design, and as available technologies like in-vehicle and embedded machine learning and AI make it possible to do more with parts of the car that were previously pretty static, like its wheels.
Its new Eagle 360 Urban tire concept design builds on the work it revealed last year with its Edge 360 concept tire, which re-imagined the tire as a sphere, capable of providing autonomous cars with the ability to move in any direction at a moment’s notice, without having to worry about turning arcs and altering the angle of wheels.
This new Urban version, unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show going on this week, adds a “bionic skin” to the mix, which includes embedded sensors throughout to detect things like a change in surface type for the road itself, say from asphalt to packed dirt, or to take note of things like snow and rain.

Using data collected by these sensors, the tire could then activate built-in actuators to change the shape of the surface and tread of the tire. It’s a bit like how electrical signals tell your muscles to change shape when you flex or grip, but all done at the behest of onboard virtual intelligence telling the tire what shape will best help it maintain traction and control given the current state of the road beneath it.
Imagine a future where you don’t need winter tires even if you live in Minnesota, or where your Tesla adapts to have racing slicks when you’re taking it out for a track day automatically. Intelligence and adaptability built into a tire is also another way that autonomous vehicle makers can take risk out of the equation for the most unpredictable parts of driving, including how weather impacts the road.

Localized AI applications like this are made possible by a growing category of embedded processor and GPU options from companies including Nvidia that make it possible to enact machine learning “at the edge,” or where sensing actually happens, instead of having to shuttle that information back to big data centres and then out again.

476,Spacer acquires Roost to grow its peer-to-peer parking empire,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/07/spacer-acquires-roost-to-grow-its-peer-to-peer-parking-empire/,2017/03/07,"
Australian peer-to-peer car parking marketplace Spacer has acquired U.S.-based Roost, which provides the same services stateside from its San Francisco-based headquarters. It’s a move that lets Spacer make its entry into the U.S. market without having to establish its own office and start from scratch.
The deal will include rebranding all of Roost’s existing U.S. service offerings under the Spacer name, and Roost CEO Jonathan Gillon will also be departing the company to focus on building new companies as part of the deal. The plan is to expand Roost’s U.S. operations to SF, Chicago and Washington, D.C. as Spacer’s initial U.S. market entry, before expanding across the entire country.
Peer-to-peer on-demand parking rentals is a market with a lot of potential in urban areas where available spaces are at a premium. The cost of renting from legacy parking providers, and via spots made available by condo owners and others who have spaces but aren’t using the, are either cost-prohibitive, restrictive in terms of term of commitment required, or simply too difficult to find (many condo owners just post availability on internal notice boards, for instance).
This deal also carries over existing partnerships Roost has with Zipcar, Enterprise and Maven Drive for allocating spots. There’s potential, too, with this kind of marketplace in terms of providing key services and infrastructure in an autonomous driving future, when roving networks of self-driving vehicles will need to occasionally find places to stop and recharge, when in need of power or not in demand. A peer-to-peer parking marketplace might provide the perfect network to provide the basis for such needs.

477,Ford begins testing 3D printing large car parts for cost-effective customization,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/05/ford-begins-testing-3d-printing-large-car-parts-for-cost-effective-customization/,2017/03/05,"
The spoiler on a future Ford car you buy might be 3D-printed. Ford Motor Company announced on Monday that they’ve begun testing 3D printing of large-scale parts, using tech provided by 3D printing industry giant Stratasys. The pilot project is designed to find out how Ford might be able to use 3D printing to make large parts, tooling and components at relatively small volumes, where it normally wouldn’t make sense to even bother because of how much it would cost.
If these tests with Stratasys’ commercial-grade Infinite Build 3D printer go well, that could open up a whole new world of opportunity for niche vehicle lines, vehicle upgrade options and more. That’s very handy in some of the fields where Ford currently operates, including racer manufacture, and in building prototype and concept vehicles rapidly and with less investment required.
But for the ordinary consumer, it could mean custom rides off the production line in the future, with made-to-order parts and aesthetic upgrades that are truly unique. Commercial 3D printing is appealing because it doesn’t require use of the kinds of moulds built to form plastic body panel parts like spoilers today. Building those moulds is so expensive up front that it would never make sense for a car maker to build them for singe or even small-batch use, unless the customer in question was willing to pay far, far more than the price of your average vehicle.
3D printed parts don’t just have cost benefits – they also offer weight savings. Ford estimates that a 3D-printed spoiler could be less than half the weight of the equivalent made from a metal casting, for instance, so you can extrapolate that a car where many of its external body pieces are 3D-printed could enjoy greatly decreased weight overall, and better fuel efficiency as a result.
So far, Ford’s just testing this tech at its Research and Innovation Center in Dearborn Mich., but if all goes well it could herald a big change in the way the company makes cars.

478,Toyota’s new autonomous test car 2.0 is a tricked out Lexus,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/03/toyotas-new-autonomous-test-car-2-0-is-a-tricked-out-lexus/,2017/03/03,"
Toyota’s Research Institute (TRI) houses some of the automakers most ambitious future-focused projects, and the R&D organization debuted its new second-generation autonomous safety technology research vehicle on Friday. The car debuted at Toyota’s Prius Challenge event in Sonoma, California, which is a Silicon Valley forum designed to bring entrepreneurs, roboticists and more together with TRI.
The new vehicle is also the first self-driving test platform built entirely by TRI, and its intended purpose is to help the research group test and explore a wide range of safety features and autonomous technologies. It’s loadout includes a drive-by-wire interface, as well as layered LiDAR, radar and camera sensors to reduce dependency on pre-populated high-def maps. It’s also designed to be fairly modular, meaning it can improve on the fly when upgrades to individual parts are available and can be swapped in.

Toyota’s first test car got its debut at CES in 2013, so the team has had some time to improve. The new Lexus LS 600hL upon which the car is based is just one of the more obvious examples of the changes. The vehicle is designed to help TRI pursue development of both its Chauffeur and Guardian systems, which are Level 5/Level 4 (fully autonomous) and very advanced driver assistance features, respectively.
Guardian’s goal is to clue in drivers when they’re needed to intervene, via active monitoring of the driver assistance, while handing control entirely for a significant percentage of time. The Guardian system has more near-term potential, according to TRI lead Gill Pratt, and could get much smarter over time with plenty of immediate life-saving potential before full autonomy via things like Chauffeur are feasible for broad deployment.

479,GM’s new Maven Reserve service offers monthly vehicle rentals,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/03/gms-new-maven-reserve-service-offers-monthly-vehicle-rentals/,2017/03/03,"
Alternative models to car ownership now abound, and GM’s putting one more on the table: Maven Reserve, an offering within its Maven on-demand rental service that lets users rent new GM cars for 28 days at a time, complete with parking, insurance and $100 in gas credit. These will cost you, however: The Chevrolet Tahoe is one of the initial offerings, with a $1,500 flat rate for the month, and the less expensive Chevrolet Volt is also available – but still runs $1,100 per month.
These vehicles include a lot of optional service extras that GM would normally charge more for on top of the price of a new vehicle or lease, however, including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto infotainment options, as well as SiriusXM satellite radio, 4G LTE WiFi. You also get access to support from “Maven advisors,” who can provide answers to questions, roadside assistance and handle emergency situations via GM’s OnStar service.
At first, GM will be offering Maven Reserve only in LA and San Francisco, both beginning Friday. These initial markets were chosen, according to the automaker, because of their entrepreneurial and entertainment market demographics – the theory being that the convenience of long-term on-demand rentals will appeal to groups of people whose routines and commutes change with fair frequency. These areas also tend to house a lot of long-term work placement employees from other markets, so it’s a suitable choice for Maven in that way, too.
Maven suggests some other possible use cases from either location: The Tahoe is a good fit for hauling production equipment to location shoots, for instance, and the Volt can manage the San Francisco to Silicon Valley commute with relative ease thanks to its extended-range hybrid electric drivetrain. Tahoe and Volt were also chosen for more data-driven reasons: They’re some of the most popular cars in the existing Maven City lineup for short-term rentals.
This isn’t the first time a GM brand is dipping its toes into longer-term rentals: Cadillac has been testing its Book by Cadillac long-term on-demand rental service in New York. That also asks for a $1,500 monthly fee, but is designed for multi-month use and offers subscribers the option to choose from a range of Cadillac vehicles which they can switch out as needed.
At $1,100 and $1,500 per month respectively for Tahoe and Volt monthly rentals, respectively, Maven Reserve isn’t going to be for everyone – but if you start adding up the cost of lease, insurance and that $100 gas credit, plus payment for a parking spot in these busy cities, and you’re hitting that mark pretty quick. The best cost offset might be the fact that you only pay when you need it – unlike a lease, which you’re stuck with for the duration of your term.
Maven Reserve also feels like one part of a hybrid model that will provide an array of options in concert to replace ownership: Maven City, and forthcoming on-demand ride-sharing GM is planning to launch with autonomous vehicles further on down the road can work together with Maven Reserve to suit the different needs of the same individual at different times. Maven may have started life as essentially just a GM-branded Zipcar equivalent, but it’s quickly evolving into much more.

480,Uber will apply for a self-driving test permit in California,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/02/uber-will-apply-for-a-self-driving-test-permit-in-california/,2017/03/02,"
Uber is now in the process of getting a permit from the California DMV to resume testing its self-driving vehicles on public state roads. Uber started testing its self-driving Volvo XC90 SUVs in San Francisco last year – but the state DMV ultimately opposed the tests since Uber had not applied for its autonomous testing permit prior to beginning service.
While Uber took its test fleet of XC90s on the road to nearby Arizona, where Governor Doug Ducey and regulators welcomed them with open arms – the company said at the time that it was committed to California, and reiterated that position in a statement provided by a spokesperson to TechCrunch today:
These cars are legally registered and are being driven manually. We are taking steps to complete our application to apply for a DMV testing permit. As we said in December, Uber remains 100 percent committed to California.
As Uber notes, the self-driving vehicles made a return to SF streets recently – but they aren’t employed in picking up passengers. Instead, they’re being used to map the city for improvements to local maps for autonomous driving and other navigation purposes. Uber self-driving sedans have been spotted on streets in SF since the ban by local residents, but the company also now says two of its Volvos have had their registrations reinstated by the DMV, following their revocation last year.
Uber hasn’t yet applied for the permit, as implied in the statement, and first reported by The Mercury News. But the DMV tells the Mercury that it’s working with Uber on the application process, and the company does intend to go forward.
Despite that, its views on the legality of its tests and requirements regarding self-driving testing haven’t changed – Uber’s original reasoning for not applying for the permit was that it didn’t require this special permission under the letter of the law. Still, it now appears focused on the pragmatic task of redeploying its test vehicles regardless of its position on legality, something that makes a lot of sense given the wealth of other challenges the company is currently facing.

481,Daimler leads ChargePoint’s new $82M round for EV charging network growth,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/02/daimler-leads-chargepoints-new-82m-round-for-ev-charging-network-growth/,2017/03/02,"
Campbell, Calif.-based ChargePoint secured a new $82 million funding round, led by automaker Daimler. The new funding will help ChargePoint expand its network of electric vehicle charging stations in Europe, as the company pursues its goal of making charging stations for EVs as readily available and convenient as gas stations.
The funding round also includes existing investors BMW i Ventures, Lines Capital, Rho Capital and Braemar Energy Ventures. But having Daimler join brings a new board member from the automaker, Axel Harries, who previously served on Daimler’s commercial vehicles business, and who now works on its connected, electric mobility services strategy. That makes this investor, and this new senior board resource, very strategic as far as partnerships go.
ChargePoint has already had good success at home in North America, with more than 33,000 charging ports across its various stations and installations. It’s a big provider of corporate charging spots, too — the kind you see in parking lots for large tech companies in the Valley, for instance — with 6,500 corporate customers in total.
Daimler is already partnering with Ford, BMW and Volkswagen Group to build out a fast-charge network for EVs in Europe, and the company is also building out its EQ brand, which is entirely focused on electric mobility.

482,Chevrolet offers vehicle owners a $20 monthly unlimited in-car data plan,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/02/chevrolet-offers-vehicle-owners-a-20-monthly-unlimited-in-car-data-plan/,2017/03/02,"
The in-car data business is booming, and Chevrolet is stepping up to help meet demand with a new, prepaid $20 monthly unlimited data plan – the first unlimited data plan for car owners from one of the big three in the U.S. The plan will let people connect in-car to OnStar 4G LTE Wi-Fi (in models that offer this, which includes all of its lineup for late-model vehicles).
It’s a big move for Chevrolet and OnStar because data use is on the rise – Chevrolet says that its customers used around 200 percent more data during 2016 than they did in 2015, with a significant portion of that growth coming from the second half of the year.
Chevy’s OnStar LTE connection is supplied by AT&T, and does not require any long-term commitment, so you can cancel at any time. The tech is obviously designed to be enjoyed by passengers, not drivers, but it’s increasingly in demand, especially for families with kids who want to stay connected while on the road.
Connected vehicles provide additional revenue streams for carmakers, so that could be the reason Chevrolet is willing to forgo more income from different pricing tiers in this instance. It should also boost that strong growth the GM-owned carmaker is already seeing in terms of demand for in-car data, which will help long-term with subsidizing the cost of a connected fleet with consumer subscriptions.

483,Tesla responds to harassment lawsuit filed by female engineer in 2016,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/28/tesla-responds-to-harassment-lawsuit-filed-by-female-engineer-in-2016/,2017/02/28,"
The Guardian published a new interview with Tesla engineer and current employee AJ Vandermeyden on Tuesday, wherein Vandermeyden lays out what she sees as a history of discriminatory treatment in a male-dominated work environment. Vandermeyden’s new statements were made in the context of a suit she filed last year against Tesla, and follow major revelations at Uber of systemic harassment issues at the ride-hailing company.
Vandermeyden says that she was often the only woman in meetings with as many as 40 or 50 employees, and also told the Guardian that all C-level exec positions are occupied by men, with only two VP positions out of more than 30 held by women. Vandermeyden’s complaint regarding her own treatment revolves around being passed up for promotions, along with other female employees, in favor of men who were equally or less qualified.
She also notes that she specifically came up with a unique solution to a quality testing oversight, missed by more senior employees and supervisors, but that this did not prevent other male employees from being promoted above her. Vandermeyden also detailed a 2015 incident in which a group of multiple male colleagues where “whistling” and “hooting and hollering” at her and a female coworker from a platform above as they passed by.
Vandermeyden also echoed some of the concern expressed by Uber employees regarding that company’s use of its human resources department, but she also maintains that she agrees with Tesla’s overall vision, and “really [does] believe they are doing great things.”
When contacted, Tesla provided the following statement to TechCrunch regarding the new statements made by Vandermeyden to the Guardian:
Tesla is committed to creating a positive workplace environment that is free of discrimination for all our employees. Ms. Vandermeyden joined Tesla in a sales position in 2013, and since then, despite having no formal engineering degree, she has sought and moved into successive engineering roles, beginning with her work in Tesla’s paint shop and eventually another role in General Assembly. Even after she made her complaints of alleged discrimination, she sought and was advanced into at least one other new role, evidence of the fact that Tesla is committed to rewarding hard work and talent, regardless of background. When Ms. Vandermeyden first brought her concerns to us over a year ago, we immediately retained a neutral third party, Anne Hilbert of EMC2Law, to investigate her claims so that, if warranted, we could take appropriate action to address the issues she raised. After an exhaustive review of the facts, the independent investigator determined that Ms. Vandermeyden’s “claims of gender discrimination, harassment, and retaliation have not been substantiated.” Without this context, the story presented in the original article is misleading.
As mentioned, Tesla received a full report from its independent auditor that suggested no substantial basis for Vandermeyden’s claims in its findings. The legal action remains ongoing, and Vandermeyden remains a Tesla employee.

484,Volvo’s new XC60 will automatically steer as well as brake to avoid crashes,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/28/volvos-new-xc60-will-automatically-steer-as-well-as-brake-to-avoid-crashes/,2017/02/28,"
The new Volvo XC60 does more on behalf of the driver in order to prevent accidents, moving the SUV further along the continuum toward full autonomy. The new model of the car, which is making its debut at the Geneva Motor Show, adds automated steering in tandem with automatic braking to avoid collisions, as well as a few other tricks that involve software taking the wheel when it believes it’s necessary.
The SUV also will alert drivers when they’re drifting out of a designated driving lane, and will actually automatically steer them back into their lane if it detects that doing so will take it out of the path of a vehicle that might otherwise collide with the driver’s own car. The system will operate between 60 and 140kh/h — so at highway driving speeds, essentially.
Run-off Road Mitigation
Finally, an optional blind spot information system add-on will let drivers know about cars that are in their blind spots, as before — but now it’ll also take action to steer the car away from the path of those vehicles and back into the safety of their own lane.
We’re really starting to see the focus in most of these ADAS features shift from making the driver aware they need to do something, to skipping a step and manipulating the vehicle on their own. It’s a change that could unsettle some drivers who are more used to taking control.
Volvo’s being especially aggressive about implementing ADAS features, including a large animal detection system that will help make sure your S90 doesn’t run over any T-Rexes.

485,BMW says ‘nein’ to Android Auto,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/28/bmw-says-nein-to-android-auto/,2017/02/28,"
Like CES, the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona also now attracts its fair share of car makers. Ford was an early adopter a few years ago, and now others are joining the fray, too. I sat down with Dieter May, BMW’s senior vice president of Digital Services and Business Models (in an i3, of course).
During our conversation, we touched upon quite a few topics, ranging from self-driving cars, to the future of car ownership and the new business models that in-car technology enables. “We offer [Apple’s] CarPlay as an option but not Android Auto,” he said. “We believe the changes that are coming to the inside of the car and the user experience — like self-driving cars — you have to control the customer interface. That’s part of the brand experience and for that, I don’t want to have an Android screen and I especially want to be able to deeply integrate these systems.”
He expects that the car of the future (especially when we’re talking about autonomous cars) will offer far more personalization options, which in turn will enable new business models, too.
“If you have six screens in the car, you also get gesture control, voice control with a personal assistant, etc.,” May said. “You need to have control over that user experience — maybe you can get away with it if you’re a ‘mass producer,’ but not in the premium segment.”

To do this, BMW built its own cloud platform that saves user preferences and other data about a car online and then allows drivers to take their profiles and preferences with them from car to car, for example.
Instead of Android Auto (and to some degree, CarPlay), BMW is focusing on A2A (Apps for Auto), which is part of the company’s ConnectedDrive platform. That allows apps to integrate deeply (and safely) with the car and, because it provides a stable developer interface, it allows the company to innovate faster, according to May. That’s mostly because it allows his group to work on its part of the in-car technology stack without having to stick to the slower innovation cycle that dominates the actual hardware part of the car business.
One area where BMW is far more excited about working with third parties, though, is personal assistants. The company already showed off prototype integrations with Amazon’s Alexa and Cortana, but May believes that none of them are currently great for everything, so what he wants to build is a system that can talk to all of them.
“We were the first car manufacturer who launched this at scale with Amazon because we were able to easily integrate it with our cloud platform,” he explained when I asked him about BMW’s work with Alexa in the car. He also acknowledged, though, that BMW — just like any other car manufacturer — has a lot of work left to do. “I believe this is a unique opportunity to position ourselves against the existing app ecosystems. It gives us a new opportunity because you’re not so dependent on them but new ecosystems are also on the rise. […] But if you’re sitting in a 7-Series BMW, you don’t want your customers to have to say ‘Hey Alexa, roll up the windows. And that’s all about the brand, of course.”

In his view, all of the assistants have different strengths. Bixby will probably be great for IoT and controlling your Samsung devices, while Google will be great for search, Amazon for e-commerce and Cortana for connecting the car to the Skype and LinkedIn ecosystem. “In real life, you also talk about different topics with different people,” he argued, and added that he doesn’t believe one company will be able to serve all needs equally well. For a car manufacturer like BMW, that means it has to figure out how to integrate all of them inside and outside the car.
How long will it take before we’ll see this in the car? “Our product cycle is pretty much CES-to-CES, May joked. “A year ago we showed Alexa and in August it was on our platform and scaled up. The same goes for Cortana. We’ve demonstrated it and by next CES, we should have a production-ready version.” Indeed, he gets an annual budget for his group and the group is then expected to deliver by the end of that year. That may not look like rapid innovation, but compared to what product cycles in the car industry traditionally look like, it’s extremely fast. His group plans from quarter to quarter, while it typically takes a few years to get a car from concept to production run.
Because of this, having a platform with stable developer interfaces is key because it allows the developers to gain a degree of independence from the underlying car platform.
Like other manufacturers, BMW hopes that its platform allows it to extend its relationship with those customers beyond the showroom.
May has some interesting ideas about new business models, too, especially now that BMW — like other car manufacturers — is focusing on extending its relationship with its customers beyond the showroom. If all of a car’s features are controlled by software, after all, then you end up with lots of new features you can sell, too. BMW isn’t interested in sharing revenue from hotel bookings through its in-car platform, though. They have to be about the driving experience. What May is thinking about is selling cars that already feature all the hardware options but then give you the option to buy access to extra features, like a heated car seat or an extra 50 horsepower for that road trip through the Alps (and your car could even suggest this because it knows if there is a lot of traffic or that you’re taking a hilly road or may want to speed down the German Autobahn).
In May’s perfect world, every feature in the car would have an IP address. You’d only produce one SKU of the car and then you could enable and disable features as needed — maybe forever or under a subscription model.
This, May says, makes more sense for a company that operates at BMW’s scale than making 2 Euros for a booking through TripAdvisor.
Self-driving cars will change how people think about cars and car ownership. May acknowledged as much, and noted that the BMW of the future may measure its success not by how many cars it sells but how many miles per month people drive its cars. “It’s a really exciting industry right now. The convergence of car and internet technologies, artificial intelligence, autonomous driving — they are all coming together,” said May. “That’s a core industry for Europe and Germany. That opens up plenty of opportunities but also risks.” To compete, BMW hired hundreds of people — but not in Silicon Valley, because May doesn’t believe it can compete with Google and the other internet companies for talent there. “These are 24-year-olds who want to work somewhere for two years as a short gig and then move on. Those are not the people we need — and I can’t exactly promise them that we’ll have a massive IPO that’ll make them millions, either.”
He doesn’t seem to think that Uber and others are an immediate concern for the traditional car manufacturers, but he’s also clearly keeping an eye on that. “But I’m convinced that if you’re not fast enough, you’ll definitely lose. That’s a fact.”
BMWs tend to be fast, but like all of its competitors, the company is acutely aware that it is now operating in a rapidly changing market — and that gives competitors a chance to take market share away from it.

486,Ford’s new self-driving van concept is like a rolling hive for delivery drones,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/28/fords-new-self-driving-van-concept-is-like-a-rolling-hive-for-delivery-drones/,2017/02/28,"
Ford’s new “Autolivery” van concept has a terrible name, but is actually based on interesting core ideas. The van is yet another result of Ford’s fruitful “last mile mobility” internal employee challenge, and this one pairs an electric self-driving van with autonomous drones that nest within to help transport packages that last few feet to a customer’s door.
The van from Ford is very much a concept – less real than Mercedes’ physical concept and the UPS drone delivery vehicle that the company debuted this month. It’s currently only possible to check out how it works first-hand in VR, and even then only at MWC in Barcelona. But the idea is clearly making sense to a lot of different automakers and logistics providers, which is a sign that the idea has legs.
Even if it’s definitely interesting from a technical perspective, and makes sense in terms of cost and efficiency, there’s still a lot of regulatory ground to cover before something like this can exist. But self-driving trucks don’t worry about waiting in traffic, and self-navigating drones don’t just give up an attempted delivery because it’s close to the end of shift or there’s a construction vehicle blocking the road.
Ford’s also still set on putting fleets of self-driving vehicles on roads by 2021, so that’s half the job won. Nested drones allowed to fly free from within is only a matter of time after that.

Nissan is testing its self-driving vehicles on European streets for the first time, with a rollout begun Monday in London. The tests, reported by Reuters, involved modified Nissan Leaf electric vehicles equipped with a range of sensors and onboard computing power, going as fast as 50 miles per-hour, and transitioning between small local roads and larger, multi-lane thoroughfares.
London was selected as the site of the first European tests because of the city’s fairly open attitude towards autonomous technology testing, Reuters reports. London’s TFL and police services are working closely with Nissan on the test, meaning the automaker has to give those agencies a head up regarding its test routes, and maintain a complete log of outings for full disclosure to the public authorities.
Nissan’s testing efforts have already been underway both in Tokyo and in Silicon Valley. The company has been working on its driverless tech for a while now, and we’ve heard that they’re sourcing tech and talent from a variety of sources to make sure their efforts stand out from the crowd, including NASA.

Ford’s putting traditional TV service into its vehicles, starting with the Expedition, which gets streaming cable capabilities thanks to a partnership with Slingbox. This will pipe that hot cable into the Expedition’s headrests, letting passengers in the back get all their entertainment without interruption while on the road.
Ford’s live TV streaming is just one part of its connectivity additions to the 2018 Expedition, which also offers a Wi-Fi hotspot option with support for connections of up to 10 devices simultaneously, with a range of 50 feet around the car, so that you can park and play if you’re camping or tailgating for instance.
The streaming system is the more interesting and unique component, however, and works with two 8-inch screens embedded in the back of the front seat headrests. These work with SlingPlayer on a mobile app to control streaming from a home Slingbox system, which essentially passes on a live satellite or cable feed, complete with remote control. The displays also include remote controls, and wireless headsets (one per screen), with an additional wired headphone connector for multiple viewers per display.
For all the merits of on-demand streaming media, live TV still has a ton of appeal and a special place in the hearts of sports fans, so this could be an interesting and appealing extra for a decent group of buyers. Just remember you can’t drive and watch at the same time.

489,Starsky Robotics’ autonomous transport trucks also give drivers remote control,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/28/starsky-robotics-autonomous-transport-trucks-also-give-drivers-remote-control/,2017/02/28,"
Starsky Robotics has already used its autonomous trucks for paying gigs, including a 5,000-lb haul covering 140 miles, with 120 of those driven by the truck itself. It’s also moved trailers around a truck yard without anyone behind the wheel, a task that’s usually a time-consuming chore for someone or a team who has to get in and out of cabs. And Starsky’s tech doesn’t want to replace human divers – it wants to increase their quality of life.
The company is using autonomous capabilities where it can, but it’s also employing remote control driving when its trucks leave highway stretches, meaning a driver doesn’t have to be fully dedicated to a single vehicle in one physical location in order to do their job. They also don’t need to be present for the long miles of uneventful highway driving, which theoretically means safer roads due to less fatigue, and, Starsky claims, local driver schedules with higher, long-haul driver pay.
Starsky’s tech is also looking to make an impact now, by using components and techniques that are currently available at prices which are palatable to truck purchasers and manufacturers. That’s why it isn’t using LiDAR in its system, since it says it believes waiting for the cost curve to come down on that tech, which uses lasers to map surroundings to very high resolution, is “a moral hazard.”

Instead, Starsky’s solution uses computer vision, radar and software acting in tandem, which it says is “well understood,” and means it can start adding safety benefits to driving now, instead of way down the road. Likewise, Starsky says its focus on building small robots that can control the existing control mechanisms of a truck physically, instead of on overhauling the truck with modified control systems, actually means more control functionality is possible – and retrofitting existing vehicles is easier.
Starsky has already run a highway haul, as mentioned, which is the first step towards offering regular service in the course of the next few months. It’s also going to aim to get human drivers out of some vehicles entirely by the end of 2017. The company started up its efforts in 2015, and has $3.75 million in funding from some high-profile investors, including Y Combinator, Sam Altman, Trucks VC, Data Collective and more.

Honda opened its new Innovation Lab Tokyo to press for the first time on Tuesday, and also marked the occasion by announcing the debut of a new tech R&D group within the facility called R&D Center X. The new unit will begin operations in April, and will focus on the kind of cutting edge stuff you might imagine it would – robotics, mobility services and systems, artificial intelligence and energy tech including batteries.
But it’s not just a pie-in-the-sky research lab; Honda’s focus with R&D Center X will be on delivering results that can be used in market, and the company told Automotive News we could see results from the new group’s efforts as early as next year in robotics, and by 2020 for a novel development in the field of autonomous driving.
R&D Center X sounds like it will also lean heavily on Honda’s Xcelerator program, since it’s going to be looking to collaborate with outside companies where it makes sense. The Xcelerator program, Honda’s own support and scouting program for startups, will likely prove a worthwhile pipeline for finding some of those external partners.
Honda is also basing Center X in Tokyo, not Silicon Valley, by design – Japan’s engineering schools provide a wealth of top-flight talent, the company says, while it can still tap into SV via work with external sources.
For a car company to not embrace its tech side fully these days is an absolute mistake, and Honda’s approach, which includes a heavy focus on R&D in general, along with this more speculative and creative play, makes a ton of sense.

491,Dubuc Motors gets SEC approval for equity crowdfunding,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/28/dubuc-motors-gets-sec-approval-for-equity-crowdfunding/,2017/02/28,"
Dubuc Motors, makers of the Tomahawk all-electric supercar prototype, recently announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had approved its filing for equity crowdfunding under the US JOBS Act Regulation A+.
The company began a Testing the Waters campaign in 2016, when it revealed the Tomahawk prototype, and raised $6.1 million in initial funding reservations. Now that the campaign is in the live offering phase, the company can convert those reservations into equity shares. Dubuc Motors simultaneously filed for a Regulation S, which allows investors in the US and around the world to kick in as little as $200 each. “And we’ll build from there,” said Dubuc founder and COO Mike Kakogiannakis in a phone interview.
Dubuc likes to point out that it’s the first EV company to approved by the SEC to sell equity shares this way. But if Regulation A+ sounds familiar, that might be because the gasoline-powered three-wheeler to (maybe) be built by Elio Motors used the same mechanism in the US JOBS Act to raise $17 million. But Elio Motors has had to push its production and delivery back a few times, and at the end of 2016, they seemed to be underwater. “It’s a different business model,” founder and CEO Mario Dubuc said. “It might hinder our efforts.”
Prerevenue, Kakogiannakis said, there were about 30 people who worked on the prototype. In the next few months, the team will grow to 100, and the production model will be unveiled in Las Vegas at CES 2018. Production is expected to begin in 2018, when Kakogiannakis predicts a team of about 150, including workers on the Tomahawk production line. (Where that production line will be located is still in negotiations.)
The Tomahawk is a 2+2 exotic sports car intended to fit four adults — as tall as six-four in the front seats and five-nine in the back — and even accommodate growing families. “We wanted to target a segment out of the big automakers’ reach,” Kakogiannakis said. He and Dubuc started the company as a side gig over a decade ago and quit their jobs in 2013 to build Dubuc Motors full time.
They see the Tomahawk as a “complement to Tesla‘s model line rather than a competitor,” Kakogiannakis said. The car will have similar performance to the Model S, with a 0-60 mph time of 3 seconds and a 160 mph max speed. But it will have “a bit more range,” according to Kakogiannakis, with a possible 370 miles. “Among EVs, we are alone,” he said, “but Ferrari and Lamborghini could be competitors.”
They’ll also build the Tomahawk in supercar numbers — only 1500 units are planned over the next five years. The cars will have less than supercar prices, though, with a target of $125,000 to $150,000, depending on how many extras buyers want to add. Safety and sensors will be present, as will advanced technology — but not autonomous driving. “As a sports car, the Tomahawk is meant to be felt,” Dubuc said. “Maybe we’ll work on autonomy in the future for other models.”

492,Testing Volvo’s large animal detection,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/28/testing-volvos-large-animal-detection/,2017/02/28,"
I’ve tested Volvo’s Pilot Assist and Park Assist Pilot in the Volvo XC90 and Pilot Assist II when I briefly drove the Volvo S90 last fall. But I hadn’t yet had a chance to test the Large Animal Detection system. So I enlisted a menacing five-foot T. rex rather than driving around on rural roads waiting for a deer to jump out at me.
I’ve included a short video clip below, but it requires some caveats. The first thing to know is that the test worked. When I drove up to the T. rex at 8-10 mph, the brakes engaged fully and a blinking red-and-white car symbol appeared in the HUD. It did stop the car, though I couldn’t help but hit the brake pedal when the warnings went off. So maybe I helped? But the system did its job.
The issue was with the test dinosaur. As you’ll see in the clip, he falls over, but that’s because it was a breezy day and he’s filled with air. The Volvo did not hit him, though it does come very close. I do wonder about the short stopping distance; it may be because my large animal wasn’t really moving until he fell over so the sensors didn’t pick up on his large animal-ness sooner.
I’ll keep working on T. rex to make him more test-worthy for animal and pedestrian sensors. Because so far, none of my friends or family have volunteered to walk in front of a car with advanced technology to see if it stops in time.

493,Car companies are now coming to MWC too,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/27/car-companies-are-now-coming-to-mwc-too/,2017/02/27,"
There are four automotive manufacturers at the Mobile World Congress 2017 in Barcelona this year: Daimler, BMW, Ford, and Peugeot. And if CES is any indicator, expect more to follow in the next few years.
Peugeot is going the furthest in bringing a world-premiere concept car to MWC, the Peugeot Instinct. The car demonstrates the company’s partnership with the Samsung Artik Cloud IoT connectivity platform, which aggregates data from smartwatches, smartphones, social networks, and more. The Peugeot and another partner, the data science company Sentiance, use the data to make profiles of the vehicle’s user. (Since the goal here is autonomous mobility, “driver” isn’t really the right word.)
Mercedes-Benz is showcasing its CASE strategy — Connected, Autonomous, Shared & Service, and Electric Drive — with several products under the Daimler umbrella, including Moovel and Car2go. Visitors to the booth can explore the Concept EQ with VR or check out the COMAND Online connectivity and navigation tools in the Mercedes-Benz E Class Coupe. The company is also debuting its “smart ready to share” service, which lets owners share a car with friends or coworkers, and the “smart ready to drop” service, which allows package deliveries right to your trunk.
BMW is expected to expand on its connected car plans later this week. Ford is also at MWC, but it seems to be keeping a lower profile so far. Speakers from Roborace and Formula E will give keynote addresses, and the agenda includes sessions on autonomous vehicles and cars as a service.
Attending MWC 2017 is smart on the part of car companies, given that in Q1 2016, more cars were newly connected to cell service than any other kind of device. Much of the new growth for mobility companies is likely to come from connected vehicles in the next decade.

494,Here’s what the head of Uber’s self-driving program wasn’t asked on stage today,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/27/heres-what-the-head-of-ubers-self-driving-program-wasnt-asked-on-stage-today/,2017/02/27,"
Uber-owned Otto’s co-founder Anthony Levandowski must be mightily relieved after an onstage Q&A here at the Mobile World Congress tradeshow passed by with zero awkward moments.
For example, there was no mention of the fact that Levandowski’s former employer is suing his current employer over allegations of IP theft.
Last week Alphabet claimed to have evidence that Levandowski secretly downloaded thousands of engineering blueprints when he was a manager at Waymo’s self-driving car project. And is alleging he used the stolen proprietary IP — such as Lidar circuit board designs — to set up the startup he subsequently sold to Uber last August.
Otto was only founded at the start of 2016 but was publicly demoing its autonomous truck driving system on the highway by May. By August Uber had acquired the startup — for a reported price-tag of $680M.
Yet Levandowski was asked nada about the allegations.
Instead, as he sat on stage clutching a waterbottle, he was asked by Michael O’Hara, the GSMA’s CMO, how Uber could make people feel “comfortable” about using its autonomous technology — rather than being grilled more directly on safety risks and safety record.
After all, under Levandowski’s stewardship, an Uber self-driving car ran a red light in San Francisco last December.
And while, at the time, the company claimed it was due to “human error”, a New York Times report this week suggests otherwise — with the paper quoting two Uber sources saying it was actually being driven in autonomous mode at the time of the incident.
Levandowski was asked generally about security ‘scare stories’ being linked to connected cars. Earlier today, for instance, Softbank’s CEO warned that ARM chips currently being used in cars are not secure from hacking.
And directly before Levandowski’s session, security veteran Eugene Kaspersky painted a Skynet-esque picture of the cyber risks facing hopelessly insecure critical infrastructure and poorly design IoT devices, calling for a wholesale redesigning of all connected systems with security front of mind.
On these general concerns, Levandowski said Uber’s security approach is to build layers into the self-driving system so that, for example, “you’re not exposing your drive-by-wire system to same set of map IDs you want to stream”.
“Absolutely we want to make sure these cars are safe,” he added, to zero follow up.
Also absent from the interview were any hard questions about whether Uber has overriden regulators’ safety concerns in seeking to accelerate its autonomous tech onto public roads as quickly as possible, and before it’s been tested robustly enough — following the typical Uber playbook that puts rollouts and user growth in the driving seat.
In December, for example, Uber was ordered to stop a pilot of its self-driving Uber service in San Francisco — and initially refused, claiming its test vehicles were not truly autonomous and therefore did not require a permit. City regulators disagreed, however, and Uber was forced off the road in California, but clearly not by choice.
Levandowski confirmed it is currently testing self-driving Ubers in Phoenix and Pittsburgh, where it has 12 cars apiece which ride-hailers might be paired with when they call an Uber X.
He was asked a rather softball question about whether councils and cities are “comfortable” with the tech — and about how Uber deals with “regulatory barriers” standing in the way of its self-driving ambitions.
“Regulation is one thing we think is really important,” he duly replied on this. “We want to make sure we are working with the governments to improve safety and make sure innovation can happen quickly so it doesn’t take 10 years to roll out.”
At this point Levandowski went on to disingenuously suggest that self-driving technology should be able to follow a similar timeline to the rollout of mobile phone tech — warning of the risk of “stifling a tremendous amount of innovation”.
Although clearly phones have never been likely to run the risk of running people down in the street and killing them. An obvious point that passed this interview by without being made.
The most sweat-inducing moment for Levandowski was whether he was asked whether the company’s tech has ever hit anything. “We’ve had other people hit us,” he replied, dodging a more direct answer.
“We take very good care operating safely so have vehicle operators in there,” he added. “The responsibility is still on the vehicle operators behind the wheel. We don’t let the car drive on things that are too challenging.”
Uber’s own current troubles with accusations of systemic sexism also — inexorably — went unmentioned during the interview, and the session ended without the opportunity for an audience Q&A. So perhaps Levandowski needn’t have rushed through his answers quite so quickly.
Move along folks, nothing to see here.

495,Peugeot’s Instinct concept car has active driving and autonomous modes,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/27/peugeots-instinct-concept-car-has-active-driving-and-autonomous-modes/,2017/02/27,"
Some concept cars aren’t really cars and stop at the concept part. But Peugeot’s new Instinct concept car has a couple of interesting ideas. In particular, the interior will change depending on the driving mode (active driving or self-driving). Peugeot unveiled the car at MWC today in Barcelona.
I generally hate concept cars are they are mostly unimplementable designs that won’t ever make their way to a commercial car. But sometimes, just sometimes, there are a few ideas that could be useful in future models.
Peugeot’s concept car is a self-driving car at heart. The wheel and pedals automatically fold, and you can instantly switch from self-driving mode to active driving mode.
But the company is going one step further by implementing four different modes — two active driving modes (Drive Boost or Drive Relax) and two self-driving modes (Autonomous Sharp or Autonomous Soft). Peugeot is using touch screens for the cockpit.
Depending on the mode, the seats are going to change so that you can sit more comfortably if you’re not driving for instance. The light, atmosphere and sound also adapt to the mode. Finally, Autonomous Soft is all about providing a smooth ride so you can take a nap. Autonomous Sharp favors the quickest route.

Also worth noting, Peugeot’s concept car connects to the internet and works with Samsung Artik Cloud. This way, you can communicate with your car from your Samsung Artik Cloud-enabled devices, and the car can adjust its settings depending on your other devices. For instance, if you went running, the car could start with the Autonomous Soft mode pre-selected as you’re probably tired.
Of course you won’t see a car like this on the road any time soon. But if you consider that this concept car is a very expensive brainstorming session, the driving modes are a neat idea that Peugeot should remember in the years to come.

496,Superintelligent AI explains Softbank’s push to raise a $100BN Vision Fund,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/27/superintelligent-ai-explains-softbanks-push-to-raise-a-100bn-vision-fund/,2017/02/27,"
Anyone who’s seen Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son give a keynote speech will know he rarely sticks to the standard industry conference playbook.
And his turn on the stage at Mobile World Congress this morning was no different, with Son making like Eldon Tyrell and telling delegates about his personal belief in a looming computing Singularity that he’s convinced will see superintelligent robots arriving en masse within the next 30 years, surpassing the human population in number and brainpower.
“I totally believe this concept,” he said, of the Singularity. “In next 30 years this will become a reality.”
“If superintelligence goes inside the moving device then the world, our lifestyle dramatically changes,” he continued, pointing out that autonomous vehicles containing a superintelligent AI would become smart robots.
“There will be many kinds. Flying, swimming, big, micro, run, two legs, four legs, 100 legs,” he added, further fleshing out his vision of a robot-infested future.
Son said his personal conviction in the looming rise of billions of superintelligent robots both explains his acquisition of UK chipmaker ARM last year, and his subsequent plan to establish the world’s biggest VC fund.
“I truly believe it’s coming, that’s why I’m in a hurry – to aggregate the cash, to invest,” he noted.
Son’s intent to raise $100BN for a new fund, called the Softbank Vision Fund, was announced last October, getting early backing from Saudi Arabia’s public investment fund as one of the partners.
The fund has since pulled in additional contributors including Foxconn, Apple, Qualcomm and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison’s family office.
But it has evidently not yet hit Son’s target of $100BN as he used his MWC keynote as a sales pitch for additional partners. “I’m looking for a partner because we alone cannot do it,” he told delegates, smiling and opening his arms in a wide gesture of appeal. “We have to do it quickly and here are all kinds of candidates for my partner.”
Son said his haste is partly down to a belief that superintelligent AIs can be used for “the goodness of humanity”, going on to suggest that only AI has the potential to address some of the greatest threats to humankind’s continued existence — be it climate change or nuclear annihilation.
Though he also said it’s important to consider whether such a technology will be “good or bad”.
“It will be so much more capable than us –- what will be our job? What will be our life? We have to ask philosophical questions,” he said. “Is it good or bad?”
“I think this superintelligence is going to be our partner. If we misuse it it’s a risk. If we use it in good spirits it will be our partner for a better life. So the future can be better predicted, people will live healthier, and so on,” he added.
Given this vision for billions of superintelligence connected devices fast-coming down the pipe, Son is unsurprisingly very concerned about security. He said he discusses this weekly with ARM engineers. And described how one of his engineers had played a game to see how many security cameras he could hack during a lunchtime while waiting for his wife. The result? 1.2M cameras potentially compromised during an idle half hour or so.
“This is how it is dangerous, this is how we should start thinking of protection of ourself,” said Son. “We have to be very very careful.
“We are shipping a lot of ARM chips but in the past those were not secure. We are enhancing very quickly the security. We need to secure all of the things in our society.”
Son also risked something of a Gerald Ratner moment when he said that all the chips ARM is currently shipping for use in connected cars are not , in fact, secure. Going so far as to show a video of a connected car being hacked and the driver being unable to control the brakes or steering.
“There are 500 ARM chips [in one car] today — and none of them are secure today btw!” said Son. (Though clearly he’s working hard with his team at ARM to change that.)
He also discussed a plan to launch 800 satellites in the next three years, positioned in a nearer Earth orbit to reduce latency and support faster connectivity, as part of a plan to help plug connectivity gaps for connected cars — describing the planned configuration of satellites as “like a cell tower” and like “fiber coming straight to the Earth from space”.
“We’re going to provide connectivity to billions of drivers from the satellites,” he said.
For carriers hungry for their next billions of subscribers as smartphone markets saturate across the world, Son painted a pictured of vast subscriber growth via the proliferation of connected objects — which handily of course also helps his bottom line, as the new parent of ARM.
“If I say number of subscribers will not grow it’s not true,” he told the conference. “Smartphones no — but IoT chips will grow to a trillion chips — so we will have 1TR subscribers in the next 20 years. And they will all be smart.”
“One of the chips in our shoes in the next 30 years will be smart than our brain. We will be less than our shoes! And we are stepping on them!” he joked. “It’s an interesting society that comes.
“All of the cities, social ecosystem infrastructure will be connected,” he added. “All those things will be connected. All connected securely and managed from the cloud.”

497,Elon Musk addresses working condition claims in Tesla staff-wide email,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/24/elon-musk-addresses-working-condition-claims-in-tesla-staff-wide-email/,2017/02/24,"
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has shared the results of his own investigation into factory working conditions at the carmaker, following accusations by employee and union advocate Jose Moran made in a Medium post earlier this month.
Musk’s lengthy email was sent to all Tesla employees, and addresses all areas of concern raised by Moran, including safety, compensation and work hours. The Tesla CEO said claims about improper safety controls are unfounded, based on investigation of both Moran’s specific team and the factory in general. In fact, Musk says the company’s accident rate is less than half that of the larger auto industry on average.
Musk also charts compensation, factoring in equity-based compensation and benefits to display a considerable pay advantage vs. the big three automakers. Of course, that depends on stock remaining stable or improving through vesting periods. Regarding work hours, Musk said that the company has dropped overtime hours by 50 percent since last year and hopes to continue to improve those numbers through Model 3 production.
Curiously, Musk also concludes with a section on “Fun,” in which he discusses non-tangible employee benefits on the road map like frozen yogurt stands distributed throughout the factory, and an electric roller coaster intended to help employees get around the Fremont campus in a unique way – including an “optional” loop the loop.
The full email, obtained by TechCrunch, is included below:

For Tesla to become and remain one of the great companies of the 21st century, we must have an environment that is as safe, fair and fun as possible. It is incredibly important to me that you look forward to coming to work every day. For that, we must be a fair and just company – the only kind worth creating.
This is vital to succeed in our mission to accelerate the advent of a clean, sustainable energy future. The forces arrayed against us are many and incredibly powerful. This is David vs Goliath if David were six inches tall! Only by being smarter, faster and working well as a tightly integrated team do we have any chance of success. We should never forget the history of car startups originating in the United States: dozens have gone bankrupt and only two, Tesla and Ford, have not. Despite the odds being strongly against us, my faith in you is why I am confident that we will succeed.
That is why I was so distraught when I read the recent blog post promoting the UAW, which does not share our mission and whose true allegiance is to the giant car companies, where the money they take from employees in dues is vastly more than they could ever make from Tesla.
The tactics they have resorted to are disingenuous or outright false. I will address their underhanded attacks below. While this discussion focuses on Fremont, these same principles apply to every Tesla facility worldwide.
Safety First
The workplace issue that comes before any other is safety. If you do not have your health, then nothing else matters. Simply due to size and bad luck, there will always be some injuries in a company with over 30,000 employees, but our goal is simple: to have as close to zero injuries as possible and be the safest factory in the auto industry by far. The Tesla executive team and I are absolutely committed to this goal.
That is why I was particularly troubled by the safety claim in last week’s blog post, which said: “A few months ago, six out of eight people in my work team were out on medical leave at the same time due to various work-related injuries. I hear the ergonomics are even more severe in other areas of the factory.”
Obviously, this cannot be true: if three quarters of his team suddenly went on medical leave, we would not be able to operate that part of the factory. Furthermore, if things were really even worse in other departments, that would mean something like 80% or more of the factory would be out on injury, production would drop to virtually nothing and the parking lot would be almost empty. As you know firsthand, we have the *opposite* problem – there is never enough room to park! In fact, we are working at top speed to build more parking. Also, hopefully our darn BART train station will open before all hell freezes over!
After looking into this claim, not only was it untrue for this individual’s team, it was untrue for any of the hundreds of teams in the factory.
That said, reducing excess overtime and improving safety are extremely important. This is why we hired thousands of additional team members to create a third shift, which has reduced the burden on everyone. Moreover, since the beginning of Tesla production at Fremont five years ago, there have been dedicated health and safety experts covering the factory and we hold regular safety meetings with operations leaders. Since the majority of the injuries in the factory are ergonomic in nature, we have an ergonomics department focused exclusively on this issue.
The net result is that since January 1st, our total recordable incident rate (TRIR) is under 3.3, which is less than half the industry average of 6.7.
Of course, the goal is to have as close to zero injuries as humanly possible, so we need to keep improving. If you have a safety concern or an idea on how to make things better, please let your manager, safety representative or HR partner know. You can also send an anonymous note through the Integrity Hotline (this applies broadly to any problems you notice at our company) or you can email safety@tesla.com.
Compensation
At Tesla, we believe it is important for everyone to be an owner of the company. This is your company. That is why, unlike other car companies, everyone is awarded shares and you get to buy stock at a discount compared to the public through the employee stock purchase program. Last year, stock equity grants were increased significantly and it will happen again later this year once Model 3 achieves high volume.
The chart below contrasts the total comp received by a Tesla production team member who started on January 1, 2013 against the total comp received over the same period at GM, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler. A four year period is used because that’s the vesting length of a new hire equity grant. I believe the equity gain over the next four years will be similar. As shown below, a Tesla team member earned between $70,000 and $100,000 more in total compensation than the employees at other US auto companies!

Work Hours
Another issue raised in the UAW blog was hours worked. First, I want to recognize how hard you worked to make our company successful. Those hours mattered to you, to your family and to our company, and I can’t tell you how much I appreciate them.
However, the pace needs to be sustainable. This is why the third shift was established and why we created alternate work schedules based on feedback from various teams in the factory.
These changes have had a big impact. The average amount of hours worked by production team members this year is about 43 hours per week. The percentage of overtime hours has declined by almost 50% since the super tough time we had last year achieving rate on the Model X, which is probably the hardest car to build in history. What an amazing accomplishment! It is also a lesson learned, which is why Model 3 is designed to be dramatically easier to manufacture.
Fun
As we get closer to being a profitable company, we will be able to afford more and more fun things. For example, as I mentioned at the last company talk, we are going to hold a really amazing party once Model 3 reaches volume production later this year. There will also be little things that come along like free frozen yogurt stands scattered around the factory and my personal favorite: a Tesla electric pod car roller coaster (with an optional loop the loop route, of course!) that will allow fast and fun travel throughout our Fremont campus, dipping in and out of the factory and connecting all the parking lots. It’s going to get crazy good 🙂
Thanks again for all your effort and I look forward to working alongside you to create an amazing future!
Elon

498,Volkswagen’s e-Golf gets a range boost to 125 miles for 2017,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/24/volkswagens-e-golf-gets-a-range-boost-to-125-miles-for-2017/,2017/02/24,"
The e-Golf, Volkswagen’s electric version of its popular compact car, officially gets around 50 percent more range this year than it did in the previous model. That means it now has an EPA rating of 125 miles on a single charge (via Autoblog), compared to 83 miles before. The 125-mile range is still a far cry from the Chevy Bolt’s industry-leading EV range, but the e-Golf is not a vehicle designed for purely electric drivetrains, and it’s also a big enough boost that you can add a few more errands to your daily chore list.
The VW boost is similar to other range additions made by EV makers who are looking to get the most out of advancements in battery tech without completely going back to the drawing board to revamp their car designs. It may not seem like much, but breaking that 100-mile barrier is likely a good way to convince a new category of buyer that they can indeed manage all the driving they need to do on a regular basis without having to stop mid-day to recharge.
Range anxiety is real, and a boost of around 40 miles should actually open up a whole new group of potential customers, alongside other factors that could help drive more EV sales, like increasing familiarity and comfort with the technology among average car buyers.

499,Embark’s self-driving truck is ready to assist human drivers,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/24/embarks-self-driving-truck-is-ready-to-assist-human-drivers/,2017/02/24,"

Self-driving trucking startup Embark is revealing its tech for the first time, showing off a competitor for Uber’s Otto that uses neural networks and deep learning to teach trucks how to drive themselves through their own processes of practice and trial and error.
Embark’s trucks are also approved to test on Nevada roads, hence the desert scenery you see in the video above, and in the images included in this post. The company’s tech is able to handle potential obstacles like a slow car occupying the lane in front, and pass on undivided highways, as you can see in the video. It can also handle glare, fog and darkness, having learned to do so on its own, according to Embark co-founder and CEO Alex Rodrigues.
The tech Embark has created is not designed to replace human drivers entirely, at least for now. Instead, it’s intended to take over control during long stretches of relatively boring and straightforward driving, while also passing control to human drivers when it enters complex driving scenarios like those found in cities.
The company’s foundation was based on the fact that there’s currently a truck drive shortage, and its tech can help add to the number of routes a human driver can handle by decreasing their actual time spent actively driving. Even though driving is, across categories, a huge employment category in the U.S., it’s also true that most overland freight providers are also looking to add to their cadre of capable drivers.
Rodrigues’ team at Embark includes SpaceX alumni, as well as people from Audi’s self-driving team. The startup also has funding from Maven Ventures, which also backed Cruise, the self-driving company GM acquired for $1 billion to help kickstart its own autonomous vehicle development efforts.
There’s no definite timeline on Embark’s deployment of its self-driving truck in active service, but the company is ramping its engineering hiring aggressively and hopes also to build out its fleet of testing vehicles for its Nevada trials. And with Uber’s Otto facing strong legal challenges from Alphabet’s Waymo, now might be exactly the right time for a new autonomous trucking startup to strike.

500,Waymo sues Uber and Otto for theft of trade secrets,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/23/waymo-sues-uber-and-otto-for-theft-of-trade-secrets/,2017/02/23,"
Waymo, the Alphabet-owned self-driving company that began life as Google’s self-driving car project, has filed suit against self-driving trucking company Otto, and its parent company, Uber. Waymo says that Uber “misappropriated” its trade secrets, and infringed upon its held patents. Specifically, Waymo says it has found evidence that Otto and Uber have been using elements of its self-driving tech related to its custom, in-house LiDAR sensors, which the company unveiled earlier this year.
In its complaint, Waymo says that it developed a “combination of unique laser systems to provide critical information for the operation of fully self-driving vehicles,” which were taken by Otto founder Anthony Levandowski specifically, who was previously a manager working for Waymo. Levandowski downloaded more than 14,000 “highly confidential and proprietary files” from Waymo prior to leaving the company, including its proprietary LiDAR circuit board design. Amazingly, Waymo says it discovered this chain of events initially when a supplier accidentally copied it on emails to Uber and Otto that contained a circuit board design from the ride-sharing company which looked remarkably like its own.
Waymo says this theft took place in December 2015, just prior to when Levandowski left and started his own company, which would become Otto in January 2016. The complaint says Levandowski was already setting up his venture prior to leaving the Alphabet-owned operation.
The complaint makes even more allegations, accusing other former Waymo employees who left to join what would become Otto of downloading more of its trade secrets, including supplier lists and technical documents.
The Waymo suit cites Biz Carson reporting for Business Insider that Otto’s in-house development of its own LiDAR tech was key to its acquisition by Uber, and the suit also says that Levandowski and Otto gained more than half-a-billion dollars directly via the theft, and that Uber also resuscitated its own stalled efforts to compete with Waymo based on the planned abuses.
Obviously this is a huge setback for Uber, at a time when it’s also facing a lot of internal and external trouble related to alleged sexual harassment experienced by a former employee and made public earlier this week.
We’ve reached out to Uber for comment, and will update if they respond.

501,Elon Musk says he doesn’t think Tesla unionization is “likely to occur”,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/22/elon-musk-says-he-doesnt-think-tesla-unionization-is-likely-to-occur/,2017/02/22,"
Tesla CEO Elon Musk addressed on the company’s earnings call on Wednesday alleged efforts on behalf of employees at its Fremont factory to unionize. Musk said he’s going to publish in his own blog post the results of his own investigation into conditions at the factory and employee attitudes toward unionization, but he shared some initial thoughts about his findings.
Musk said he found Tesla’s factory actually half the accident risk when compared to the rest of the automotive industry. He also said that Tesla employees are the highest paid in the industry, when you factor in equity compensation on top of more direct earned revenue.
He added that he believes “there are really only disadvantages to saying that someone wants the UAW here,” and reiterated his belief that the author of a Medium post detailing Tesla factory conditions and the desire on the part of employees to unionize is actually a de facto UAW employee. Musk said that the “track record is worse at every other company,” and included that in his estimation at least, it’s not likely that Tesla’s production workers will end up unionizing.

502,"Tesla wants to offer vehicles with one price, including insurance and maintenance",https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/22/tesla-wants-to-offer-vehicles-with-one-price-including-insurance-and-maintenance/,2017/02/22,"
Tesla has begun offering customers in Asia a package that includes in the purchase price the cost of insurance and maintenance, the company noted on its earnings call today. This is how they’d like to offer vehicles across their markets in the future, the carmaker says, and it’ll do so in partnership with external insurance providers — but it has also looked at handling insurance in-house as an option, too.
“We’re actually currently doing that,” Jeff Evanson, Tesla VP of Global Investor Relations explained on the call. “We’ve been doing it quietly, but in Asia in particular where we started this, now the majority of Tesla cars are sold with an insurance product that is customized to Tesla, that takes into account not only the Autopilot safety features but also the maintenance costs of the car. It’s our vision in the future that we’ll be able to offer a single price for the car, maintenance and insurance in a really compelling offering for the consumer. And we’re currently doing that today.”
“This is not to the exclusion of insurance providers if we find that insurance providers are not matching the insurance proportionate to the risk of the car,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk added. “If we need to we’ll insource it, but I think we’ll find that insurance partners do adjust rates proportionate to the risk of a Tesla.”
The company does this in part because they believe their vehicles offer strong advantages in terms of safety record and maintenance costs over the life of the vehicle. It would definitely offer more transparency at checkout versus other options, and it sounds like a laudable pursuit overall for car buyers.

Elon Musk sounded upbeat and jocular about the news on the call, and he also noted, as did Wheeler, that Wheeler would be heading to a role in the public sector from his position at Tesla.
Ahuja retired from Tesla in 2015 following the hiring of his replacement, Wheeler. He was a crucial part of Tesla’s process of going pubic, which the company did in 2010.

504,Self-driving Ubers are now picking people up in Arizona,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/21/self-driving-ubers-are-now-picking-people-up-in-arizona/,2017/02/21,"
Uber pinned hopes on running its self-driving fleet in San Francisco but motored off to Arizona two months ago when that plan ran up against some local red tape. Now, just as Uber is dealing with an explosive report of sexual harassment within its engineering team, the company has officially rolled out its self-driving cars in the Grand Canyon state.
Starting today, those in Tempe, Arizona can order up one of Uber’s self-driving Volvo XC90 SUV’s on the platform.
Uber rolled out its pilot self-driving car program first in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and then in San Francisco mid-December with 16 self-driving vehicles but ran into issues with the state of California when the California DMV insisted Uber cars needed to get a $150 self-driving car permit before driving on California roads. Uber refused, then one of the self-driving cars ran a red light, drama ensued. One week later, off to Arizona the Volvos went.
The Arizona program has firm support from state Governor Doug Ducey, who’s been a proponent of the plan since the day these automated vehicles showed up, telling Uber the state welcomed the companies self-driving fleet, “with open arms and wide open roads.”
But it’s not the first time Arizona has taken a much more liberal stance on driving tech. Governor Ducey also signed an executive order in August 2015 allowing for the testing and operating of self-driving vehicles in the state — which is partly why GM’s automated platform Cruise chose to open up its second manufacturing facility in Phoenix and why Scottsdale, Arizona has become a hotbed of driverless car testing.

The Governor is now rider number one for Uber’s self-driving program, but he won’t be all alone in the vehicle. Though the state has much friendlier regulatory guidelines for self-driving cars than California, Uber will still have two driver engineers to help operate each car, according to The Verge, which first reported the launch.
No word yet from Uber, or Governor Ducey’s office about the rollout but it seems oddly timed with the current drama. Following the aforementioned report of sexual harassment at Uber over the weekend, CEO Travis Kalanick hosted an all-hands meeting today, along with board member Arianna Huffington and Chief Human Resources Officer Liane Hornsey, to discuss the company’s next steps.
While the rollout seems a positive step in the company’s future direction it may not be enough to pull it out of an increasingly bad reputation. Just weeks before the recent allegations of widespread sexism Kalanick stepped down from Trump’s tech advisory board after a reported 200,000 people deleted their accounts during a #DeleteUber campaign.
We are waiting to hear back on what was said in today’s all-hands meeting at the moment but this meeting comes after TechCrunch obtained an internal memo from Kalanick yesterday, which further explained the details of the independent investigation Uber plans to conduct around the sexual harassment allegations. He also notified employees that the company has brought on former US Attorney General Eric Holder, as well as Tammy Albarran of law firm Covington & Burling to lead the investigation.

The Tampa-Hillsborough Expressway Authority (THEA) has partnered with Savari and Brandmotion to create a vehicle-to-everything infrastructure pilot program to help ease commuting and make it safer for everyone — including pedestrians.
The program will equip 1,500 cars, 10 buses, and 10 trolleys with Savari’s On-Board Units, or OBUs. That’s the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) piece. In addition, 500 pedestrians will have an app on their phones that enables vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) communications and warnings. And there will be roadside units at 40 intersections for the pilot program providing vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. All of these pieces will use dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) to transmit basic information about things like location and speed.
Brandmotion’s part in the program is to integrate all this information with vehicle ADAS systems. So when a vehicle detects a pedestrian stepping into a crosswalk via V2P communications, the message is made meaningful when the automatic emergency braking system (AEB) stops the car. (Have you had enough of acronyms yet?)
Tampa is an interesting place for this pilot program as it has reversible express lanes that can flow either way, depending on the direction of heavy traffic. One of the goals is to use V2X technology to prevent wrong-way entries on the freeway. THEA also hopes to improve traffic light timing, relieve congestion during the morning commute, and make intersections less confusing when there’s a trolley, buses, and pedestrians trying to figure out when it’s safe to proceed.
Savari says in trials conducted by the Department of Transportation (where Savari provided much of the connected car technology), V2V technology alone was predicted to prevent 80 percent of traffic accidents.

506,BMW and Mobileye to crowdsource real-time data for self-driving from 2018,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/21/bmw-and-mobileye-to-crowdsource-real-time-data-for-self-driving-from-2018/,2017/02/21,"
BMW and Mobileye are working together, with the automaker employing Mobileye’s Road Experience Management (REM) software in its vehicles from 2018 onward. The tech, which Mobileye also recently announced would be coming to future Volkswagen cars, helps crowdsource real-time road data captures by the advanced driver assist hardware on vehicles, which will eventually help provide a key ingredient for fully autonomous driving.
The REM system developed by Mobileye can provide information like road hazards, traffic delays, weather information and even parking availability from individual vehicles, which it will pool in the cloud, and then make available to enter fleets, giving them a way to supplement pre-existing static HD maps with to-the-minute info from real-world driving. That kind of data will likely be crucial to autonomous vehicle systems, especially early on, as it’s very challenging to build learning systems that can deal with all aspects of shifting road conditions on the fly.
Mobileye’s goal is to source data from a range of different vehicle manufacturers, in order to more quickly and accurately build anonymized real-time mapping data that can serve to inform autonomous driving systems more generally, which should in theory lead to safer roads. The partnership with BMW will collect data that it then passes on to HERE, which will use the real-time info to provide instant updates to its HD Live Map, a cloud mapping service the company is making available for semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicles.
Basically, the more automakers Mobileye has on REM, the more useful and appealing to other automakers it becomes. Ultimately shared components between the disparate self-driving systems of various car manufacturers should help serve the overall efficacy and safety of the whole, since a system that can learn from larger and more comprehensive data sets is almost certainly bound to be better than one that has only a single piece of the puzzle.
BMW is already working with HERE, as long with Intel and Mobileye on delivering highly automated vehicles to the road for a target 2021 timeframe, so this should help pave the way for that, with ample data connected in advance from the next few years’ worth of shipping vehicles.

507,Tech War: Prius Prime vs. Hyundai Ioniq,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/20/tech-war-prius-prime-vs-hyundai-ioniq/,2017/02/20,"
By a lucky coincidence, I had a chance to drive both the 2017 Prius Prime and the 2017 Hyundai Ioniq in the same week. The Prius Prime is a plug-in hybrid with a futuristic vibe; the Hyundai Ioniq comes in hybrid, plug-in hybrid and electric versions.
The Prius lineup and the Ioniq lineup are competing for the same buyers, so there will be plenty of comparisons in the automotive press. But this is TechCrunch, so let’s take a look at the technology in each.
Instrument cluster
The first thing anyone is going to look at as soon as they slide into the driver’s seat is the dashboard. The Hyundai Ioniq puts everything where you expect it to be, with a TFT LCD cluster right in front of you. Controls on the steering wheel allow you to choose which information (besides the basics like speed and fuel level) is displayed.
If you’ve never been in a Prius, you might be surprised to have to look a bit to the right to see your instrument cluster. It’s in the center of the dashboard under a curved plastic cowl. There’s loads of information over there, and you can select what’s displayed. It looks, cool but requires you to glance sideways while you’re driving. The Prius Prime I tested had a heads-up display that I found very useful for just this reason.
Infotainment
The Ioniq hybrid I test drove had a clean, basic center console with an 8-inch touch screen with navigation included as part of the Ultimate package. Standard equipment included Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, plus Hyundai’s Blue Link telematics system. (I also drove the EV version, which had a nearly identical infotainment system.)
The Prime Advanced that I tested, which is the top of the Prime line, had a massive 11.6-inch display, but no integration for Apple or Android phones. It was compatible with Siri Eyes-Free and had Toyota’s Entune App Suite, which includes Pandora, iHeartRadio, OpenTable, traffic and weather.
Safety
The Prius Prime comes with Toyota Safety Sense, which is standard on most of its new cars. It includes pedestrian detection, lane departure alert with steering assist and radar cruise control. These aren’t standard features for the Ioniq, but the Ultimate package I tested did have similar safety tech. Both vehicles come with a rear-view camera, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alerts.
Connectivity
The Prius Prime Advanced adds Prime Apps that can be used to manage your charging status from your phone, find a charging station, warm or cool the interior while it’s still plugged in to preserve range and find your vehicle when you’ve forgotten where you parked it.
Hyundai takes that further by connecting the Ioniq to everything it can. Blue Link does all that Prime Apps do, plus integrates with Amazon Alexa (and soon Google Assistant), Apple Watch and Android Wear watches. And it has roadside assistance and stolen vehicle recovery.
Which vehicle has the best tech depends on what you want your vehicle to do. If the idea of Alexa monitoring your every move gives you the creeps, maybe the super-connected Ioniq is too much. But if you have to have Android Auto, the Prius Prime won’t have it. If you like quirky, the Prius Prime exudes quirky. If you want a low-key commuter car, the Ioniq blends in on the highway.
And if you absolutely must have wireless charging for your phone, your decision just got harder. Both the Prius Prime and the Hyundai Ioniq have it available.

Autonomous vehicles were one of the most talked about technologies in 2016. Ever since Tesla, Google and Uber put these vehicles on the consumer trend map — as well as beer deliveries — I’ve been daydreaming of the day I might own one myself. Unfortunately for me, and the automotive industry, that day might not be coming too soon.
Wired reporter Andy Greenberg chronicled his “real-life” experience driving a hijacked Jeep Cherokee. Andy agreed to be the guinea pig for two St. Louis-based researchers, whom he refers to as “hijackers.” While Andy drove the vehicle, the two hijackers experimented with just how far they could hack into the vehicle’s computerized system. What started as a hijacking of the vehicle’s air conditioning and music ended with a disabled accelerator and a powerless driver.
Andy’s exposé highlighted just how easy it can be for a seasoned professional to hack into a car, and it drew national attention among consumers and law makers. Last year the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) released guidelines stating that automakers should make cybersecurity a priority. While most would agree that the NHTSA is correct in its guidance, there is one major problem: cybersecurity is a never-ending battle. Individuals with enough technical skills, patience and desire to profit will find a way around the latest security barriers.
What’s critical in the new world of constantly connected devices, particularly autonomous vehicles, is that we must take a holistic view of cybersecurity that goes beyond more complex encryption.
The vulnerability of connected devices
Assuming that the cybersecurity issues can be resolved in the next few years, autonomous vehicles will become one of the leading contributors to the Internet of Things (IoT). Similar to other IoT devices, like mobile phones and wearable fitness trackers, autonomous vehicles will also generate consumer data that will influence the way businesses, government and other policy makers operate. But like most connected devices in the IoT, the software infrastructures and data generated from autonomous vehicles will also become more exposed to risks.
In fact, Munich Re, the world’s second-largest reinsurer, found that 55 percent of corporate risk managers surveyed in a recent study named cybersecurity as their top concern for autonomous vehicles. Even more alarming, 64 percent of companies surveyed say they feel completely unprepared to address cybersecurity.
Solutions and insights generated from location-based data has moved beyond the nice-to-have.
Hackers thrive on vulnerabilities, and they’re already starting to take advantage of unprotected autonomous vehicles. In August of last year, hackers were arrested for stealing more than 100 cars in Texas simply by using a computer to unlock and start the vehicles.
Automakers have poured billions of dollars into developing autonomous vehicles, but if they can’t keep the cars and their drivers safe, I’ll never have one of these vehicles sitting in my garage. While the NHTSA may not have all the answers to addressing cybersecurity threats, automakers may be able to look under the hood of their own vehicles to find a potential solution.
Re-imagining GPS
Devices in the IoT are unique in that they generate a wealth of data, including location-based data. So whether it’s your phone, your mobile device or your car, consumers that opt-in for location-based services allow these devices to capture both their movements and what they’re doing at each point along their journey.
Autonomous vehicles are utilizing and capturing location-based data, which can be analyzed to identify behaviors like vehicle movement, speed, average drive times or even proximity to other objects, like other vehicles and retail stores, which in return can benefit the consumer.
Location-based data offers consumers and businesses the potential to reveal a great deal of information. Retailers are already leveraging data generated by cars to inform their site selection decisions, and the public sector is using the data for civic improvement and planning projects.
Consumers are also benefiting from the data by being able to route their cars to avoid traffic jams, or reduce their insurance deductibles for their good driving behavior. But the most notable perk from location-based data may also be used to uncover abnormalities in behaviors, which could be used to detect and limit actions taken by hackers.
For example, when a hazard symbol flashes on your dashboard, the data your car generates is telling the system that there is a problem — maybe your tire pressure is low, you need an oil change or there’s a door that has not been completely closed. Your vehicle knows how it should operate; if the data suggests it’s not running as it should, you’re immediately alerted with the hazard light.

Theoretically, the same type of real-time alert infrastructure could help resolve cybersecurity threats and more traditional thefts, which could lead to new or expanded offerings by vehicle monitoring companies like OnStar, UConnect, Blue Link, Ford Synch, etc. If drivers allow these organizations or safety officials to monitor their vehicle’s location and have a complete view of typical driving behaviors, officials can be alerted immediately to any behaviors that may stray from expectations — and shut down the vehicle in an emergency situation.
So if an autonomous vehicle is speeding through a residential neighborhood, creeping to a halt on a major interstate or not slowing down as it approaches a red light, officials may be able to override the computerized system, and a potential hacker, to restore the vehicle to a safe-driving state. Alternately, if it is determined that the vehicle is being driven without authorization, the same systems can be used to potentially keep the driver trapped until law enforcement arrive.
By leveraging the existing infrastructures that are in place, automakers can potentially turn up a notch their location-based infrastructure and internal diagnostics — while potentially addressing the cybersecurity and vehicle theft problems.

The future of driverless vehicles
No one has the answer to solving this potentially multi-billion dollar crisis automakers are facing, but I believe an answer might be uncovered by leveraging the location-based infrastructure that is already in place. We live in a world where technology is growing at rapid speeds, and most companies don’t have the time or money to reinvent the wheel every time something new is introduced in the market.
Automakers already have the infrastructure in place for capturing and using location-based data, and they’ve been able to monetize those capabilities with industries that benefit from that data. But the same could apply for the safety of their customers.
Solutions and insights generated from location-based data has moved beyond the nice-to-have — it’s a need-to-have to keep drivers safe when they’re behind the wheel of an autonomous vehicle.

509,Ford invests $1 billion in Pittsburgh-based Argo AI to build self-driving cars by 2021,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/18/ford-invests-in-pittsburgh-based-argo-ai-to-build-self-driving-cars-by-2021/,2017/02/18,"
Ford has invested $1 billion in a joint venture with Argo AI, a Pittsburgh-based company with ties to Carnegie Mellon. The goal is to completely outfit Ford vehicles with self-driving technology. Interestingly, this isn’t a case of a large company simply hiring talent but the creation of an entirely separate company with an independent equity structure.
Ford is the “majority stakeholder,” but will operate with “substantial independence.” Employees will receive equity in the company. The investment will be made over five years.
“AI makers know you basically need an automaker to make an auto,” said a person familiar with the deal commenting on Ford’s decision to connect with the company.
“Argo AI will develop and deploy the latest advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning and computer vision to help build safe and efficient self-driving vehicles that enable these transformations and more,” wrote CEO Bryan Salesky. “The challenges are significant, but we are a team that believes in tackling hard, meaningful problems to improve the world. Our ambitions can only be realized if we are willing to partner with others and keep an open mind about how to solve problems.”
Salesky worked at the Carnegie Mellon University National Robotics Engineering Center and, in 2011, led self-driving hardware at Google.
Other team leaders include Dr. Brett Browning and Dr. Peter Rander. Both left CMU for Uber and recently made the switch to Argo. The company is targeting “full autonomy” by 2021. The two are part of the slow exodus of researchers from Uber two years after that company hired robotics faculty away from CMU.
Ford’s billion dollar investment in a company two months old is, arguably, quite bold. Sources say that the team in place has extensive experience in building autonomous vehicles for Caterpillar and others and it seems this is the best — and fastest — way for Ford to access self-driving talent.

510,GM said to be fielding thousands of self-driving test Bolts with Lyft in 2018,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/17/gm-said-to-be-fielding-thousands-of-self-driving-test-bolts-with-lyft-in-2018/,2017/02/17,"
Self-driving fleets of cars might be sharing the streets with human drivers sooner than many thought; Reuters reports that GM will field “thousands” of self-driving electric test vehicles, primarily based on the Chevrolet Bolt platform, starting in 2018. The fleets will primarily be used with partner Lyft for on-demand ride-hailing service, according to the report.
That’s a lot sooner than the proposed 2020 date Ford and others have been targeting for large-scale deployment of autonomous vehicle fleets in similar ride-sharing functions. The report does call this specifically a launch of “test fleets,” so these vehicles will still likely not be positioned as a commercial debut of a service, but it sounds like we could still see them in active service with customers, since Lyft is said to be planning to operate them in a test capacity in multiple states among its ride-sharing service fleet.
GM has said previously, and reiterated when contacted by Reuters, that it intends to start piloting its autonomous vehicle tech in ride-sharing services “sooner than you might think.” The company has also been sharing regular updates from GM-owned Cruise, which is actively testing autonomous Bolt EVs driving city streets in San Francisco, as well as in Arizona, with plans to expand to Michigan roads soon.
In the course of testing its Cruise fleet, GM has made use of a smartphone app that allows a user to choose a beginning and end point for the trip, and it’s very likely we’ll see similar technology used in any consumer-facing trials at a larger scale. GM and Lyft also previously discussed (in May 2016) plans to begin testing self-driving taxi service on public roads “within a year.”
Lyft rival Uber also recently announced that Daimler would be the first automaker joining its so-called SDV, or self-driving vehicle platform, which is open to all OEMs and will allow them to operate fleets of their own autonomous cars on Uber’s network for ride-hailing services. The tie-up between Lyft and GM has seemed a more exclusive arrangement, and it looks likely to remain that way at least through this test period, if this report is accurate.

Mobileye’s long-game is focused on autonomous driving, but some of the tech that feeds into that can have an impact now, including advanced collision avoidance systems. The company announced on Friday that it has completed the installation of accident prevention tech across 4,500 for-hire vehicles used by drivers for services including Uber and Lyft in New York City, as part of a partnership with transportation insurance provider Atlas Financial Holdings.
The system includes a “high resolution vision sensor,” which, combined with onboard computing, will analyze the road for potential dangers in real time, offering alerts to drivers that are designed to help them avoid accidents before they happen. It’s a mixed bag for drivers, however, because it’s also bringing in Pointer Telocation tech that allows fleet and vehicle owners to keep a closer watch on driver behavior in instances where accidents do occur.
Still, that’s always going to be the flip side of connected vehicles that seek to offer more in the way of driver assistance and warning features: Fewer excuses. It’ll be interesting to see what kind of results arise from the installation of this tech in terms of the number of accidents that involve for-hire vehicles in, say, a year’s time.

512,TesLab is the companion app Tesla owners have been waiting for,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/17/teslab-is-the-companion-app-tesla-owners-have-been-waiting-for/,2017/02/17,"
Tesla actually makes a lot of data available to vehicle owners via APIs and other endpoints, but it’s not always easy to find and make use of that info. Enter TesLab, a new app that tracks data and links it to your profile, while also letting you share it out to a community of other Tesla owners in a way that, during the beta spotted by Teslarati, users have really enjoyed.
The app doesn’t require much on the user’s end. Basically you install it on your mobile device, connect your car and create an account (Facebook and Twitter login required for now, though that’s changing soon with original account creation directly in the app). It then monitors your trips, looking at factors including average speed, starts and stops, braking and more. Based on that info, it’ll tell you your overall efficiency (as a percentage of the total ideal mileage rating for the vehicle).
You can see this info as a color-coded heat map on a literal map, showing you where exactly you dipped below max efficiency and where you performed best. The app displays a total efficiency percentage for the trip, too, as well as total time driving, actual miles driven versus charge depleted as represented in miles and the average temperature — along with that most celebrated of EV stats, gas money saved.
“We both drive Teslas and we’re both really passionate about alternative energy, let’s dig into the technology behind Tesla and let’s see how far they’ll let us go, not being employed by Tesla,” said TesLab co-creator and HappyFunCorp co-founder Ben Schippers in an interview, explaining how he and partner Will Schenk came up with the app. “We also saw an opportunity because you buy this really nice car, and then you have this app and the car is super connected, but the app is not super exciting.”
“We thought, what if we could build a framework for what the connected car could be,” Schippers continues. “What if Tesla gave us enough access to our individual cars that we could build a community around what we envision the connected car of the future could be, across all connected cars?”
TesLab is the result of that experiment, and it does pull a lot of data from your vehicle, and attempts to answer that infinitely debated question among EV owners: How much range am I actually getting, as compared to the EPA rating, and why am I seeing the range I’m seeing? It can even provide data on a phenomenon known in the community as “phantom drain,” which is how much range your vehicle loses just from sitting idle between charges, which is hugely dependent on outdoor temp, among other factors.
Schippers and Schenk made a bet that Tesla owners would be willing to share a lot of information regarding their trips and their vehicles, including specific location data, in exchange for that kind of return info and an active community. It’s essentially the same bet Mark Zuckerberg made with Facebook early on, Schippers tells me, but in the specific realm of Tesla owners instead. But the idea isn’t to keep it limited to the exclusive Tesla driver club forever.
“We believe Chevy, and Ford, and BMW and all the big car manufacturers are going to see this and are going to say ‘we should do that, this is the connected framework people are going to want when they buy these cars,'” Schippers said. They key to driving appeal among other makers of EVs will be showing the momentum they’ve already captured with the Tesla community, and growing that with Tesla’s forthcoming entry into the mass market will be a key step toward that goal.

“We already have a huge percentage of the Model X and Model S owners on the beta, and now we need to really focus on getting to the Model 3,” he added. “Once we get to the Model 3, I think it’s game over. Once we get to the Model 3, I think we’ll really be able to show what you can do with a massive amount of data.”
That includes things like crowdsourcing information about Supercharger occupancy, as well as putting a finer point on real-world range that incorporates factors like weather and road conditions, as well as hyper-local gas pricing to show you more exactly how much you’re saving. But it also means extending the app’s current connected controls, which allow remote unlocking and climate settings, to the connected home, too.
“People that drive Teslas, they have a Nest [connected thermostat], so we’ll be able to start doing things from the car to the home,” Schippers explains. “We’ll be able to pre-condition your house, we’ll be able to pre-condition your oven, because we know where you are in space. Once we know where you are in space, then we can connect all the other devices.”

513,Car celebrity Richard Hammond talks about launching the DriveTribe startup,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/17/car-celebrity-richard-hammond-talks-about-launching-the-drivetribe-startup/,2017/02/17,"
DriveTribe, the content startup aimed at motoring enthusiasts, was launched last year by former Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May as a new approach to the realm of online community. It was a natural move to leverage their global fame into a new project, off the back of the launch of their new online TV show The Grand Tour, on Amazon Prime — but DriveTribe isn’t just another website about cars.


Instead of acting like a traditional publishing site, DriveTribe has woven social media deep into the infrastructure of what it does. This is a site slightly reminiscent of Pinterest, but with the look and feel of a good-looking publishing site. It features “Tribes” hosted by the three celebrities, along with invited stars, bloggers, writers and videographers, who generate and curate the content.
The startup has now secured a total of $12 million in funding, including a funding round from 21st Century Fox, and was co-founded by serial technology entrepreneur Ernesto Schmitt.
I went to meet Hammond to discuss exactly what it is they are trying to do.
Anyone with an interest in cars can gather on DriveTribe, and it’s clearly taking on a massive subject. Others have tried to aggregate the driving-enthusiast community, but he says that as well as harnessing the collective fame of the Clarkson, Hammond and May “brand,” they’ve also built an experience that is highly social.
He says he’s been on a “huge and exciting learning curve” in launching the startup.
He’s also realized that “just because it’s a tech business doesn’t mean it’s distilled down to zeros and ones. It’s still organic. It still has people at its heart.”
He brushes off the idea that conversations about cars will go away once we have driverless cars to ferry us around: “Well that means it’s the most exciting time to talk about cars… driverless cars won’t replace our desire to drive cars… it’s still about display, power, it’s primal… it’s always something we’ll want to do.”

514,"Car startup Beepi sold for parts after potential exits to Fair, and then DGDG, broke down",https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/16/car-startup-beepi-sold-for-parts-after-potential-exits-to-fair-and-then-dgdg-broke-down/,2017/02/16,"
Yet more developments for Beepi, the used car marketplace that had raised $150 million but then went bust: The company has completely shut down and has been sold off in parts to repay creditors. The development comes after a deal to sell itself to Fair.com, a stealth startup from car industry vets, was cancelled; and then a second deal to sell itself to Bay Area-based used car dealer group DGDG fell through, TechCrunch has confirmed with people close to the company.
With no more cash for operations, Beepi instead went through an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors (ABC process), with advisory firm Sherwood Partners as the Assignee, the firm confirmed to TechCrunch. The Wall Street Journal first reported the assignment of Sherwood Partners to sell off the assets yesterday.
The development wasn’t a complete surprise. After we initially reported in December that Beepi, out of money, would be sold to Fair.com, we’d been trying to hunt down the latest on the situation, when we noticed that the sale announcement was marked as “cancelled” on Crunchbase in January (now mysteriously turned back again to “pending“); and we started to receive emails from people saying that the site had completely shut down and was not processing any sales, or refunds for sales.
However, the only reply we received to our questions to Beepi, Fair and investors came from Beepi’s Owen Savir, who co-founded the company with Alejandro Resnik. He emailed on January 19 that he and the company were “just setting up for the next steps.”
(January 19 appears to also be the last day that Beepi’s Twitter account tweeted anything other than responses to customers contacting it with problems. The Beepi site, similar to Savir’s wording in his email, also notes: “Stay tuned for our next steps.”)
And now we have found out more details.
According to our sources close to the company, the deal to sell Beepi to Fair.com was cancelled by the startup over disagreements on the conditions of the sale.
Then Beepi received a second offer from DGDG, a chain of car dealerships across the Bay Area. But as DGDG was going through its sales process, Beepi ran out of money and had to shut down, and DGDG walked away, too. There were also informal discussions with Carmax, one source tells us.
Fair.com and DGDG had similar financial offers: investors would have received about 35 percent in the new company, and the buyer would have invested around $20 million into restructuring the business.
Good idea, bad execution
Beepi is a textbook case of a startup with a good idea — a marketplace for people to sell and buy used cars, which would be vetted, processed and delivered to the new owner by Beepi, bypassing the costly overhead and commission structure of car dealerships. And there was some solid execution — strong customer service was a big selling point. But ultimately the company was run badly.
It had been valued as high as $560 million in previous rounds of funding, after raising money from 35 investors, including Yuri Milner, Comerica, Redpoint, Foundation Capital, Sherpa Capital and Fabrice Grinda.
But Beepi, a source tells us, was run with the wrong priorities. One ex-employee said Beepi was burning through around $7 million a month when it had its peak of 300 employees (before laying off 200 in December as part of its bid to sell to Fair.com).
A large part of burn was going to “grossly high salaries” and overtime. But, as one claimed, there were also many expenses that pointed to a company that was not economizing, spending money on things like a $10,000 sofa for the executives’ private conference room, and covering phone and car expenses for the founders’ significant others. “There was a definite abuse of funds,” an ex-employee said.
The co-founders, he added, were also very hands-on executives, but possibly to a fault, micro-managing decisions and also “very mercurial and hard to predict.”
And this is before considering some of the administrative problems at the company: one ongoing issue was getting titles and plates sent to new car owners in a timely manner. More than once, people would get pulled over and ticketed for having expired temporary registrations.
Riding on the hype of transportation startups and marketplaces, Beepi may have raised too much, too soon. “They were running the business to raise money, and then to get someone else to take it on,” was how one person described it.
One investor in the startup said that the founders were too aggressive in pushing for higher valuations. Indeed, co-founder Resnik, the CEO, told the WSJ in 2015 that it was looking to raise a “monster round” of $300 million at a $2 billion valuation to fuel its national expansion.
“Entrepreneurs should not always be raising at too high a price because it sets you up for a failure,” the investor said.
And failure, unfortunately, is exactly where it all ended.
When the market became tighter for late-stage growth rounds in the autumn period (the value was literally halved from $12 billion in 2015 to $6 billion in 2016), Beepi stalled. Employees were told in a speech towards the end of 2016 that there was another $90 million in funding from a Chinese investor that fell through (this is further to a $70 million round from August 2015, from another Chinese investor, car company SAIC). But one of our sources says the term sheets for this were never there to begin with, and questions whether that round was ever really a possibility at all.
Turning back to today, we may still see some form of Beepi emerge somewhere.
From what we understand, “Fair.com came back into the picture” after the initial sale to Fair.com, and then DGDG, fell through, said a source. It was looking to buy code, pricing algorithms, the brand and to hire about 23 Beepi employees.
Martin Pichinson, a co-president at Sherwood, would not provide any comment about how the sale has proceeded and who has acquired the assets.
In any case, a source told us that all of the assets have effectively been sold off to someone, including the company’s brand. (This, however, has been disputed.) It’s not clear if this will settle all of the startup’s debts: one source said that at the end of January, Beepi was still coming up about $6 million short on what it owed to its creditors.
Update: After this article was published, we received the following statement from the two founders. We have followed up with a further request for more elaboration, especially regarding what they dispute. (We have been trying to get more detail and to talk to Beepi for weeks to tell its side of the story).

“Regardless of the many inaccuracies in this report, this is a sad time for Beepi and everyone involved.

We set out on an ambitious mission to build a massive company and radically transform a decades-old industry, and stopped well short of the goal line. We take full responsibility for that, and for letting our investors and our incredible, passionate and dedicated team members down.



Still, we take enormous pride in what we’ve built together, in pushing a stale industry forward to the benefit of consumers, and in the thousands and thousands of smiles we put on the faces of our buyers and sellers. The Beepi spirit lives on.

Down, but not out.”

515,Trucks will talk to each other using Peloton Technology,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/16/trucks-will-talk-to-each-other-using-peloton-technology/,2017/02/16,"
Many studies have been done on the potential effects of semi trucks being able to travel in platoons. It could be more fuel-efficient, it could be safer, it could be easier on the drivers. And now, it could be coming to a highway near you. Peloton Technology has partnered with Omnitracs, a fleet management company, to provide platooning technology this year.
Peloton is going to fill pre-orders for its Class 8 truck platooning system in 2017. This will enable two semi trucks to platoon using V2V communications and radar, with one leading and one following. The system is like radar-based cruise control on steroids, with the trucks themselves sharing basic positional and driving information.
Not that the trucks are driving themselves; this is not autonomous technology. The driver is still in charge of steering and will still need to pay attention to the road. This system will work like adaptive cruise control with automatic emergency braking, but the V2V layer enables the follow truck to engage that automatic braking within a tenth of a second of the lead truck hitting the brakes. This, according to Peloton Technology, meets the SAE definition for Level 1 autonomy.
Each platoon is so far limited to two trucks, so you won’t run into huge convoys of linked trucks taking up miles of roadway. And the cloud-based system further limits the use of platooning to specified roads in safe driving conditions. As with all semi-autonomous systems available today, when things get tricky, the human has to take over.
The most immediate benefit, according to Peloton Technology’s calculations, is the fuel efficiency. The lead truck in one of these platooning pairs will see 4.5 percent fuel savings, and the follow truck will see 10 percent. Omnitracs customers who have the Peloton system fitted to their trucks will be able to route pelotoning pairs as often as possible.

516,Aston Martin will focus on cybersecurity before developing a self-driving Lagonda,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/16/aston-martin-will-focus-on-cybersecurity-before-developing-a-self-driving-lagonda/,2017/02/16,"
Aston Martin CEO Dr. Andy Palmer was on stage at the Canadian International Auto Show on Thursday in Toronto, kicking off the event with the North American unveil of the AM-RB 001, Aston Martin’s new hypercar. The fancy car is pretty cool, if that’s your bag (it presumably goes fast and is good-looking, as you can see below), but Palmer’s comments on autonomous driving led his remarks, and they’re especially interesting coming from the Chief Executive of a company that makes cars people thrill to drive.
Palmer said that it’s “no longer a question of if, but when” with regards to an autonomous driving future – in other words, the CEO of a company that makes cars adored by the same people who decry the idea of having control over their precious metal conveyance box taken away from them is acknowledging that it’s now basically curtains for primarily manually driven vehicles. Palmer also offered an anecdote from his personal life, noting that his children don’t place personal value or identity in getting access to cars – they derive these things from other sources, including apps, mobile devices and social networks.
That, combined with the rapid advances in technology and investment in vehicle automation, are contributing to a trajectory that puts us on a path to autonomous cars, according to Palmer. But that doesn’t mean Aston Martin is getting out of the luxury sports car market. In fact, Palmer added that “full autonomy is unlikely to be a near-term goal for a luxury sports car manufacturer,” and reiterated that truly autonomous tech is still a ways off.

Still, Palmer said that advancements in self-driving tech will help in the near-term with features including advanced driver assist and safety offerings. And while he brought up his company’s plans to develop an autonomous Lagonda eventually, he said that before things proceed to that stage he believes the industry needs to focus on basics first – basics including defines against cyber attacks, where Palmer said the “real battleground exists today.”
Palmer cautioned all car companies to ensure that “before we beta test our customers, let us understand the technologies,” including issues like connectivity, and what happens in situations where situational observation from sensors might not be sufficient, but where getting a 4G connection also isn’t possible. He made it clear that Aston Martin will ensure these basic questions are answered long before developing or fielding any kind of autonomous vehicle.
Still, it’s very interesting to hear a luxury sports automobile company CEO speak at such length about autonomous driving tech, particularly when he’s just unveiled, and is standing next to, one of the most elaborate and expensive odes to human-powered driving ever created. Aston Martin has previously expressed interest in autonomy as a way to provide luxury and comfort in settings where the thrill of driving isn’t available anyway – like when you’re stuck in traffic – but its clear the company’s thinking around this area continues to mature.

Mobile and enterprise are the keys to VR/AR scale




Uber has always been a bit of a wild card in local advertising. It knows where you’re going and where you’ve been, which has bred speculation about delivering local ads. And consumer buying intent is arguably heightened when Ubering about town.
But I’ve been skeptical about Uber actually delivering ads — the company is careful not to jeopardize a large primary revenue stream with a marginal one. Ads could diminish the rider experience at a time Uber is blitzing user growth.
But for a company with such rapid revenue growth — though still unprofitable — it will need to build incremental revenue to maintain growth when its core business matures. And it’s planting those seeds already.
A few recent moves have begun to triangulate how Uber could do this. It will be all about enhancing the in-ride experience, then, down the road, an ad model. And that won’t involve in-car signage or digital displays, as some have speculated.
Instead, it will be where our attention is already fixed during Uber rides: staring down at the warm glow of our phones. My prediction is that Uber will monopolize that time through personalized and premium content that’s served through the app during rides.
The beginnings of this strategy can already be seen in its recent UI update. The under-recognized feature of that update is what I’m calling “ride mode.” It takes over the app while a trip is underway, including maps, ETA and other useful info.
Some of that already existed, such as a map, but the new UI creates a more tangible portal with options and in-ride utilities. The next step will be content deals that give riders free access to otherwise paid content for the duration of their ride.
Like it did with in-ride Snapchat custom filters, this will involve deals with the likes of Netflix and Spotify, highlighting content that fits your trip duration. Think: Southwest’s “bring your own device,” versus a NYC taxi’s slimy and outdated touchscreens.
The components of an in-car media future are materializing.
Stepping back, this is all bearing toward convergence with another key movement: self-driving cars. A key part of that movement — along with AI and computer vision — is innovating the in-car experience for when you’re no longer driving. “If you think about it as an extension of your house or office, you’re going to have more screen real estate to explore things,” HERE VP of Product Nicholas Goubert recently told me. “To me that’s the evolution of autonomous driving.”
The time this unlocks will grow the media consumption pie — now about 12 hours per day — for the first time since the iPhone hit the streets. An additional 52 minutes per day (the average U.S. round-trip commute) will represent a media and monetization land grab.
Uber’s in-ride mode is one claim to that territory — a content-rich Trojan horse to get us hooked on premium content before wheeling in the ads. That could involve behaviorally targeted branding, as well as ads that steer you toward local haunts.
It’s already shown signs of this: Its new restaurant guide spotlights top destinations in Uber’s most active cities. This was not only an experimental move but a PR one — to get the world ready for data-fueled local suggestions.
Whether it’s Uber or someone else that dominates the land grab for newly unlocked media time, the components of an in-car media future are materializing. Today it’s smartphones; tomorrow it will be VR headsets, as well as holographic media and AR.
“We’re working with car OEMs to have heads-up displays in the car,” said Goubert. “We see that more and more in the [request for quotes] from manufacturers. So that’s something that’s already happening and will be throughout in the market in 2017.”

518,"U.S. motor vehicle deaths see biggest two year jump in over 50 years, per NSC",https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/15/u-s-motor-vehicle-deaths-see-biggest-two-year-jump-in-over-50-years-per-nsc/,2017/02/15,"
Deaths resulting from motor vehicle crashes are at their highest in nearly a decade, according to preliminary data released by the National Safety Council on Wednesday. The increase for 2016 combines with the jump in 2015 to add up to the largest two-year increase in motor vehicle-related deaths in 53 years, an increase NSC President and CEO Deborah A.P. Hersman noted in a release is at least partly attributable to “complacency” on the part of drivers.
The preliminary numbers from the NSC aren’t final, and the organization says that it’ll experience slight increases or decreases as more data comes in and more analysis is performed. But the estimates usually don’t see dramatic shifts, so you can expect their early estimate of roughly 40,000 motor vehicle deaths in 2016 to remain consistent. The tally represents a 6 percent increase over last year, and a 14 percent bump when compared to the numbers from two years ago in 2014.
The trend towards growing motor vehicle deaths is alarming, and has caught the attention of regulators and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. NHTSA issued an open call for assistance in making sense of the raw data last year, releasing it in bulk early as way to help spur finding some answers.
The NSC, which holds a charger from the U.S. Congress, also conducted a survey that indicates some possible causes for the steady increases, including speed, texting via touch input or voice, as well as driving while under the influence. The nonprofit organization also offered some recommendations, including ignition locks for all convicted drunk drivers, automated enforcement for speed limit violations, full bans on cell phones including hands-free kits and more.
One thing the NSC does not comment on is the use of fully autonomous vehicle technology, though it does advise accelerated standardization and introduction of features including automatic emergency warning, blind spot monitoring and lane departure warning systems.
Many studies and observers cite the rise of mobile devices and their growing role in our lives as a possible cause behind the recent spike in traffic fatalities. NHTSA has proposed rules that would impose more strict use of mobile devices at the level of the OS and individual devices, with increased responsibility on operating system providers like Apple and Google. But others argue that the cat is already out of the bag, so to speak, and the way forward is actually via autonomous vehicle systems.
Industry executives presented views along those lines to a U.S. Congressional panel on Tuesday, asking them to consider regulation for autonomous vehicle tech that doesn’t restrict innovation in the field.

519,Honda partners with new DRIVE smart mobility startup hub in Tel Aviv,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/15/honda-partners-with-new-drive-smart-mobility-startup-hub-in-tel-aviv/,2017/02/15,"
Honda is extending its courtship of startups through its Xcelerator program with a new partnership announced Wednesday with DRIVE, a new startup hub in Tel Aviv, Israel that focuses specifically on smart mobility tech, including transportation and automotive solutions. The partnership will see Honda’s Silicon Valley Lab work directly with the DRIVE center, offering “expertise, funding and rapid prototyping opportunities” to some of the facility’s companies, with the understanding that in future these could “evolve into additional business relationships.”
Honda isn’t the only partner on board for the new DRIVE center initiative – also joining as sponsors are Hertz Rent a Car and Volvo, among others. The launch of the facility by Mayer Group comes at a perfect moment in time in terms of capitalizing on the growing interest in the tech sector around not only automotive innovation, but also urban transit and automated transportation in general.
Honda has been keen to work with the startup community, and has used those partnerships to drive actual product development. In a tie-up with startup VocalZoom, Honda debuted a concept demo at CES this year that use optical sensors to offer better voice recognition – these sensors watch a speaker’s face to supplement data gathered by microphones.
Partnering with, and fostering promising startups is a smart strategy, and one that Honda’s global head of R&D activities Yoshiyuki Matsumoto told me at CES in January is part of the company’s overall approach to finding the best solution to any problem, whether that be through internal sourcing, external partnership or acquisition.

520,Jaguar launches in-car payments at Shell gas stations,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/14/jaguar-launches-in-car-payments-at-shell-gas-stations/,2017/02/14,"
In a first for in-car convenience features, Jaguar is teaming up with Shell to launch a new payment feature that lets you use Apple Pay or PayPal (with Android Pay coming later on) to easily pay for gas right within their vehicles at the pumps. The feature is coming to the UK first, but will roll out around the world after that.
The feature requires installation of the Shell app to make the payments possible, but it’ll show up on your Jaguar’s in-car infotainment touchscreen display once installed, You can then pay using either your PayPal or Apple Pay credentials as mentioned, and all of this is available as of Wednesday in the UK – provided you’ve got a new model Jaguar XE, XF and F-PACE car.
The app lets the driver select how much gas they want, then pre-pay for their fuel. It also shows a receipt of the payment on the display itself, and forwards along a copy to your email address.

It’s true that a lot of pumps support payment at the pump via credit or debit card, but this is an even more convenient system since you never even have to take out your wallet. It’s also a sign of things to come – in-car payment methods that use retailer and service provider apps, combined with stored digital payment methods like Apple and Android Pay, as well as instant receipts and transaction records seem like a huge opportunity, now that vehicles are increasingly networked and equipped with geolocation services.
Here’s hoping Jaguar owners aren’t the only ones who get to enjoy this luxury for long.

521,Daimler’s Smart will focus on electric vehicles exclusively in North America,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/14/daimlers-smart-will-focus-on-electric-vehicles-exclusively-in-north-america/,2017/02/14,"
The adorable little Smart cars you see on North American roads from here on out will likely be primarily electric, as the company has decided to cease sales of its gas-powered Fortwo and Fortwo Cabrio in the U.S. and Canada from 2017 on.
It sounds like the decision has less to do with overwhelming demand for electric Smart cars, however, and more to do with the North American market’s tremendous preference for crossovers, SUVs and larger vehicles, all of which remained resilient categories in a year that was challenging for consumer car sales for many manfacturers. The micro segment, where the Fortwo remains one of only a few options, did not fare well in 2016, with Fortwo selling only just over 6,000 units in total for the year, as Roadshow notes.
The EV versions of the cars didn’t make up a huge percentage of those sales, either, according to Automotive News, comprising only 25 percent of sales in 2014. But the EV strategy with Smart is more about maintaining a foothold in what could become the next big market – and restricting options could drive more customers interested in the Smart lineup to begin with to go for the zero emission options that remain.
As a city runabout and second car, Smart’s Fortwo with an electric powertrain make a ton of sense, with an estimated range of 76 miles in regular city driving conditions. Still, this could also just be the first step in a general end of the line move for Smart in North America, especially if buyer habits continue to trend towards crossovers and trucks.

522,Watch Drive.ai’s self-driving car handle California city streets on a rainy night,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/14/watch-drive-ais-self-driving-car-handle-california-city-streets-on-a-rainy-night/,2017/02/14,"

Autonomous vehicle system startup Drive.ai is ready to show off its technology in use for the first time, with a video showing the company’s test vehicle making its way through the streets of Mountain View.
Other companies have shown us similar videos, of course, including GM-owned Cruise very recently, and Tesla. But Drive.ai’s demonstration is interesting because it depicts incident-free, unbroken footage shot at night, including extensive segments where it’s raining quite a bit.
These are impressive because inclement weather and nighttime driving are particularly challenging for autonomous driving software, owing to factors like reduced visibility for optical sensors and a lot more interference with sensors in general because of the added noise created by the rain. Road conditions are also obviously affected by precipitation, and requires a different style of driving to navigate effectively (something a lot of human California drivers seem surprised to learn).
Some of the majorly impressive moments in the video include a point where another vehicle cuts in front of the Drive.ai car at a four-way stop intersection, and another near the two-minute mark where the car successfully manages a red light that’s knocked out and acting as a four-way stop as a result.
In case you missed Drive.ai’s launch in August last year, the company is employing deep learning and neural networks to teach its autonomous driving systems, and is focused on using said technologies not only for identifying and detecting objects, but also for decision-making and even communication with other drivers and passengers, an area it thinks is just as important as the driving itself.
Drive.ai CEO Sameep Tandon provided the following statement regarding the video and the startup’s testing to TechCrunch:

Today we released the first public video of self-driving technology from the Drive.ai team. In the video, you will see our system navigate the streets of Mountain View, CA not only in daylight, but also in the rain and at night. These are conditions drivers encounter every single day. Any successful self-driving technology will need to address countless unpredictable situations and a wide range of driving conditions, yet few are able to today.
Drive.ai’s unique deep learning technology processes information and makes decisions more like the human brain does. Our technology allows us to scale to all kinds of challenging environments.
As one of the few startups in California with an Autonomous Vehicle Testing Permit, we are prioritizing our responsibility to develop technology that is safe in all conditions. We know that our team has the expertise to create the future of autonomous transportation. We couldn’t be more excited to share this first look – and bring you along for the ride!

523,Dubai plans to introduce flying drone taxis as early as this summer,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/14/dubai-plans-to-introduce-flying-drone-taxis-as-early-as-this-summer/,2017/02/14,"
A growing number of companies are looking at the viability of airborne, autonomous taxis as a way to ease urban congestion and transportation woes, but the city of Dubai could leapfrog those with a plan to deploy a passenger-carrying drone as early as this summer.
Uber, Airbus and others are still talking about creating test vehicles that would begin transporting cargo first, but Dubai’s Roads & Transportation Agency lead announced (via Mashable) at the World Government Summit in the city that they’re going to begin operating passenger service along predetermined routes starting in July, using the Ehang 184 autonomous quad-opener electric drone to ferry people through the air.
The Ehang 184 is a drone that can carry one passenger with a max weight of 220 pounds, for a distance of 31 miles on one charge and at a top speed of 100 mph. It’s plenty enough for short haul trips across a busy urban landscape. Dubai officials will remotely monitor the drones, and pilot them from a centralized command center, and the city says it’s already started test flying the vehicle in Dubai skies, so this isn’t just pure bluster.

Dubai has proven a wellspring of opportunity for people looking to push the limits of transportation technology. Hyperloop One looks likely to deploy the first active hyperloop transportation system in the city, with a route to Abu Dhabi, for instance, and it’s also piloting a number of self-driving shuttle projects.

524,The day the infotainment died,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/13/the-day-the-infotainment-died/,2017/02/13,"
I wanted to review the 2017 Infiniti Q60 Red sports coupe, in particular its technology, because Infiniti is usually ahead of the curve when it comes to tech. This was my second test of the Q60; I’d had it in November 2016 for a few days but felt I hadn’t had the chance to explore all of its connected services. So I got another full week with it in February 2017.
The Q60 drove great. It handled brilliantly, its seats were supportive, and yes, the tech was top-notch. I had to search for the Bluetooth connection for my phone, but once I found it, setup was easy. There were two screens in the center console: one devoted to navigation and one for everything else, from radio to climate control to apps.
There were only a few ADAS features, like blind spot monitoring and a rearview camera. But I didn’t expect it to be packed with semi-autonomous features, as the Q60 is a sport coupe. It’s built for people who like driving and have the open roads to do it.
Then one day, I hopped in the Q60 to drive to a meeting. As I backed out of the driveway, the screens in the center console flashed. The top one went dark. Even though I was in reverse, the view from the camera was not showing. The parking sensors were still functioning and pinged when they sensed I was near a rosemary bush at the edge of my driveway. The second screen froze on the home screen.
There were buttons on the steering wheel and next to the screens for controlling most functions, including climate and radio. But they’re limited. The speedometer, gas gauge, and tachometer were analog and unaffected. The clock in the instrument cluster was stuck, though. I thought I was going to arrive at my meeting early until I realized the clock was just frozen.
All of this was irritating but not dangerous. I took note of what worked (scrolling through info screens in the instrument cluster) and what didn’t (heated steering wheel; the button is on an infotainment screen). I told friends and colleagues about it and found that Infiniti is not alone in this. In early 2017, a Jeep owner I know had his UConnect system flicker on and off every three minutes or so. A Ford owner told me his SYNC system recently updated while he was driving and using the nav system in an unfamiliar area. A quick internet search turns up forums for any number of manufacturers with drivers seeing the same problem, from Land Rover Range Rovers to the Chevy Spark EV.
These issues are still inconvenient but not mission critical — yet. The clock function in the Infiniti could be important when communicating with other vehicles in a V2V world. The Ford’s navigation system could be part of autonomous driving in the next few years. Could a blue screen of death result in actual death?
There’s still time to develop redundancies that keep mission critical information and communications running even during an ill-timed update. But this is the kind of SNAFU that even at this early stage can erode consumer trust in the autonomous vehicles of the future. It’s frustrating when your phone updates out of the blue or freezes; it’s far more concerning when your car does it.
For what it’s worth, the Infiniti Q60 system worked fine the next time I started the car and every time after that. And when I drove the Q60 months before, I experienced no problems at all.

525,"GM, Toyota set to push U.S. regulators on easing self-driving restrictions",https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/13/gm-toyota-set-to-push-u-s-regulators-on-easing-self-driving-restrictions/,2017/02/13,"
Practical use of self-driving cars requires changes to existing regulatory frameworks – or at least that’s what GM and Toyota are prepared to tell U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday, at a panel convened to review the state of self-driving regulation and proposed guidance on their use and testing set out last year by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
GM and Toyota will testify that current regulatory conditions could negatively impact timelines for actual deployment of autonomous driving systems, delays to which GM says in a written version of its planned remarks seen by Reuters could result in “thousands of preventable deaths.” Toyota Research Institute’s Gill Pratt will tell the House panel that it’s “important the federal government begin looking beyond testing dot deployment of these systems.”
Lyft VP of Public Policy Joseph Okpaku is also set to address the forum, and will reiterate Lyft’s goal of fielding trials of its autonomous vehicle ride-hailing service in cities starting this year. Volvo VP of government affairs will share how the carmaker wanted to test its “Drive Me” pilot in the U.S. in addition to Sweden, but that it’s not currently set to go forward because of the uncertainty around the regulatory environment.
Part of the issues automakers want addressed is the current 2,500 vehicle cap per year from NHTSA rules for cars, which puts an effective cap on the size of autonomous vehicle fleets that can operate. That’s not the only regulatory hurdle the companies must clear, however, and the proposed NHTSA regulations have prompted some pushback from industry players, including notably Toyota, whose North American director of tech and innovation policy highlighted some of the major problems with the suggested rules last year.
Senator Gary Peters (D-MI) and Senator John Thune (R-SD) also announced on Monday that they will lead a joint effort to pursue legislation that “clears hurdles and advances innovation in self-driving technology.” New U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao has also said she favours seeking partnerships with industry to find the way forward on issues including self-driving, and will seek to establish a regulatory framework that isn’t “dampening” the creativity of industry and innovation, while still respecting the privacy and safety of individuals.

526,Volkswagen and Mobileye team to help autonomous cars ‘see’ via crowdsourcing,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/13/volkswagen-and-mobileye-team-to-help-autonomous-cars-see-via-crowdsourcing/,2017/02/13,"
Volkswagen and Mobileye have signed an agreement to see Mobileye’s Road Experience Management (REM) mapping service integrated into VW-brand vehicles starting in 2018. The service from provider Mobileye crowdsources real-time road condition reports from vehicles equipped with the product to help provide intelligent fleet features for use in autonomous vehicles, making sure networked smart cars can better navigate real roads.
Cars equipped with REM can track info from front-facing cameras, including lane markings and other road info, and then send that data to the cloud, where it’s collected and fed back into HD navigation maps to make sure those reflect conditions as accurately as possible at all times. Mobileye and Volkswagen intend for this agreement to pave the way for industry-wide collaboration on the REM platform, which would build HD maps using crowdsourced data from the cars of a range of manufacturers, and then help improve the autonomous driving and advanced driver assist features of all those involved.
The new agreement means that Volkswagen models will begin incorporating the REM system in new models in 2018, which will result in anonymized data gathering that can provide insight not only into road conditions, but also into parking space ability and traffic and congestion information.
I actually got the chance to experience Mobileye’s REM system working in Las Vegas at CES during my test drive of Delphi’s autonomous driving system, and the results were impressive, though it’s obviously hard to identify any one component of the system as responsible for its overall proficiency. Still, the concept of ‘smart swarms’ of intelligent, connected cars working in concert is picking up steam, and could be a huge component of our self-driving future.

If you still feel like you were somehow “promised” flying cars based on Popular Science magazine covers in the 1960s then you’re in luck, because Dutch company PAL-V is now accepting pre-orders for its Liberty vehicle, which it calls “the first certified commercial flying car ever.” The three-wheeled ‘car’ has a retractable top-mounted rotor, making it more like a motor trike with gyrocopter skills than a car, per se.
Still, it does both drive and fly, which is double what most cars or aircraft can do reasonably well, and if you want the future now, PAL-V is willing to give it to you – at a price, and you still have to wait a little while longer to actually take delivery. Pricing begins at $400,000, but that’s for a base model before taxes. If you want the proper trim and kit, you’ll spring for the $600,000 “Pioneer” edition, which adds at-home training, power heating, fancy detailing and an electronic flight instrument display instead of the boring old electromechanical option.

You don’t have to pay all of that up front, since PAL-V says it’s aiming at the end of this year for production of test and certification craft, and delivery of fully certified vehicles by the end of 2018. Instead, the company is asking for either a non-refundable deposit of $25,000 for the top trim Pioneer, or $10,000 for the base model Sport – but if that’s too rich you can also put down a $2,500 escrow deposit which can be refunded and which will put you on the waiting list.
Why just a waiting list? Well, it turns out that only 90 of the Pioneer edition are planned for initial construction, so it sounds like the company is expecting a sell-out run of the initial group.
The PAL-V also has specs, in case that’s going to sway your purchase decision, including take-off space that generally will mean you’ll have to use an airfield to get into the sky. It has a 100 mph top ground speed, with a 0-60mph time of around 9 seconds, and it has 817 miles driving distance on a full tank with fuel efficiency of 31mpg.
While airborne, it has a top speed of 112mph, but mileage drops considerably – you’ll have to refuel every 310 miles while flying with the PAL-V, but that’s still enough for jumping airfield to airfield between a lot of cities and towns.

PAL-V also isn’t just any fly-by-night operation: The company has been doing concept testing since at least 2009, and it also founded the first North American flying car school in the U.S. in Utah last year. Still, don’t count your flying cars before they take to the roads and the sky, unless you’ve got at least $10K lying around you’re fine with never seeing again.

528,This Lucid Air electric car winter test video reminds us snow can be good,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/10/this-lucid-air-electric-car-winter-test-video-reminds-us-snow-can-be-good/,2017/02/10,"

Lucid’s Air is a 1,000 HP electric dream car, which is still in the early stages of real-world testing, but which already has more than a few EV fans excited. Now, the company is showing off its winter conditions testing, courtesy of a video shot in Minnesota that makes the state far more appealing than any tourism bureau marketing I’ve ever seen.
The video includes footage shot during the Lucid team’s testing, which was designed to help it prove out its computer-based simulations in actual snow, ice and mixed road conditions. The temperatures during these drives reached lows of -18F, which is cold even by my subarctic Canadian standards.
As anyone who does a lot of snow driving can tell you, all we do is try to achieve maximum, Fast and Furious-style drift arcs, all the time – whether we’re out for a quick trip to grab some groceries, or just doing our daily commute.
No but really this looks super fun, and yet also under control (at the hands of experts, of course), which is right in keeping with Lucid’s pitch that the Air will be a vehicle built for drivers. The Air is still aiming for 2018 for a production time frame, and should hit around the $100,000 mark for pricing, in case you want to start saving those pennies for this winter warrior.

529,Subaru is the latest to get a self-driving test licence in California,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/10/subaru-is-the-latest-to-get-a-self-driving-test-licence-in-california/,2017/02/10,"
The California DMV has added Subaru as the latest member of its list of companies clear to test autonomous driving technology on state roads, bringing the exclusive club to 22 members in total. Subaru is the car-making wing of Japanese transportation company Fuji Heavy Industries, and makes vehicles including the popular Forester and Outback lines.
Subaru already offers advanced driver assist features via its ‘EyeSight’ branded options, with plans to introduce new features including traffic jam autonomous navigation and steering, which is designed to work in traffic with speeds of up to 40 mph. The company also aims to offer highway driving semi-autonomy capabilities by 2020, which will include lane switching and following the road round bends and curves.
California is a target for a lot of companies looking to field autonomous or semi-autonomous driving features in the near future, because of the permitting program introduced by the state’s DMV that makes it possible to run trials on public highways and city streets for companies including automakers and technology providers that meet its requirements and pay its modest lacewings fee.

530,Nissan’s X-Wing Rogue is the crossover SUV the galaxy needs right now,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/10/nissans-x-wing-rogue-is-the-crossover-suv-the-galaxy-needs-right-now/,2017/02/10,"
Nissan has a Star Wars-themed version of its Rogue SUV that capitalizes on its name’s relation to Star Wars, and Rogue One in particular. The full-size modified vehicle adds exterior ‘engines’ and a custom paint job to create a Rogue that looks like something out of my fever dreams (I own a Rogue and I love Star Wars).
Here’s what I love about this: They cared enough to add fake weathering and scoring to the paint job, which results in something approximating the “lived in” nature of the Star Wars universe. Also, the R2 unit poking out the top, which I will do my utmost best to recreate at home using the tools available to me.
The X-Wing Rogue debuted at the Chicago Auto Show this week, along with two limited edition Star Wars variants of the Rogue, which basically include special decals, badging and a full-size Death Trooper helmet for collectors, or for protecting your dome as you storm planets I suppose.
The X-Wing version is not a real trim option. sadly, but if it was that would be my next vehicle. If it was I WOULD ALREADY OWN IT AND NO FORCE IN THE UNIVERSE COULD STOP ME.

531,Esri helps move masses for marches,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/09/esri-helps-move-masses-for-marches/,2017/02/09,"
Since President Trump took office, there have been protests large and small across the United States and around the globe. Esri, the big-data collection and analysis company, has helped communities using its services plan for these large-scale events and adapt when things don’t go as planned.
“Whenever there’s a march or a disruption, there’s lots of factors to take into consideration across the community to minimize disruption and allow critical services and keep everyone safe,” said Chris McIntosh at Esri. If protesters are blocking a section of downtown streets, which routes can ambulances use to get where they need to go quickly and safely? Will it affect trash pick-up routes that day? Or school buses? “If you throw a rock into a pond, the ripples flow out,” McIntosh said.
Esri takes the location as a framework and uses the context of that location to figure out what an event’s impact is going to be on a community. For example, how many people do organizers expect to show up for an event? Can the park where they’re planning to meet hold that many people, or will they spill into nearby streets?
McIntosh says Esri specializes in “the science of where” — not just where things are, but what it means to the people, the government and the services in an area. “That’s what allows you to effectively manage these kinds of events,” he said in a phone interview.
This includes transit. “When you have people coming in for any gathering — the Boston Marathon or a protest march in downtown Portland — transit has to deal with demand,” McIntosh said. “You may need to up the number of buses on this line or provide crowd control in subway stations.” Managing the movement of people in and out of the area is critical to a peaceful and successful event.
Getting that information out  via Waze or other apps to other people not part of the event, who might be commuting or shopping, helps as well. A city’s command center can tell anyone not at the event to avoid a street that’s being blocked by protesters or used for a race. It also can suggest alternative routes. “We can share that data very, very easily,” McIntosh said.
The sticking point isn’t the technology — “That’s the easy part,” McIntosh said. It’s getting all of a community’s agencies on board before the permit for a protest comes across someone’s desk. Agencies have to know who is receiving what data and who shares information with whom. “That has to be done in advance on a blue-sky day,” McIntosh said.
He noted that Boston is a good example of planning. Since they already use data to coordinate for the Boston Marathon every year, they were able to adjust for the New England Patriots’ victory parade after Super Bowl LI pretty easily. “The work they do 364 days a year for the marathon was leveraged for the parade — or for anything else that comes along,” McIntosh said.
He said cities like Boston and Washington, DC that use data to manage their everyday functions are better off when a large-scale event occurs, even if it’s larger than expected. “Understanding context every day sets them up for success when a protest comes up,” he said.

532,Tesla answers claims of poor factory working conditions and unionization efforts,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/09/tesla-answers-claims-of-poor-factory-working-conditions-and-unionization-efforts/,2017/02/09,"
Jose Moran, who claims to be a Tesla employee working at the company’s Fremont, California assembly facility, took to Medium on Thursday to detail working conditions at the company, and to detail efforts on behalf of factory employees to unionize, an initiative in the beginning stages of being supported by the United Autoworkers Union, the U.S. automotive industry’s largest labor union.
In his post, Moran claims that Tesla factory employees earn less than the national average for auto workers, despite residing in the Bay area, where the cost of living is much higher than where most car factories reside. Moran says in the post that Tesla has begun to respond to worker concerns, with a base pay raise in November, yet it also has taken steps that seem to run counter to employee organization, including asking workers to sign a new confidentiality policy.
Moran also makes an appeal to Tesla management’s desire for more smoothly run production operations, likely an attempt to get through to the company as it gears up for Model 3 production and will need to focus on maximizing efficiency.
A Tesla spokesperson provided the following response to Moran’s post:
As California’s largest manufacturing employer and a company that has created thousands of quality jobs here in the Bay Area, this is not the first time we have been the target of a professional union organizing effort such as this. The safety and job satisfaction of our employees here at Tesla has always been extremely important to us. We have a long history of engaging directly with our employees on the issues that matter to them, and we will continue to do so because it’s the right thing to do.
Gizmodo also received direct comments from Elon Musk via Twitter DM regarding the Medium post and Tesla’s treatment of its employees. Musk countered each of Moran’s claims to Gizmodo, saying that mandatory overtime is occasionally required but that its use is dropping weekly, and noting that starting wages are higher than those offered to UAW employees, with total compensation also exceeding equivalent UAW wages when you factor in stock grants.
Musk doesn’t claim to be anti-union in the exchange with Gizmodo, referring instead to his company as “union neutral,” and he characterizes the Medium post an “attack” that’s “morally outrageous” and potentially funded by UAW sources in order to further its agenda of creating a union at Tesla.

GM’s Maven car-sharing service has now launched in Atlanta, its 17th North American city, where it’ll offer a fleet of 50 cars spread across 20 pick-up locations. Maven launched in January 2016, and began a rapid series of expansions that took it to locations across the U.S. throughout last year. It allows users to rent GM vehicles on-demand for short periods, similar to how Zipcar and car2go operate, without any membership fees.
Maven also revealed that it now has over 20,000 members signed up, and that combined its users have traveled a total of 57 million miles thus far. Maven offers a range of top trim GM vehicles, including Chevrolet and Cadillac options, and all come with on-board connectivity, with rental fees covering not only time with the vehicle, but also mileage, gas and insurance costs.
GM continues to explore a number of different alternative transportation solutions as it looks to grow beyond traditional car sales, but Maven may be one of its more interesting current efforts, especially once you start looking ahead to a future where automakers employ autonomous fleets to support shared ownership models.

534,Tesla said to be aiming to start test production of Model 3 on February 20,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/09/tesla-said-to-be-aiming-to-start-test-production-of-model-3-on-february-20/,2017/02/09,"
Tesla is pausing production at its California assembly plant in Fremont in order to prepare for Model 3 production, the company announced on Wednesday, and Reuters reports via separate sources that it will look to start test production of its Model 3 on February 20, ahead of planned wide-scale production beginning sometime later this year.
The Model 3 is Tesla’s more affordable all-electric vehicle, which has seen over 373,000 pre-orders and which will offer a range of at least 215 miles with pricing starting at $35,000 U.S. before government tax incentives. The vehicle will test the limits of Tesla’s production capability, since the company’s CEO Elon Musk has said they’re targeting production volume of 500,000 cars per year by 2018, in response to strong demand for the Model 3. Tesla is currently making around 100,000 vehicles per year, based on its production total for the final quarter of 2016.
Test production of the vehicle could help the company finalize design details, a process which sources told Reuters is still underway. The stated production start date target for the Model 3 is July 2017, a date considered very ambitious given internal progress, according to Reuters’ sources. Musk himself has also noted these dates may change depending on supplier ability to meet Tesla’s requirements.
Tesla faces more pressure than ever regarding getting Model 3 production underway, since Chevrolet has made good on its promise to produce and begin sales of its own Bolt EV with a 200+ mile range and price tag under $30,000 once you bake in green car incentives. The company also has a lot to prove in terms of investors, so any signal it can provide that it’s on its way to production at scale will be welcome.

535,Watch Cruise’s self-driving Bolt EV navigate smoothly to SF’s Dolores Park,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/08/watch-cruises-self-driving-bolt-ev-navigate-smoothly-to-sfs-dolores-park/,2017/02/08,"

GM-owned Cruise Automation wants you to be able to see the progress it’s making with its self-driving car tests, in a way that’s more tangible than looking at boring lists of disengagement reports. That’s why it’s been publishing videos of its Cruise test cars navigating real city streets, and a new episode of that video series is available now, showing a Bolt EV equipped with Cruise’s software making its way around San Francisco’s Dolores Park neighbourhood.
The video includes a handy on-screen indicator showing when it’s in autonomous mode, which appears to be throughout the entire course of the sped up footage. Kyle Vogt, Cruise CEO, provided the following statement about the conditions of the drive in an emailed statement:
This video was captured from one of our autonomous vehicles during a series of back to back test rides. No advance planning was done, and this was captured in a single take. The operator selected a random destination using the Cruise mobile app, pushed a button, and the vehicle started moving. Rides like this occur hundreds of times per day across our test fleets.
The point Vogt is making is that this Cruise demo video shows real-world capabilities, in unpredictable circumstances. Of course, GM still gets to choose what videos it release, but that’s still impressive if you’ve ever spent any time as a passenger in any self-driving vehicles. At one point the Cruise vehicle manages navigating around a stopped moving truck that’s blocking a full lane, for instance, and it also deals with multiple pedestrians and at least one bike rider with seeming ease.
GM has test vehicles on the road in San Francisco, Arizona and Michigan, and plans to build future self-driving vehicles based on the Bolt platform in its assembly facility near Lake Orion, Mich.

536,Ford plug-in hybrid sales rose 38% in 2016,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/08/ford-plug-in-hybrid-sales-rose-38-in-2016/,2017/02/08,"
Ford saw some significant year-over-year growth in its plug-in hybrid sales in 2016, despite gas prices that on average saw historic lows throughout the year. The total number of hybrids sold by Ford numbered 23,895 – which doesn’t seem like a lot, but in relative terms it’s a large jump, and Ford’s hybrid lineup is still relatively modest and focused on only a few market segments for now, while the company has big plans to expand its offerings by 2020.
Ford’s current lineup includes the Fusion Hybrid, C-MAX Hybrid, C-MAX Energy and Focus Electric, as well as the Fusion Energy, which saw its highest ever growth in sales during 2016 with a 63 percent increase over its sales in 2015, helping drive Ford to its record 18 percent ownership of the total electrified vehicle market during the most recent sales year.
Not surprisingly, the coasts are hot spots for sales of Ford’s hybrid lineup, including the Energi, which saw sales double in the New York area, and continues to see strong sales in both LA and California. Ford’s also emphasizing that this uptick in sales is especially noteworthy not just because consumers have typically shown decreased interested in electrified vehicles when fuel prices go down, but also because car sales overall saw a big dip in the year vs. SUV and crossovers, which are seeing significant growth.
All of which suggests Ford will remain committed to its goal of offering a range of 13 electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles by 2020, including a fully electric SUV with a max range of at least 300 miles per EPA rating standards. The category may still be very young, and small in relative terms to overall vehicle sales, but growth like this bodes well for long-term trends.

537,Waze Carpool completes its Bay Area rollout and adds three new partners,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/07/waze-carpool-completes-its-bay-area-rollout-and-adds-three-new-partners/,2017/02/07,"
After expanding to the Bay Area in a pilot last September, Waze Carpool is now officially open to all in the nine counties that make up the region, and also in Northern California from Sacramento to Monterey, the company announced. This marks the proper launch for the Google-owned collaborative ride-sharing tool, which is not so much a competitor for Google as it is a community-focused effort on actually sharing rides to and from work with people who are driving your way already.
Waze Carpool also has three new partners in its efforts to help address Bay Area traffic congestion, including the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC), University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) and Kaiser Permanente, all of whom will now contribute to carpool routes that serve areas that include San Francisco hospital campuses where bus and other transit routes don’t normally reach.
UCSF and Kaiser Permanente are hoping that teaming up with Waze for its carpooling services will help it address the issue of traffic and parking shortages at its Mission Bay, Geary and Parnassus sites, according to the company, and Waze Carpool will now be offered as a part of their existing transportation demand management programs, which seek to drive down the number of single-person cars choking up roadways and available parking.

As it has been since its pilot debut in 2016, Waze Carpool is not seeking to attract professional drivers. Instead, it’s looking to sign up drivers via its Waze app, and riders via the Waze Rider app, and it provides a minor payout from riders to drivers — but not more than the current average federal mileage rate. The whole payment structure is designed to help drivers recoup the cost of gas, and perhaps a bit of maintenance, but not much more than that.
Waze doesn’t vet drivers, as a result, and the intent is literally just to facilitate carpooling through a technical solution, since traditional carpooling often fails because of a lack of sustained interest or too much variety in destinations among small groups of friends and coworkers.
New riders get two free rides when they sign up for Waze, and thanks to the partnership, anyone who registers with a UCSF or Kaiser Permanente work email address will also get an additional free ride.

Connected car dongle maker Automatic started out as a consumer-focused company that sought to help give customers more insight into their driving habits, with the aim of helping to gamify things like fuel efficiency, and generally offer up tips for improved driving. It was only natural that it would take its data-collecting dongle and driver improvement business and partner up with insurance providers, who would like nothing more than a more comprehensive look at the drivers they insure.
Automatic’s list of insurance provider partners is fairly long, as a result, and includes industry leaders like Liberty Mutual and more. Now, American Family Insurance is also joining the mix, offering up free access to dongles included with their plans for drivers who enrolled in KnowYourDrive, a program that rewards insurance plan members with an immediate 5 percent discount on their insurance, which can scale up to 40 percent depending on their driving habits over time.
Automatic’s dongle plugs into a vehicles OBD II port, and can access data including speed, braking rate, maintenance requirements and more. American Family Insurance also plans to roll out new features with Automatic, including roadside assistance, and direct claims submission through Automatic’s app – which is made easier since data around what happened in an accident is ready to hand via the OBD II-provided information.
Mutually beneficial distribution deals like this one between Automatic and insurance providers are a smart way for the company to ensure its devices get reach beyond the average early adopter or gadget geek.

Tesla’s P100D variant Model S has hit a new low – a record low time for a 0 to 60 mph acceleration, that is, in a new test conducted by Motor Trend using a stock vehicle with Ludricous+ mode.
The new track test time, via Electrek, also included a 10.5 second quarter-mile, both of which represent new records in terms of measured sprints. The Model S P100D becomes the first production car Motor Trend has ever test that has achieved a 0 to 60 mph speed meter than 2.3 seconds, in fact.
That’s much faster than the originally promised 2.5 second 0 to 60 mph time that the new Ludicrous+ mode (an Easter Egg that owners of the top-specced Teslas can unlock with a recent software update), and faster even than the 2.389 second time recorded by the fan-run Tesla Racing Channel in January.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk did say he though that a 2.3-second time was possible under Motor Trend’s testing conditions on Twitter previously, and this proves that it wasn’t only possible, but was also actually an underestimation of what the car could do. As Elektrek notes, the vehicle does have lighter Arachnid wheels, which may have helped, but they hardly qualify as an aftermarket upgrade since they’re part of the company’s referral program for rewarding Tesla owners who spread the love.

Elon Musk only noted very briefly that there had been “progress” on the matter of the immigration order made during his meeting with Donald Trump’s economics advisory council on Friday, but on Saturday the Tesla CEO shared a bit more about what happened at the event.
Musk said that he specifically requested inclusion of discussion of the travel ban at the closed meeting, as the issue had not been included on the agenda originally. In fact, the Tesla CEO said that because of his intervention, it became the “first and foremost” topic of discussion despite not having been on the list of things for the group to talk about.


At my request, the agenda for yesterday's White House meeting went from not mentioning the travel ban to having it be first and foremost
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 4, 2017



In addition to the immigration order, Musk says he also raised the issue of climate concerns, by way of explaining his continued participation in the council. The CEO said he would indeed remain a member, reaffirming a commitment to stay part of the group he made prior to the meeting, following the resignation from the council of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick in response to both employee and public reaction.


In addition, I again raised climate. I believe this is doing good, so will remain on council & keep at it. Doing otherwise would be wrong.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 4, 2017



One observer pointed out that a federal judge’s ruling has actually overturned the order for now, which she suggested is doing more than Musk’s chosen tactics for voicing his concern. He replied that he believes it should be “addressed on all fronts,” including via judicial, legislative and executive channels. Musk also admitted that he’s not thrilled about participating in politics, since it’s separate from his primary agenda of helping to “invent and develop technologies that improve lives.”
The natural question then is exactly why Musk insists on continuing to work with Trump’s administration when many of his customers seem to vehemently disagree with the CEO’s actions. In fact, some Model 3 pre-order customers are cancelling their reservations as a direct result of Musk’s work with the White House.
It’s hard to say how much Musk’s role in this group is actually “doing good,” as he suggests, given the closed-door nature of the assemblies. This lack of transparency could actually also be grounds for yet more legal action against Trump, in fact, since it looks very likely that it’s a violation of the Federal Advisory Committee Act to not hold these advisory meetings from business leaders open to the public, though the administration denies any of its actions have contravened this order.
Based on the accounts of some other council participants, however, it does seem like climate at least has been a noteworthy part of the agenda. GM CEO and strategic and policy forum member Mary Barra provided TechCrunch with the following statement about her participation in Friday’s meeting via email from a GM spokesperson:
I’m pleased to have been part of a very constructive discussion on how we can all work together on policies that support a strong and competitive U.S. economy, create jobs and address safety and environmental issues. As we have stated, a vibrant U.S. economy that is competitive globally and that grows jobs is what we all want.
While GM has addressed the immigration order issued by Trump last week in an internal memo shared with media from the company’s HR lead John Quattrone, Barra herself has not addressed the executive measure publicly. Of the major U.S. automakers, only Ford CEO Mark Fields has made a statement regarding the order, noting on January 30 in a statement co-authored with Ford Chairman Bill Ford that they “do not support this policy or any other that goes against ours values as a company.”

Ford opened a location that it’s calling the FordHub in the Westfield World Trade Center mall this week — but you won’t be able to buy any cars there.
Instead, the location includes a large screen highlighting different ways (bike, subway and otherwise) to reach New York City landmarks, a ramp-and-marble model that illustrates the idea of traffic congestion and another display that lays out a number of future-of-transporation concepts, like self-repairing roads.

 As pointed out by Ford’s Andrew Birkic, the company’s “core business” is represented in the hub by a wall covered in 5,000 miniature models of Ford vehicles — but that’s about it. Birkic described this as “an opportunity to connect with consumers” and highlight Ford’s transformation “from an automotive to an automotive and mobility company.”
After all, people don’t just get around in cars, especially in big cities in New York, and Ford wants to play a role in those other modes of transportation. For example, Ford Smart Mobility acquired shuttle and ride-sharing startup Chariot last fall.
Birkic said the company is looking to FordHubs in other cities, probably starting with San Francisco. In the meantime, You can watch our tour in the video above.

542,Chevrolet says in-car 4G LTE data use jumped almost 200% in 2016,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/03/chevrolet-says-in-car-4g-lte-data-use-jumped-almost-200-in-2016/,2017/02/03,"
Car makers are increasingly making data connections the default in new vehicles, and it’s having an impact in terms of usage: Chevrolet released numbers today that show in-car use of its OnStar 4G LTE data connection grew by around 200 percent in 2016 vs. 2015. Among its best-selling full-size SUV Tahoe and Suburban drivers specifically, the usage spike was even greater, rising 260 percent.
The total amount of data used among Tahoe and Suburban owners in 2016 was 713,669 GB of data, which Chevrolet notes is equivalent to 3 million hours of streaming video or 25 million hours of streaming music. It’s likely that this will only grow in the future, too, since Chevrolet now makes 4G LTE connectivity standard equipment across its lineup of cars – though service still requires an additional data subscription on the part of the user.
These in-car data usage spikes are significant because they increasingly represent a way for car makers to drive additional revenue post-purchase from car owners. In fact, connected cars could drive 10 times the revenue as ordinary cars over their lifetime, according to a recent industry survey.
Data connectivity will likely only become more important to vehicles and car owners, too, since vehicles are going to lean more heavily on in-car and inter-car communication as autonomous vehicle and driver assistance technology grows. We still might be a decade out from full, truly self-driving automobiles we can use in everyday life, but staking out that connected territory early is going to be smart for automakers looking to profit by it later on.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk issued a statement about his participation in Donald Trump’s economic advisory council, and a scheduled meeting of the group tomorrow. Musk said that he and others on the council will take the opportunity to voice their opposition to the president’s executive order on immigration and suggest how it might be changed.
Musk took the opportunity to specifically note that his being a member of the advisory group is not meant as an endorsement of the council or the administration. It’s likely Musk is feeling pressure from both within and outside Tesla regarding his participation in the council, especially now that former council member and Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has withdrawn.
Musk’s full statement is provided below:

In December, I agreed to join the Presidential Advisory Forum to provide feedback on issues that I think are important for our country and the world. In tomorrow’s meeting, I and others will express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions for changes to the policy.
Advisory councils simply provide advice and attending does not mean that I agree with actions by the Administration. My goals are to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy and to help make humanity a multi-planet civilization, a consequence of which will be the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs and a more inspiring future for all. I understand the perspective of those who object to my attending this meeting, but I believe at this time that engaging on critical issues will on balance serve the greater good.

544,Uber CEO Travis Kalanick quits Donald Trump’s business advisory council,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/02/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-quits-donald-trumps-business-advisory-council/,2017/02/02,"
Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has removed himself from Donald Trump’s economic advisory group, as first reported by both Recode and the New York Times, and confirmed by TechCrunch. Kalanick was set to speak with Trump tomorrow at a meeting of the President’s advisory council on business matters, which was established late last year and which also includes SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. The Uber CEO faced considerable criticism for his decision to work directly with Trump, and his association with the administration was at least in part responsible for the recent #DeleteUber campaign on social media, which resulted in Uber rival Lyft surpassing Kalanick’s app in popularity for the first time.
The move is likely welcome news to both Uber users and even employees, some of whom had expressed publicly their dissatisfaction with Kalanick’s relationship to Trump. In an internal email obtained by the New York Times, Kalanick reportedly told employees that his participation in the council “was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda,” but was “unfortunately” interpreted in that way. An independent organization of Uber drivers based in NYC also said in an email to TechCrunch they were “heartened” that the Uber founder did step down after it launched a petition asking the CEO to do so early on Thursday.
In an earlier response to Trump’s executive order on immigration shared via Facebook, Kalanick expressed his intent to bring concerns regarding the nature of the order to Trump’s attention at the meeting happening Friday:
While every government has their own immigration controls, allowing people from all around the world to come here and make America their home has largely been the U.S.’s policy since its founding. That means this ban will impact many innocent people—an issue that I will raise this coming Friday when I go to Washington for President Trump’s first business advisory group meeting.
Kalanick won’t be able to do that any longer, now that he’s no longer a member of the board, but in his internal email today he noted that he “spoke briefly with the President about the immigration executive order and its issues for our community” while also letting him know that he’d no longer be a part of the council.
Here’s the full text of the memo shared internally by Kalanick with Uber employees, obtained by TechCrunch:Dear Team,
Earlier today I spoke briefly with the President about the immigration executive order and its issues for our community. I also let him know that I would not be able to participate on his economic council. Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the President or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that.I spent a lot of time thinking about this and mapping it to our values. There are a couple that are particularly relevant:
Inside Out – The implicit assumption that Uber (or I) was somehow endorsing the Administration’s agenda has created a perception-reality gap between who people think we are, and who we actually are.
Just Change – We must believe that the actions we take ultimately move the ball forward. There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that. The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America. Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there’s a growing fear the U.S. is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants.
Immigration and openness to refugees is an important part of our country’s success and quite honestly to Uber’s. I am incredibly proud to work directly with people like Thuan and Emil, both of whom were refugees who came here to build a better life for themselves. I know it has been a tough week for many of you and your families, as well as many thousands of drivers whose stories are heartfelt and heart-wrenching.
Please know, your questions and stories on Tuesday, along with what I heard from drivers, have kept me resilient and reminded me of one of our most essential cultural values, Be Yourself. We will fight for the rights of immigrants in our communities so that each of us can be who we are with optimism and hope for the future.

545,All new cars could have V2V tech by 2023,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/02/all-new-cars-could-have-v2v-tech-by-2023/,2017/02/02,"
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recently published a proposed rule to require all new vehicles to have vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication capabilities. It’s not an official requirement yet, but if it goes into effect in 2019 — a likely timeline for rules like this — manufacturers would be able to phase the technology into their fleets over a few years, with all new vehicles being required to talk to each other by 2023.
The rule not only requires the tech to be on board; it also standardizes the messages that vehicles will share. And because you know you love it, there are plenty of acronyms to be found in the rule. Each car on the road would have a dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) unit that sends out and receives basic safety messages (BSMs).
BSMs are really basic and include data like speed, brake status, and heading — nothing private. The proposal specifically says “NHTSA purposely does not require some elements to alleviate potential privacy concerns.” The goal here is just to make sure all vehicles are speaking the same language in short messages.
The rule also sneaks in a requirement that all vehicles be able to receive over-the-air security and software updates, with “consumer consent … where appropriate.” NHTSA would also like to see firewalls built into vehicles between the V2V modules and the rest of the vehicle’s connected modules to keep ne’er-do-wells from accessing other systems.
That’s not to say V2V will work alone. The rule is quite clear in saying that vehicles should use the information received to engage other on-board sensor and safety systems, like automatic emergency braking. NHTSA also calls out the benefits of vehicles communicating in a swarm and helping each other to see beyond the limits of their own sensors and DSRC messages.
Why bother making an official rule when it seems like the technology is advancing in this direction already? Because the government doesn’t think V2V technology is moving fast enough. “Without government action,” the proposed rule says, “these challenges could prevent this promising safety technology from achieving sufficiently widespread use throughout the vehicle fleet to achieve these benefits.”
NHTSA also notes that without requiring this potentially life-saving technology, buyers might not choose to buy it. If you the consumer only see safety benefits from V2V when other cars have it, but not enough other people are choosing to buy it, then you might not bother to buy it either. So NHTSA is just going to make all of us safer, like it or not.
If you have V2V expertise and strong opinions on the topic, you can comment on the proposed rule by April 12, 2017.

546,Faraday Future said to be scaling back its electric car model lineup,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/02/faraday-future-said-to-be-scaling-back-its-electric-car-model-lineup/,2017/02/02,"
Faraday Future is scaling back some of its ambitions, according to Reuters, taking its planed product portfolio from seven electric vehicles to just two, and also reducing the size of its planned assembly factory in Nevada. The factory size reduction was confirmed by a North Las Vegas city manager, and will see the facility occupy less than a third of its original planned footprint.
The report says that Faraday still intends to create a larger facility, but that it will do so later instead of initially, and it has no specific timetable to share in terms of achieving the expansion. The company said it would be building its first assembly facility in Nevada, targeting a yearly output of 150,000 vehicles, back in 2015, and it committed to an investment of over $1 billion in the facility – a commitment which the company told Reuters it still intends to honor. The changed plans will see a capacity of only 10,000 cars per year, at the facility which will open in 2019 instead.
Interestingly, the report also gave us a closer look at what Faraday might be planning beyond its FF 91, the vehicle it unveiled at CES which aims at the high-end luxury segment, and sounds like it could have a price tag of almost $300,000 when it’s released. Reuters says an “FF 81” is planned, too, and is the other vehicle that survived the rethinking of its planned product pipeline. This would be a more affordable crossover vehicle, which would compete directly with the Model X, according to the report.
Faraday faces issues include work stoppages on the facility and a lawsuit from a graphics company due to non-payment of contractors, so it’s understandable to see it scale back its plans. The company’s future is still very much in doubt, but perhaps some of these setbacks will have it avoid making over-bold and splashy statements about its glorious future, which increasingly seem hard to back up.

ClearMotion, a company that’s building an alternative chassis for vehicle makers that replaces traditional physical shock absorbers with digital, software-driven adaptive actuators, has readied $100 million in a Series C round, led by a group of clients advised by J.P. Morgan’s asset management wing and with participation from NEA, Qualcomm Ventures and more.
The company claims to have created the “world’s first digital chassis,” which goes beyond traditional shock absorbers and even driver-tunable suspension systems like those found in some high-end sports cars, allowing for vehicles that can monitor road conditions and adapt to them in real time, providing for optimal comfort and performance. ClearMotion says it achieves this through “proprietary algorithms,” which is a unique use of in-car smarts not related to autonomous driving or driver-assist features directly.
There is a way in which ClearMotion’s tech might be useful in a self-driving future, however: The company says its technology can help with the goal of making the in-cabin experience of riding in a self-driving whip much more enjoyable, and potentially more productive — you don’t want work in your mobile office interrupted by potholes, after all.
Good old-fashioned physical suspension has some advantages, like fewer bugs, but ClearMotion’s tech could indeed be a big help to a future where in-car stability is more important, since those spaces act more and more as extensions of our other living environs. Plus, no more spilling hot coffee all over my lap while trying to sip that sweet, sweet caffeine while driving.

548,Waymo’s self-driving tech got a lot better in 2016,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/01/waymos-self-driving-tech-got-a-lot-better-in-2016/,2017/02/01,"
Waymo’s self-driving software had far fewer disengagements in 2016 than it did in 2015 in the state of California, despite a big increase in the number of miles driven overall. The California Department of Motor Vehicles just published Waymo’s most recent disengagement report, which tracks al the times that a self-driving software system must be turned off in a test cars – and most of these aren’t even accidents or fender benders, but might actually entail a momentary pause to adjust something in software or quickly zap a bug.
This is huge news for Waymo in terms of its progress towards bringing a fully self-driving vehicle to customers via a production vehicle or ride-sharing service. Waymo’s self-driving technology lead Dmitri Dolgov explained why in a blog post celebrating the company’s progress, where he outlined that the tech actually achieved a four-fold improvement in its disengagement rate, as measured in the rate of episodes per 1,000 miles. The company register 0.80 disengagements (again, just times the self-driving software was turned off, not actual accidents) in 2015, versus only 0.20 in 2016.

Dolgov also notes that this is mostly achieved in city and suburban driving situations, too, which are most complex and which Waymo is focused on in order to make sure its technology can truly offer door-to-door service when it becomes available to the public. And while the disengagements might be few and far between, Dolgov also says that each one is crucial in terms of providing valuable learning for the system, with a rigorous process of building similar scenarios from which the learning software can benefit for each time the software has to be turned off. Waymo also tunes the system and its test engineers to err on the conservative side in terms of making the call to disengage, which makes the low rate for 2016 even more impressive.
Waymo CEO John Krafcik noted the four-fold improvement in disengagement performance when the company announced it wold be building its own sensors for its vehicles going forward, but it’s interesting to get a more complete picture, including the news that it recorded 124 total disengagements in 2016, vs. 341 in 2015, with 635,868 miles driven in total for 2016.

549,Chevrolet ends production of the Spark EV now that the Bolt EV is out,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/31/chevrolet-ends-production-of-the-spark-ev-now-that-the-bolt-ev-is-out/,2017/01/31,"
Chevrolet is putting its electrified bets on the Bolt EV, as the company announced today that it’s ending production of the Spark EV, the compact car with a relatively meager 82 miles of electric range. The decision to end production of the car likely has a lot to do with the Bolt EV’s much more attractive options, which include 238 miles of EPA rated range.
The price delta between the two cars likely would’ve made it hard for anyone interested in an electric vehicle to opt for the Spark EV, too – it started at just under $26,000, while the Bolt retails for $37,496 MSRP in the U.S., before the federal tax credit of $7,500 cuts that down to much closer. The Spark EV was only sold in three states, and Chevrolet told Detroit News that it sold only around 7,400 of them in total since its introduction in 2013.
Chevrolet’s Bolt EV is a much bigger bet on electric cars, but the company’s decision to part ways with the Spark EV shows it’s not interested in keeping EVs around just for the sake of having some in the lineup. Watching Bolt’s performance will be big not only for the future of Chevrolet’s electric car program, but for those of all automakers, since all eyes are on Chevrolet’s first attempt at a long-range, affordable consumer electric mass market vehicle.

Donald Trump’s pick for U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao received the confirmation of the full Senate on Tuesday. That’s the last hurdle for Chao, who now becomes the head of the Department of Transportation, replacing the outgoing Secretary Anthony Foxx, who was nominated by Barack Obama in 2013 and served until Trump’s inauguration on January 20.
Chao served as the Secretary of Labor under George W. Bush, and as Deputy Secretary of Transportation under George H.W. Bush, and was the least contentious of all of Trump’s nominees for cabinet positions, both in terms of support from the Senate and from industry leaders. Chao has been a popular pick among tech industry executives focused on transportation, owing to her signalled interest in enlisting more public-private partnerships in solving transportation problems, and in lessening regulatory barriers for private entities working in the space.
During her confirmation hearing before the Senate committee earlier this month, Chao was asked repeatedly about autonomous vehicle technology, drones and connected cars, and her answers always centered around strong national leadership for these areas of development, working in close partnership with industry so as to avoid stifling “innovation and creativity” through overly burdensome regulatory frameworks.
The Self-Driving Coalition, an industry group made up of OEMs including Ford, Lyft, Waymo, Volvo and Uber sent a note to TechCrunch immediately upon her confirmation congratulating Secretary Chao, which should help provide some indication of industry’s excitement about her selection. The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI), an industry organization with works with the DoT and FAA on establishing favorable drone development policy, likewise sent through a message of congratulations.
At her confirmation vote Tuesday, Chao, who is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), easily had one of the most agreeable confirmation hearings of this round of cabinet appointments. Chao cleared the 60-vote threshold easily, with a final tally of 93 for and 6 against, but did face protest votes from Democratic Senators including Cory Booker (D-NJ), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).

551,Researchers teach cars to work together with or without drivers via Wi-Fi,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/31/researchers-teach-cars-to-work-together-with-or-without-drivers-via-wi-fi/,2017/01/31,"
Academics from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) have created a working system that allows vehicles to drive autonomously at highway speeds, while navigating multi-lane traffic in real-world settings, using wireless communication based on basic Wi-Fi standards. The study was meant to show how communication between vehicles enabled by tech built-in to most modern cars, when combined with sensor systems also included on modern vehicles, can work together to provide advanced self-driving capabilities and enhance passenger safety in both driver and driverless cars.
The idea is that the cars can work as collaborative platoons, perhaps guided by a single or a few human-controlled vehicles. This is a practice already in service in some tests, with convoys of autonomous trucks playing a fairly rigorous game of “follow the leader” based on established pre-set rules. But the EPFL researches came up with something more flexible, in which cars communicate continually with those around them in close proximity, adapting on the fly so that they aren’t solely reliant on one centralized leader or control center. This allows them to handle variances in traffic, and to add or subtract members from the convoy as needed.

The benefits of this system include access to as many sets of virtual “eyes” as there are vehicles with sensors in the array, and the researchers say there’ also no upwards limit in terms of how large the group can grow. So far, the real-world demonstration has been limited to only a network of three cars, but it still represented a successful proof of concept, paving the way for larger trials to follow.
Car makers including Honda, which debuted its “safe swarm” concept at CES this year, are already interested in how connected vehicles might be able to work together to more effectively navigate roads and traffic, both with people behind the wheel and without, so expect to see a lot more funding and research focused on this area in the future.

552,Daimler to operate self-driving cars on Uber’s network,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/31/daimler-will-build-self-driving-cars-for-uber/,2017/01/31,"
Daimler and Uber have announced a partnership that will see the automaker introduce its own self-driving cars for use on Uber’s ride sharing service. The team-up is the second alliance Uber has struck with a car maker in pursuit of its goal of delivering self-driving service to users, the first of which was struck with Volvo and resulted in the XC90 self-driving test car that serves as Uber’s latest prototype.
This is different from Uber’s arrangement with Volvo, however, in that Daimler will own and operate its vehicles itself, while taking advantage of Uber’s technology and ride-sharing network services. Uber tells TechCrunch this is the first time it’s announcing its role as an “open self-driving vehicle platform,” wherein car makers can bring their own vehicles to the network to operate them. It’s a little like what Tesla intends to offer for drivers of its own cars, but targeted at automaker fleets and open to all car makers.
In a blog post announcing the news, Uber CEO and founder Travis Kalanick noted that his company realized early that the potential of self-driving cars in terms of safety is huge, but that it wouldn’t be able to do everything itself, which has resulted in its decision to seek out automaker partners like Daimler.
Kalanick points out a debate between himself and Daimler Chairman Dr. Dieter Zetsche that occurred during a Future of Transportation talk hosted by publisher Axel Springer in Berlin last year (embedded below) in his announcement, noting that while the two disagreed in some respects, he was “personally impressed” with the German carmaker.

This is a big announcement, and a significant change in strategy for Uber from its work with Volvo, which involved co-development of autonomous driving tech and vehicles operated by Uber itself. Effectively Uber is going to be offering a way for OEMs to provide ride sharing services without having to build or acquire their own network or service offering to do so, as companies including Ford, GM and others are currently attempting to do.
Even if many automakers continue to pursue the creation of their own ride-sharing services with autonomous vehicles, it’s likely Uber will remain an attractive third-party option for them to explore. It’s a smart move that emphasizes Uber’s expertise and advantages in demand prediction and routing, while downplaying the areas where it would be hard pressed to excel, including in automotive manufacturing.
Like many automakers, Daimler has stated that it aims to launch a self-driving car by 2020, so that’s the earliest we’re likely to see this partnership actually result in vehicles on the road, barring any earlier prototype testing.

553,Arkamys creates space-age safety sounds for EVs,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/30/arkamys-creates-space-age-safety-sounds-for-evs/,2017/01/30,"
In 2014, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration established the very cool-sounding “Minimum Sound Requirements for Hybrid and Electric Vehicles,” which does exactly what it says. It requires that 100 percent of all EVs and hybrids make some noise at low speeds by 2019. If a vehicle can move forward or in reverse without engaging an internal combustion engine, it needs to make some kind of noise that blind and visually impaired pedestrians can identify as coming from a moving vehicle.
French company Arkamys tunes automotive audio for car interiors, whether that’s optimizing a sound system or making the speech functions of in-car electronics more intelligible. Now it has partnered with South Korean automotive hardware supplier MHE to create the sounds required by the NHTSA (and its European counterpart) to let pedestrians know there’s an EV creeping up on them.
The system, which will be ready for mass production in 2017, uses small, lightweight, but tough speakers mounted behind the bumpers and connected to the car’s electronics. The system receives speed information so that it can start making sound when the vehicle is traveling 25 mph or less. (NHTSA requires it to engage at 18 mph or less.) As the car speeds up or slows down, the pitch changes appropriately. And if the car is in reverse, the sound is slightly different so pedestrians know that too.
The Arkamys/MHE system works with the vehicle’s pedestrian sensors, if it has them, to emit sound from the speaker closest to the pedestrian. The sound is transmitted inside the car too, with the relevant speaker making a noise to let the driver know to look out for a pedestrian.
Arkamys/MHE is supplying the system directly to manufacturers, so you can’t bolt it on as an aftermarket upgrade. But Arkamys is using its expertise in audio tuning and customizing to create branded sounds for auto makers. It can create spacey, Jetsons-like sounds, engine-like revs, a neutral whir or anything that fits the car and meets the requirements.
You might wonder why 18 mph is the magic number. NHTSA found that to be the “crossover speed” — any faster than that and even an EV makes enough tire and wind noise to be noticeable. Less than 18 mph (30 kph), though, and EVs are silent, sneaky little things.

Ford CEO Mark Fields and Executive Chairman Bill Ford have released a statement on Donald Trump’s immigration order, making them the first major U.S. automaker to offer an official comment or position. The statement reads as follows, and was shared internally with Ford employees as well as made available to the press:
Respect for all people is a core value of Ford Motor Company, and we are proud of the rich diversity of our company here at home and around the world. That is why we do not support this policy or any other that goes against our values as a company. We are not aware, to date, of any Ford employees directly affected by this policy. We will continue working to ensure the well-being of our employees by promoting the values of respect and inclusion in the workplace.
This is a significant break with Trump’s White House for both Fields and Executive Chairman Ford, who have been supportive of Trump in comments in the past. Fields is a member of Trump’s manufacturing council, and met with him at the White House on multiple occasions, including alongside other U.S. automotive company executives and with Tesla CEO and founder Elon Musk. Bill Ford called Trump “accessible” and “very easy to talk to” in an interview from earlier this month, noting he speaks to Trump “frequently.”

Automakers GM and Honda are teaming up on a new venture to jointly manufacture hydrogen fuel cells at scale, with plans to start mass production by 2020 and a combined investment of $85 million split evenly between the two companies dedicated to the effort. Both GM and Honda intend to use the resulting hydrogen fuel cell system in future products, according to the companies.
The joint venture, which will be called Fuel Cell System Manufacturing, LLC, will build the fuel cells at GM’s existing Brownstown, Michigan-based battery pack construction facility, where it currently assembles battery packs for its Volt and Bolt EVs.
GM has been working on hydrogen fuel cell technology for quite some time across a number of industries. It’s working with the U.S. Navy on a fuel-cell powered submarine drone, for instance, and it’s also been developing a Colorado ZH2 test truck for the U.S. Army with a fuel cell powertrain that has a lot of flexibility when it comes to mission-based use.
Overall, the company has invested around $3 billion in development of fuel-cell tech, and is looking to field a fuel cell vehicle for consumers as soon as 2020. GM announced a partnership with Honda to develop production fuel cell technology back in 2013, and their timelines were remarkably similar to the one announced today. The companies also revealed their new, much smaller and more compact fuel cell design.
Dan Nicholson, VP of Global Propulsion Systems at General Motors said at a press conference announcing the joint venture that “we can safely say that today’s announcement officially marks the arrival of fuel cells.”

Honda has a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle available already, in the FCX Clarity. The sedan will be joined by two other models, a fully electric and a plug-in hybrid, later this year.
By combining their efforts, Honda and GM are hoping to help drive manufacturing costs lower, faster. Demand for fuel cell systems across both automakers will help boost scale, and since the two are collaborating on sourcing, they’ll be able to achieve better prices for components from suppliers, too.
Fuel cell technology has significant advantages in terms of range and efficiency vs. both traditional fossil fuel vehicles and purely electric options, with advantages when it comes to refuelling times vs. electric charge.

556,Car2go’s North American fleet will be mostly Mercedes-Benz by the end of 2017,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/30/car2gos-north-american-fleet-will-be-mostly-mercedes-benz-by-the-end-of-2017/,2017/01/30,"
Car2go is making a significant change to its car-sharing operation in North America, which will see its fleet of short-term rental vehicles made up of mostly Mercedes-Benz vehicles by the end of this year. The company is rolling out 2017 Mercedes-Benz CLA and GLAs in cities including Austin, Portland, Seattle, Toronto, Vancouver and Washington, D.C. to begin with, with plans to expand to more of its North American markets throughout the year.
The Daimler-owned car2go offers mostly Smart fortwo cars currently, with a few Mercedes-Benz B-Class vehicles also available in Calgary, Toronto and Vancouver, a measure car2go says was actually a pilot to see if there was enough demand for this broader rollout of Mercedes-Benz model options. The news that the fleet will be made up mostly of Mercedes vehicles by the end of the year means that makeup is set to change considerably – especially given that car2go has already been rolling out new model fortwos across the U.S. and Canada.
Expansion to these four and five-door vehicles is designed to help increase the appeal of the service to families and groups living in cities, who aren’t well served by compact Smart vehicles and the B-Class, the smallest car in the Mercedes lineup. This is also the only way to access Mercedes-Benz vehicles via one-way car sharing services in North America, the company points out, which should help the service appeal to an entirely new category of user.
All the Mercedes-Benz vehicles will offer CarPlay and Android Auto, rear-view cameras, adaptive braking, blind spot assistance, SiriusXM and more. The cars will cost more to rent than the fortwo vehicles, as you might expect, but car2go points out that they’re “still quite affordable,” according to a press release. Car2go members will also get discounts on new Mercedes-Benz and Smart vehicles in 2017, which will range from between $500 and $4,500 off the final purchase price depending on model and dealer.
This could be a big step toward helping car2go become even more competitive with Zipcar and other similar services, and offer a way for Daimler to compete with other high-end alternatives to vehicle ownership like the Book pilot project by Cadillac, and Audi’s on demand short-term rental service.

557,"Not just Uber, now Grab is also hiring government insiders to grow its business",https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/30/grab-hires-former-indonesian-national-police-chief/,2017/01/30,"
Southeast Asia’s Grab is taking a leaf out of the Uber playbook and bringing in a prominent insider to get ahead in its most important market.
Uber popularized the approach of nabbing execs like ex-Obama advisor David Plouffe and various others, and that’s the thesis behind ride-sharing firm Grab’s latest hire: the former chief of Indonesia’s National Police.
Badrodin Haiti, who spent a total of 35 years in the force, has joined Grab to take up the role of President Commissioner in Indonesia. That’ll see him manage the firm’s corporate governance in its largest market.
Five-year-old Grab, which is valued at $3 billion following a $750 million round last year, is pushing Uber hard in Southeast Asia, where it claims to have 580,000 drivers and over 30 million app downloads across six countries. Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy and the world’s fourth most populous country with 250 million inhabitants, is a key battleground where both companies, and $1.3 billion-valued local startup GoJek, are duking it out.
Aside from a rivalry than encompasses more than just taxis — the three firms specialize in motorbikes, services like shopping, and offer digital payment apps — regulatory hurdles are an important part of the challenge there.
The Indonesian government laid out regulations for ride-hailing services last year, which place restrictions on the types of cars in service and a ban on so-called independent drivers, but motorbike taxis remain unregulated. Grab evidently feels there’s plenty to gain from bringing an insider onto its team as it looks to expand its focus to more of the country.
It said Haiti will “oversee and ensure Grab Indonesia’s corporate governance and long-term sustainability in a supervisory role over Grab’s board of directors.”
Haitu, who has experience running the police in four Indonesian provinces and had stints as chief and deputy chief of the national force, believes Grab’s “values closely match” his own.
“I am delighted to join Grab Indonesia, a mission-oriented organization with a track record of improving lives in Indonesia and solving local problems,” he said in a statement. “I will ensure that Grab continues to be a shining example of corporate accountability and citizenship.”
“Mr. Haiti will play a guiding role to ensure Grab contributes constructively to the implementation of new transport regulations and safety guidelines,” added Grab Indonesia MD Ridzki Kramadibrata.

558,Ohio’s Transportation Research Center gets $45M to expand smart mobility testing,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/27/ohios-transportation-research-center-gets-45m-to-expand-smart-mobility-testing/,2017/01/27,"
Ohio’s Transportation Research Center (TRC) is getting a new 540-acre facility specifically for testing and researching smart mobility solutions, with on-site plans for a 12-lane intersection and reconfigurable test platform wider than 50 highway lines and as long as 10 football fields. That comes courtesy of a new $45 million grant from Ohio State University, Ohio state funds and Jobs Ohio.
The new facility will be able to simulate conditions in urban, rural and suburban settings, including the ability to simulate traffic, car crashes, different network connectivity and smart infrastructure and more.
The Ohio testing facility is billed as the “largest independent test facility and proving grounds in North America,” though it wasn’t on the list of 10 official Proving Grounds named by the U.S. Department of Transportation earlier this month. Still, the TRC boasts 4,500 total acres of testing facilities, and is seeking additional funding to help it complete phases two and three of its Smart Mobility Advanced Research and Test Center, which will include a full highway loop, as well as an indoor testing facility protected from winter climate conditions.
TRC is located in the Columbus area, which is also seeking to create a corridor for smart mobility testing on public roads in the state in partnership with Dublin, Marysville and Union County. Honda also houses the majority of its North American operations in the area, which helps it maintain strong ties to industry.
Proving grounds like this one are very much a target for funding from academic, private and public funds at the moment, as the car industry looks to explore new revenue models, and cities try to anticipate the transportation demands of future urban centres, for which congestion is an increasing problem.

559,Daimler close to buying Taxibeat in Greece for around $43M,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/27/daimler-close-to-buying-taxibeat-in-greece-for-around-43m/,2017/01/27,"
Automakers are continuing to ramp up their holdings in the world of on-demand transportation services, and in the latest development, Germany’s Daimler is closing in on a deal to acquire Taxibeat, a profitable ride-hailing app based out of Athens, for a price of around €40 million ($43 million).
The deal — which would roll Taxibeat into the same Daimler division that includes MyTaxi and Hailo, was originally reported in the Greek-language financial publication Naftenporiki. Daimler, which also owns Mercedes Benz and a number of other brands, declined to comment for this story, but we have confirmed that the deal is progressing with sources close to the automaker. The acquisition sounds like it will close soon.
Taxibeat had raised under $7 million, according to Crunchbase, representing a good return for its investors, which include Hummingbird Ventures and Openfund.
Unlike some of the other services that connect riders with drivers in the back end before presenting you with your ride, Taxibeat’s app presents cars in a marketplace format, where you have the option to take a ride from a driver selected by Taxibeat, or select a driver based on user ratings and other factors like whether the car has WiFi.
Taxibeat is one example of a counter-theme in the world on-demand transportation.
While Uber has spent a lot of money expanding internationally and making itself nearly ubiquitous across the world’s cities (it’s now in 540 of them globally), there are a large number of competitors that have built businesses focusing on a much smaller number of markets, where they are giving Uber and other incumbents a run for their money.
Taxibeat, according to the report in the Greek newspaper, is seeing an annual growth rate of about 180%, has some 850,000 customers in Athens, and it is profitable.
That is on the back of Taxibeat being active only in two markets: its home market of Greece, where there are 7,000 drivers in Athens on its network, making it one of the leading providers in that city; and in Peru, where there are 15,000 drivers and 800,000 customers.
All the same, we’re also in a period of some consolidation in this area of tech, in part because there is an economy of scale involved in building these services out, and in order to expand a business, it’s not clear if any single pure-play ride hailing company would be able to raise anything like the multiple billions that Uber has now raised  in funding (only Didi and Lyft come close, but even they are a far cry away).
There have been a lot of recent moves by car makers to step into ride-hailing services — made popular by the rise of companies like Uber — either by taking investments in these businesses or buying them outright.
This is part of a strategy to hedge their bets in a future where people may not own cars outright, but may instead rent cars when they need them, or just ride in cars operated by others. Earlier this month, Renault acquired another car service, Karhoo in the UK. Last year, VW invested $300 million in Gett, GM put $500 million in Lyft, and Ford acquired the Chariot shuttle service.
Daimler is actually one of the earlier movers on this front. It took its first stake in MyTaxi in early 2012. It eventually acquired it, and RideScout, in 2014. Last year, Daimler also took a majority stake in UK’s Hailo.
Some of these deals are about getting into a business as it is growing and before it becomes a potential rival — GM’s $500 million investment boosted Lyft’s valuation to $5.5 billion.
And some are aimed at getting a distressed asset at a low price with the aim of recapitalising, restructuring and hopefully making it into a viable business: Renault’s acquisition of London-based Karhoo was for only $1 million, plus a $15 million commitment for investment — purchasing the startup from its administrators when it couldn’t pay the bills after it ran out of VC money (documents shared with us by sources noted it had raised around $52 million, not the $250 million that was claimed).
We have also contacted Taxibeat with a request for comment and will update this story as we learn more.

Donald Trump’s White House administration has revealed the full membership of its manufacturing council (via Steve Kopack), which he assigned Dow Chemical CEO Andrew Liveris to lead in December. The council includes Elon Musk, making this the second Trump administration advisory group that the Tesla CEO belongs to, including his Strategic and Policy Forum, which advises on economic matters.
Musk isn’t the only tech executive on the manufacturing council, however. Other members include Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, Dell CEO and founder Michael Dell, and Ford CEO Michael Fields. Dennis Muilenburg from Boeing, Wendell Weeks from Corning, Jeff Immelt from General Electric and Marillyn Hewson from Lockheed Martin are also council members.
Of the tech industry people on this list, Musk has perhaps been the most vocal and visible in his involvement with Trump administration activities. Musk tweeted his optimism around Trump Secretary of State pick Rex Tillerson earlier this week, and spoke to Gizmodo about his support of the oil industry executive. Though Tillerson supported a carbon tax on record at ExxonMobil, a measure Musk also supports for encouraging development of renewables, a report this week revealed that the Secretary of State pick’s former company also actively lobbied against a carbon tax in Massachusetts. Musk also met with Trump on Monday, in a meeting where Ford’s Mark Fields was also present.
Fields has been among the most enthusiastic and vocal with regards to Trump on the auto industry side. Following a meeting earlier this week which also included GM CEO Mary Barra and FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne, Fields said he was “excited” about working with Trump and his administration. At an interview at Davos this week, Michael Dell said that his company was encouraged by an administration talking about policies that are “pro-growth.”
Here’s the full list of members on the new manufacturing council:

Andrew Liveris, The Dow Chemical Company
Bill Brown, Harris Corporation
Michael Dell, Dell Technologies
John Ferriola, Nucor Corporation
Jeff Fettig, Whirlpool Corporation
Mark Fields, Ford Motor Company
Ken Frazier, Merck & Co., Inc.

561,This startup wants to make China’s electric scooters as desirable as iPhones,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/27/niu-china-electric-scooter/,2017/01/27,"
Editor’s note: This post originally appeared on TechNode, an editorial partner of TechCrunch based in China.
China is a big country with big cities and big roads. Imagine what it must feel like to know that the closest subway station or bus stop is 20-30 minutes away. Imagine getting in your car at 2 pm on a Thursday thinking that the traffic should be okay only to find that traffic definitely isn’t okay. Imagine taking a cab to the nearest supermarket because it would take 30 minutes to walk there.
Welcome to the life of over half the Chinese population.
The last 6 km problem
Usually, when we talk about the last mile problem, we’re referring to connectivity or logistics, i.e. how does an ISP ensure efficient investments to few people? However, for transportation in China, it’s the last 6 kilometers that’s the real problem. That’s exactly the problem that Token Hu, co-founder and head of product at Niu (pronounced “new”), set out to solve.
“The goal we set for ourselves was to find the solution to the problem of city traffic. After a lot of research about the situation in China, US, and Europe, we don’t think electric cars can solve the problem. There are enough cars on the road already,” he said in an interview.
“We thought about the last mile problem when we first started thinking about the product, but when we were doing our research, we found it’s not only the last mile. Every day people travel to work, meetings, grab a coffee, or meet friends, the average distance is 3-6 kilometers. Everyone does about that distance. So we asked ourselves, what kind of vehicle can conveniently travel that distance?” Hu added.
The answer, as we now know, was e-scooters.
However, the company was about to enter into an already saturated market: 20-30 million e-scooters and e-bikes are sold each year for a total of more than 200 million. These bikes, though, are relatively cheap to make and buy; the most expensive and inconvenient part is the battery, traditionally a heavy lead-acid block weighing anywhere between 20 to 50 kilograms depending on power and capacity.

Token Hu at the Niu’s launch event in 2015
The three biggest problems
Looking at Hu’s industrial and graphic design background, one might easily assume that the first problem they would look to solve would be the most obvious and visible: the look and feel. Niu, however, came from a different angle.
“The first major problem we wanted to solve was the battery mobility problem. We wanted to make something that was removable, light, and small,” Hu explained. “A major reason people don’t buy an e-scooter is the battery. Removable, small, and really efficient was the first problem we tried to solve.”
So, they created a lightweight, but powerful, lithium-ion battery. However, as anyone who has spent any time in China knows, a bane for any bike or scooter rider (electric or no) is theft. Theft of the battery, theft of the vehicle, and sometimes just theft of parts.
The best method of prevention is the most obvious one: make it hard to steal. There are a few different ways to do that: you can add more locks or you could do what the car and mobile phone industry have done.
“Before Niu, every e-scooter company uses different suppliers for the batteries, motor, controller, dashboard, different parts,” Hu said. “There’s no operating system. We want to make the whole system communicate with each other and communicate with our cloud services. Every time you change a piece, our servers will know.”

The company’s full-size model
Only after the company solved those two fundamental problems, did it begin to consider the scooter’s look and feel. As China’s economy is developing, consumers are beginning to expect more, according to a McKinsey report, and there’s increasing evidence that they are willing to pay for it, too. That’s the market they targeted.
“Why are people buying a 2,500 RMB ($350) bike? Because they have no other choice. The older people are buying the older generation of products, the young generation doesn’t want to buy that stuff because it doesn’t fit their philosophy. It doesn’t fit their beliefs. It doesn’t fit with their style,” Hu explained. “People like us, we use iPhone or Xiaomi. We want things that are simple, elegant, friendly.”
The strategy seems to be working.
Crowdfunding pre-sales campaigns for Niu’s first full-sized e-scooter and mini e-scooter have been major successes: 72,022,526 RMB and 81,380,425 RMB, respectively — that’s around $10.5 million and $11.75 million.
Even with prices that are 40-130 percent higher (3399 to 6899 RMB), sales are growing along with its fanbase. To date, Niu has sold over 90,000 units of its latest full-sized model, the N1S, and 60,000 units of the M1.

562,Ford’s new SmartLink OBD accessory adds connected features to older cars,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/26/fords-new-smartlink-odb-accessory-adds-connected-features-to-older-cars/,2017/01/26,"
Connectivity features are increasingly included as standard on new vehicles, with cellular modems in particular becoming a popular feature included even in base level trim. Now, connectivity is so important to Ford, that the automaker is actually offering an easy retrofit option to add connected features to Ford and Lincoln vehicles from model years between 2010 and 2016, with SmartLink, a new piece of hardware that drivers can just plug into their car’s OBD II port.
The SmartLink includes a 4G LTE modem on board, letting it act as a Wi-Fi hotspot for up to 8 devices in the vehicle. It also enables remote start, lock and unlock functions, and can send alerts to a car owner via a companion web and mobile app to let them check on car healthy, and get alerts related to security and service requirements.
“We’ve seen the huge interest that we’ve had in SYNC, and now in the modems that we have in our vehicles, and we just talked to a lot of customers and they’re very happy with their current vehicles, but they obviously wanted to have some of the latest connectivity features, too.” said Brett Wheatley, Executive Director of Ford’s Customer Service Division in an interview. “We’ve been doing research for many years on it and we just wanted to make sure that we had the right product that would meet all of our security requirements.”
Wheatley says that in the course of developing SmartLink and looking at customer feedback, they also found that users wanted different things from a connected car, with some seeking security via theft alerts, others looking for more insight into maintenance issues, and others just wanting ways to offer connectivity for their family devices on the road. SmartLink is a way to address the most frequent requests in terms of connectivity use cases for Ford vehicle owners.
SmartLink isn’t the same as Ford’s SYNC 3 in-car infotainment system, which offers more in the way of integration with third-party apps and services, but it does offer some neat tricks via the companion app, including the ability to set geofences and speed limits. That could be very useful for parents of teens borrowing the family car, since the app can receive alerts if it a car with SmartLink installed goes beyond set boundaries or above specific speeds. It can also track driving habits over time, and suggest ways to be a better driver.
Older cars like this 2014 Lincoln MKX will be able to quickly add 4G and app-based features with the SmartLink.
SmartLink is currently undergoing pilot trials at a few dealers in the U.S., and will be available broadly in the U.S. through dealerships this summer, with final pricing to be announced at that time. SmartLink is definitely an opportunity for dealers, since it gives them a way to potentially enjoy a more profitable post-purchase relationship with customers.
“We think it’s a great opportunity for our dealers to stay connected after the time of purchase, to make sure that they’re in regular contact with that customer, keeping their vehicle in great working condition,” Wheatley told me.
In fact, connected vehicles represent huge potential revenue gains over non-connected cars, according to a recent survey of auto industry executives by KPMG. A car with connectivity built-in could offer up about 10 times the revenue streams as one without, which is a big reason to help bring even older vehicles into the mix. I asked Wheatley whether SmartLink might support third-party apps and services eventually, as Ford has done with SYNC 3 in its newer models.
“We’ve definitely done that in our new vehicles, so I think that is an opportunity for down the road, to see how we could give the customers in those older vehicles all the great technology that’s in our new vehicles, and all the connectivity features and benefits they have,” he said.
SmartLink was developed in partnership with Delphi Automotive and Verizon Telematics (disclosure: Verizon owns Aol which owns TechCrunch) and has undergone two years of security and user experience testing to get to this point. It’s a smart move on Ford’s part to both address customer needs and open up new revenue potential, and yet another sign that connectivity is king these days in the automotive world.

563,"Tesla sues ex-Autopilot director for taking proprietary info, poaching employees",https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/26/tesla-sues-ex-autopilot-director-for-taking-proprietary-info-poaching-employees/,2017/01/26,"
Tesla has sued former employee Sterling Anderson, who acted as Director of its Autopilot Programs for just over a year, for breach of contract. The suit accuses Anderson of having tried to recruit away employees from Tesla, with the intent of starting his own autonomous driving company, and of also taking Tesla proprietary confidential information to support this goal.
Tesla alleges in its complaint that Anderson and recently departed head of Google’s self-driving project Chris Urmson (also named as a defendant) were going to use the information and personnel taken from Tesla to begin their own self-driving car company, dubbed Aurora, with the aim of charting a similar path to companies including Cruise Automation and Otto, both of which went on to enjoy lucrative exits.
In the suit, Tesla also alleges that Anderson downloaded “hundreds of gigabytes” of proprietary data from his work computer to a personal storage device, and that he then manually hacked the timestamps on files to hide evidence of his acquisition of the information. He also wiped the iPhone issued by Tesla, the suit says, in order to erase evidence of his attempts to poach fellow employees. These attempts were met with only limited success, however, as only two employees apparently ever jumped ship to the new venture.
Tesla is seeking damages for its losses as a result of its breaches suffered due to Anderson’s actions, as well as punitive damages for what it terms “malicious” acts on Anderson’s behalf. It’s also looking for injunctions against Aurora’s technologies pending Tesla’s vetting for use of its proprietary tech.
The suit was filed Thursday morning at the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara and seeks a jury trial to resolve the matter.
Tesla declined to provide comment when contacted.
Aurora provided the following statement to TechCrunch via email when asked for more information:
Tesla’s meritless lawsuit reveals both a startling paranoia and an unhealthy fear of competition. This abuse of the legal system is a malicious attempt to stifle a competitor and destroy personal reputations. Aurora looks forward to disproving these false allegations in court and to building a successful self-driving business.

564,GM’s new SDK for in-car infotainment apps offers access to nearly 400 data points,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/26/gms-new-sdk-for-in-car-infotainment-apps-offers-access-to-nearly-400-data-points/,2017/01/26,"
GM is opening up to app makers in a way that’s unique among carmakers; it created a software development kit for those looking to build apps for its in-car infotainment system that exposes 400 data points from the car itself for developer use. The SDK allows creation of apps using HTML5 and JavaScript, running off of Node.js, that many front-end web developers already know, and GM’s Ed Wrenbeck, director of Application Ecosystem and Development, tells me this should make it possible for developers to create apps ready for testing in as little as a week.
“Historically, the automakers haven’t made it very easy for partners to really utilize the connected vehicle experience,” Wrenbeck explained. “So we set out about seven months ago, as part of our API platform to really fix that and make it very easy for the corporate community to exploit the connected vehicle experience.”
The old, difficult way of developing apps for GM cars.
This is a big change in how GM works with developers. Previously, anyone looking to put software on its infotainment displays in-vehicle would have to actually make the trip down to Michigan to test and debug their applications, using the console you see above to get an idea of how it would actually work for a user in a vehicle.
Now, the so-called “next generation infotainment software development kit” (NGI SDK for short) enables a fully virtual app-building process on any computer, with little hassle and no real new coding skills to learn for experienced front-end devs. It virtualizes the in-car experience, including mock live driving data, to make it easy to build and test apps without a plane ticket to Detroit.
The new way to build apps for GM vehicles.
It can simulate all the data that would be available to developers in a real car, including things like trip odometer, current speed, window open/closed state, backup camera and more. As mentioned, GM is offering up access to around 400 of these, which compares to less than 50 in the competing automaker SDK with the next highest number of available data points, according to GM.
“If you were somebody like a map provider, for example, you could actually read the suspension data coming off the vehicle and use it to determine where potholes were at in the street, for example,” Wrenbeck said, by way of illustrating how third-parties might employ the available data feeds. “Just one example of some of the unusual ways that you can use data that GM provides uniquely, that other OEMs just don’t provide via their infotainment systems.”
At a recent hackathon, GM also used actual Corvettes as game controllers, feeding real-time steering and acceleration data to control on-screen cars in a video game built on the infotainment SDK. “We had $160,000 worth of controllers,” Wrenbeck jokes.

The list of data points is too long to share in its entirety here, but it also includes things like shift mode status and shift lever position, cruise control info, outside air temperature, trailer light status, road type and speed limit, EV current max and min range, and much more.
GM will be reviewing apps prior to making them available to end users, but the SDK does offer a one-click submission process to compress your software and send it for testing and review. Wrenbeck said it’s probably going to take a few weeks, perhaps even three or four, for turnaround on submitted applications, but even getting it that low has required a lot of optimization on the GM side. Wrenbeck said they’ll also be prioritizing partners they’re eager to work with early on, so it’s not quite as wide open as the App Store application process, for instance.
Still, it sounds like a big improvement over how third-parties have pursued access to infotainment systems in the past. It also could be easier than getting an app on Apple’s CarPlay, for instance, which is still a closed system where Apple does very careful, and very limited selection of partners.
Currently, it’s working with IBM on Watson integration, and AT&T, and GM says a number of other partners are also interested in working with the SDK already. The automaker is also hosting a number of upcoming hackathons to get the SDK in front of more people, including at an event in Florida coming up later in February.

565,"P2P car marketplace Shift pauses DC operations, lays off 10% of staff",https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/25/p2p-car-marketplace-shift-pauses-dc-operations-lays-off-10-of-staff/,2017/01/25,"
After Beepi shut down its service and transferred its operations to stealth Fair.com, its closest competitor Shift is facing some downsizing, too — a measure of the challenges of the peer-to-peer car selling business model that both had been trying to establish.
TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that Shift has laid off just under 10 percent of all its staff, or 25 people, and it has also temporarily “paused” operations in the Washington, DC, region while it works on getting a dealer license to fill out a new role as a reseller for car rental giant Hertz. Part of the layoffs are due to the company transferring to more of an inside sales model, where there may be more time given to progressing sales remotely instead of in-person: one of Shift’s unique selling points has been its in-person test drives.
Existing operations in Los Angeles and San Francisco are not being affected by the closure in DC. (Other markets listed on Shift.com for Orange County, San Diego and Sacramento do not appear to be actively selling yet).
In December, Shift — which has raised $74 million from investors such as Goldman Sachs, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, and Highland Capital Partners — announced a strategic partnership with car rental company Hertz. Under the deal, Shift will sell cars from Hertz’s inventory on its platform.
“Over the past five years, Hertz has implemented a robust retail car sales strategy and become a prominent retail used car seller in the U.S.,” said Jeff Adams, VP, vehicle remarketing at Hertz, in a statement. “We are excited to partner with innovative companies like Shift to leverage their technology and bring a seamless, hassle-free purchase experience to our car buyers.”
Shift said the transition to Hertz’s inventory as a supplement to the P2P model is related to the decision to cut staff in existing markets.
“We made a decision to make some changes to our employment model, which has resulted in some staff reductions,” said a spokesperson. The Hertz sales agreement was piloted in Los Angeles and San Francisco, and Minnie Ingersoll, Shift’s COO, said that the plan will be to have up to 20% of all inventory on Shift.com come from Hertz, with the rest from P2P.
The Hertz deal will also be used as a way to cut costs in how Shift expands.
“Moving forward, we are going to launch markets with Hertz inventory before we start P2P,” a spokesperson said “One of the most expensive parts of launching a new market is acquiring cars, so this partnership is honestly a game changer for us. We’ll have access to instant inventory and be able to scale more quickly and economically.”
When Beepi hit the rocks, Shift found itself in a position as a potential buyer of the company, according to an internal memo put out by CEO George Arison after Beepi’s situation became public. But he also claimed that Beepi’s loss was Shift.com’s win, with Shift’s conversions on Google ads going up and customer acquisition costs dropping as Beepi wound down. (No surprise, as there was less competition in the market.)
But even with the Hertz deal in hand, it seems, there were still more changes to come to bring costs down. Up to now, Shift has provided a platform to get a price estimate for the car you want to sell, getting that car completely inspected by a Shift mechanic, and then selling it; or, on the other side, finding a car you want to buy, and getting that car delivered to you for a test drive; with Shift handling the paperwork and potentially financing for the whole process.
Now there will be a move to bringing down some costs by transferring some of this work to an inside sales model, “Buyer Inside Sales” in Shift’s words. This will mean less in-person time, which works out to lower costs for the whole sale. It’s a change that “required different type of labor and less labor,” Shift’s CEO George Arison wrote me in an email.
Shift believes that the Hertz deal and the fundamentals of what Shift is providing are more sound longer term and do not compare with Beepi’s rise and subsequent fall.
“Beepi’s model was actually the model that I first came up with in 2012,” Arison said. “But after that I spent a year learning about the auto market, and realized that if you do not have a local business model, you cannot be successful (because people do not buy cars nationally). We then refined our vision for Shift (before launching the company) to be much more local (with test drive delivery), which had little in common with our old model or Beepi’s model. It took Beepi $150M and three years to figure this out… Their business model was fundamentally different than ours and simply not working (as we figured out before we spent any capital).”

566,Driving the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/driving-the-2017-chevrolet-bolt-ev/,2017/01/24,CONTENT ERROR
567,Elon Musk actually believes Rex Tillerson could be an “excellent” Secretary of State,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/elon-musk-actually-believes-rex-tillerson-could-be-an-excellent-secretary-of-state/,2017/01/24,"
Tesla and SpaceX CEO met with Donald Trump on Monday, and just a day later, he’s expressing optimism about Trump’s choice for Secretary of State, former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson.
On the surface, you’d be forgiven for assuming that Tillerson as Secretary of State would be at odds with Musk’s worldview, given the former’s 40+ years of service at a company that produces fossil fuels as its primary business. But Musk replied to an Economics post outlining reasons Tillerson might not be such a bad choice to lead U.S. foreign policy decision-making under Trump.


@TheEconomist This may sound surprising coming from me, but I agree with The Economist. Rex Tillerson has the potential to be an excellent Sec of State.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 24, 2017



Musk also replied to requests from followers to shed light on why, exactly, he would hold such a counterintuitive opinion regarding Tillerson’s selection. The Tesla founder called Tillerson “exceptionally competent,” referring specifically to his tenure at Exxon, and also praised his understanding of global politics. He added in a separate tweet that he believes Tillerson deserves “the benefit of the doubt” pending actions that would contradict that optimism.


@danahull Rex is an exceptionally competent executive, understands geopolitics and knows how to win for his team. His team is now the USA.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 24, 2017



Tillerson has supported a carbon tax previously in his role leading CEO as the most effective way to control industrial impact on climate change, but his former company is under investigation by the state of New York for potentially misleading the public regarding climate change’s effects. In the end, critics suggest Tillerson’s prior acknowledgement of climate change as a problem and proposed solutions were more about alleviating criticism levied against ExxonMobil, and less about effecting real change.
The proposed Secretary of State, who moved one step closer to becoming confirmed in his role, also has close ties to Russia, including a deal made in 2011 in which he exchanged arctic drilling rights for access to supply from Texas and Gulf of Mexico oil fields, as TIME noted in December.
Musk met with Donald Trump previously at a sit-down with tech industry leaders late last year, and also joined his Strategic and Policy Forum. In a prior Q&A with investors, he noted that Trump’s obvious bullishness on fossil fuels might not necessarily preclude potential upside for the alternative fuels sector.
Because SpaceX and Tesla also house so much of their manufacturing operation in the U.S., Musk also likely has reason to be optimistic given Trump’s vocal promotion of U.S.-based manufacturing and regulatory relaxation for companies that choose to build domestically. Still, it’s incredibly weird and at least a little troubling to see him express positive feelings about a Secretary of State pick whose career history has seemed at odds with the public corporate missions of both Tesla and SolarCity.

568,Here’s how Chevrolet built a practical electric vehicle with the 2017 Bolt EV,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/heres-how-chevrolet-built-a-practical-electric-vehicle-with-the-2017-bolt-ev/,2017/01/24," 



Chevrolet said it was going to bring an affordable, long-range electric vehicle to market – and it did, with the 2017 Bolt EV. I visited Palo Alto to find out more about the Bolt EV, and the tech behind it, speaking to the car’s lead engineers and designers.
The Bolt itself was present, too, of course, an impressive car currently shipping to customers that offers an equally impressive drive (more on that in a forthcoming post). Also strangely present in absentia was Tesla, which is the company that has yet to make good on a similar promise to deliver affordability and range in an EV package.

Chevrolet was quick to point out than in Canada at least, it’s outselling Tesla two to one when it comes to electrified vehicles, before the Volt has even launched. That’s if you count the Volt, Chevy’s hybrid electric with a 53-mile pure electric range and gas-powered extend range of 420 miles total. “We are the leader in the electrification of vehicles,” a spokesperson told a room of journalists at the Bolt first drive event.
The Bolt EV does feel like a vehicle capable of leading the industry; the car’s 238-mile range from its 60 kWh battery is better than the 210 mile EPA rating on Tesla’s 60 kWh Model S (though the 75, 90 and 100 kWh options all offer better estimates than the Bolt), and it costs less than half the price of the lowest-specced Tesla. So how did Chevrolet get here?

The Bolt EV is the product of a lengthy design process that involved Chevrolet rethinking car construction and power supply from the ground up, according to Bolt Vehicle Chief Engineer Mike Lelli. He walked us through the car’s use of materials, which balances structural rigidity where it needs it most, with flexibility and weight savings where it can afford it, to help maximize interior space without compromising on battery mileage.
That battery is also uniquely designed, with continuous rectilinear shape that undergirds the vehicle, making it possible to have a low, flat continues floor throughout the car while distributing battery weight evenly and helping create a low center of gravity.
Lelli says that all the hard word that went into designing the Bolt EV as a vehicle tailor-made for balancing range and comfort has paid off, and the evidence is the shipping car itself, which manages to sneak under the $30,000 threshold in the U.S. with incentives (and only just exceeds $30,000 in my home province of Ontario after credits and incentives).

The motor, too, is an exercise in elegant simplicity. It actually only has one physically engaged “gear,” so to speak: Park. There’s a latch that will ensure it can’t move when in park, but otherwise speed is adjusted by changing the rotational velocity of the axle within the motor.
Here’s the thing: Chevrolet has succeeded at its initial goal, but the Bolt EV is still going to face a big test in terms of its ability to appeal to general consumers. Other automakers will be watching closely to see if the Bolt does well, and that’ll inform their own decisions to pursue a similar path twitch models of their own. GM, too, will likely change its strategy regarding EVs considerably depending on the outcome of the bolt.
Leaving aside the tech within, and the stakes, however, Bolt is also just a fun car to drive: Stay tuned for a deeper drive into how it performs in practice coming up shortly on TechCrunch.

569,Goodyear tests tires with Tesloop,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/goodyear-tests-tires-with-tesloop/,2017/01/24,"
It’s easy to get caught up in all the technology being built into cars of the future — ADAS, autonomous capabilities, V2X, and on and on. It’s also easy to forget that so far — until we get our flying cars — there are four points of contact between most vehicles and the road. The tires.
Goodyear has of course not forgotten this, and it sees the writing on the shared, autonomous wall. It’s partnered with Tesloop, the company that ferries passengers from Los Angeles to Las Vegas in Teslas running on Autopilot as often as possible, to see what effect cutting-edge technologies are having on the tires.
“We’re looking at new businesses and new business models,” said Jim Euchner, who heads the company’s global innovation team. “We look at how the world is changing and how that will affect Goodyear’s direction. We see a lot of trends, and we’re trying to understand them before they become mainstream.”
He noted in a telephone interview that there are a lot of weak signals out there that may fade, but there are trends that cannot be missed: consumer fleets of shared vehicles, autonomous vehicles, connected vehicles, and electric vehicles. “Tesloop is all of the above,” Euchner said.
The partnership is brand new, so there’s no data to share yet. But Goodyear entered this partnership with a goal of learning as much as possible. Tesloop represents what the company calls lead users: “people who are experiencing the world in advance of what it might be,” Euchner said. This gives Goodyear an understanding of the issues Tesloop experiences, like how tires wear, how they’re best managed, and how tire design could be improved for these use cases in the future.
“In some sense, it’s just a vehicle with tires,” Euchner said. “[Goodyear] tires are fitted on the vehicle, and they’re working well. On the other hand, Tesloop is working in a mode different from a typical user. The cars are more in autonomous mode and covering more distance, up to 5,000 miles in a week.” That’s real-world experience and data that can’t be produced on test tracks or through predictive modeling.
“Tesla is designed as a performance vehicle — Ludicrous mode and all that kind of stuff,” Euchner said. “As part of a fleet, it’s not leveraging that performance. It’s comfort and distance; that’s what you learn” from real-world tests.
The team is hoping to learn what this kind of use case requires and if that means developing an entirely new tire or recommending another type of tire that the company already has available.
“It’s interesting and cool to find something at the intersection of so many mega trends,” Euchner said, saying that the innovation team should have its first results in about six months. “We want to find the places where the future is and live it, not just observe or read about it, and integrate that into our business.”

Ford has picked up a new executive with a strong history of success in marketing and communications across a range of verticals; the automaker announced today that Musa Tariq will join as vice president and chief brand officer at the company, acting as the senior-most creative and strategic branding employee at the company across its global operations. Tariq will join Ford on January 30, coming most recently from Apple, where he was the company’s Global Marketing and Communication director for Retail.
Prior to Apple, Tariq was senior director of social media and community at Nike, and before that he was Burberry’s first-ever social media lead. His unique blend of experiences should set him up well for Ford, since he has exposure on the fashion and lifestyle side, and plenty of tech perspective from his time at Apple. Automakers have always used lifestyle as a key messaging mode for their branding efforts, but the tech portion is relatively new to their approach – and yet increasingly important.
Tariq will report to both Ford’s EVP of Global marketing Sales and Service Stephen Odell, and to its group vice president for communications Ray Day, but the carmaker is clearly hoping to inject some fresh perspective into its branding efforts by bringing in a young exec like Tariq in such a senior role with such a broad mandate.

Donald Trump met with top execs at all three major U.S. automakers on Tuesday, in a sit-down in which he laid out his desire to see the car companies create new factories in the U.S. and boost their stateside output. His comments at the meeting echoed sentiments expressed by Trump throughout the campaign and early into his presidency on Twitter and elsewhere.
Trump said at the meeting he’ll cut regulations, noting he believes they can cut them “by 75 percent, maybe more” and leading to expedited approvals for new manufacturing facilities, reiterating earlier commitments to do the same, and noting that environmentalism in general is “out of control” in his opinion. These comments were made with FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne in the room, whose company is currently facing both EPA and Department of Justice investigations regarding the carmaker’s alleged use of software to control emissions and skirt established U.S. limitations on the same in production vehicles.
Also present were GM CEO Mary Barra and Ford CEO Mark Fields, making this the first time all three top execs at the so-called Big 3 met with the U.S. President since a meeting with former President Barack Obama in 2011 to discuss a deal that would set a target of doubling fuel efficiency across U.S. vehicles by 2025. Obviously, this meeting had quite a different tenor.

Fields said that “we’re very encouraged by the President and the economic policies that he’s forwarding,” and cited Trump’s decision to pull out of the TPP as a sign of why he’s “optimistic about working with the new administration. ”
“We’re excited about working together with the President and his administration on tax policies, on regulation and on trade to really create a renaissance on American manufacturing,” Field said, when interviewed by reporters following the meeting.
“There’s a huge opportunity, working together with industry and with government that we can improve the environment, improve safety and improve the jobs creation and the competitiveness of manufacturing and we’re looking forward to all the elements that Mark talked about to be able to do that,” added GM CEO Mary Barra.
FCA’s Marchionne responded to a parting question by a reported asking if the execs every felt intimidated by Trump’s aggressive tweets at them regarding keeping manufacturing jobs in the U.S., with a simple “No” delivered with impeccable comic timing. FCA also provided the following statement from Marchionne via email:
I appreciate the President’s focus on making the U.S. a great place to do business. We look forward to working with President Trump and members of Congress to strengthen American manufacturing.
Trump has also reportedly effectively shut down the EPA, putting a pause on all the agency’s activities while his administration reviews its budget, spending and policy initiatives, something which is highly unusual even during a transition of power. He also will sign executive orders to push both the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines forward, both of which have been opposed by environmentalists, but will mean increased access to traditional fuel sources in the U.S.

572,Automotive executives see 10 times more revenue potential in connected cars,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/automotive-executives-see-10-times-more-revenue-potential-in-connected-cars/,2017/01/24,"
Connected vehicles are booming – they’re often mentioned in the same breath as autonomous cars, but are much more achievable from a technical perspective. Car makers are increasingly making on-board cellular data connections a standard option, too, and now we have some insight into why – a survey of automotive company executives found that they share the opinion that connected cars are huge revenue generators, with around 10x the earning power of the average non-connected vehicle.
The auto execs, responding to a survey created by KPMG with a sample group of 1,000 high-level car company employees, found that 76 percent of respondents said connected cars generate tenfold what a standard vehicle can produce in terms of available revenue streams, and 71 percent said the impact is so significant that just tracking unit sales to measure relative carmaker performance is an outdated measure that no longer paints an accurate picture.
The survey also found that 83 percent of execs agree that they’ll derive revenue from data shared by vehicle owners, and that they also need to focus on information security and privacy as a key value to attract customers in the future as a result.
It’s increasingly clear that vehicles have a role as a center for computing activity in our lives, which means data transfer, which means an opportunity to make money. This helps explain why automakers are so reluctant to give up the relationship between customers and their infotainment systems. It’s also about making sure carmakers are well-positioned to take full advantage of these new revenue opportunities when autonomous cars arrive, which will make cars even more important as a locus of connected activity.
Increasingly, automakers are describing themselves as service providers, and this helps explain why. Even if actual vehicle ownership decreases over time, the services side of the business stands to recoup and possibly exceed those losses, and car makers don’t want to cede that potential to software-specific tech companies.

573,LiquiGlide raises $16 million to get every last drop out of packages or tanks,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/liquiglide-raises-16-million-to-get-every-last-drop-out-of-packages-or-tanks/,2017/01/24,"
If you think it’s frustrating trying to get that last drop of ketchup out of the bottle, or toothpaste out of the tube, imagine having to waste and clean valuable and sticky substances from pipes or tanks in a factory.
A startup called LiquiGlide has raised $16 million in a new round of venture funding to bring its patented slippery coatings to manufacturers around the world. Co-founded by CEO J. David Smith and Chairman of the Board Kripa Varanasi, LiquiGlide is an MIT spinout that made its debut at the school’s business plan competition the MIT 100k in 2012.
Smith explained here’s how the company’s coatings work:
“Think about putting oil in a frying pan. It’s a great lubricant. But oil wears off over time and can get into your food. This is a permanent, liquid impregnated surface. We lay down a textured solid layer, something like a thin sponge, that traps liquid there through strong capillary force. Then, whatever you want to slide on top of that can move around because the liquid is mobile.”
LiquiGlide’s proprietary formula consists of flavorless, odorless and already FDA-approved ingredients, Smith said. The coating does not interfere with recycling. The CEO said, “Eliminating the need to wash out a container improves the chances that someone will recycle it. And clean materials are easier to recycle, so we can improve the sustainability of packaging overall.”
TechCrunch asked Smith if LiquiGlide employees use the coating to make anything for their own fun, like lightning-fast snowboards or a ridiculously effective Slip-N-Slide. The CEO said not yet, but the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup has been inundated with inbound requests from students, inventors and businesses that want to use the coating in a wide range of applications.

Staying focused is a challenge, he admits. But investors expect LiquiGlide to use its funding for hiring as needed, and to focus on “packaging and tanks,” i.e. companies that make consumer packaged goods and packaging, or businesses that make industrial tanks or require their use.
Investors in LiquiGlide’s new round included: Structure Capital, Valia Investments, Struck Capital, Pilot Grove and others who Smith did not have permission to name. The funding brings the company’s total equity raised to $25 million to-date. Its last round of $7 million was led by Roadmap Capital.
Managing Partner at Structure Capital, Jillian Manus, said: “We brand ourselves as the ‘architects of the zero waste economy.’ And LiquiGlide is like a poster child for us in a lot of ways. It represents the entire thesis here because this helps reduce wasted water, solvents, energy, product and packaging.” She said the company is facing a massive, and immediate, global market opportunity with urgent interest from automakers in both the US and China.
While Smith did not have permission to name all of the corporations that are testing or using LiquiGlide’s coatings in their packaging or equipment already, the company previously announced deals to work with Norwegian packaged goods conglomerate Orkla, Elmers the glue makers, and the Pact Group in Australia, a major packaging maker there.

574,Kreisel’s fully electric Mercedes G-Class is the Terminator’s off-road vehicle of choice,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/kreisels-fully-electric-mercedes-g-class-is-the-terminators-off-road-vehicle-of-choice/,2017/01/24,"

Electric vehicles tend to be designed with a certain customer in mind, and typically this imagined buyer is probably bookish, possibly vegan and mostly concerned with getting around in maximum efficiency. Tesla shook up this stereotype a bit with its speedy sports cars, but the new Kreisel customized Mercedes G 350 d with a fully electric drive train adds another dimension to the image of the prospective EV buyer.
The project came together thanks in part to a high-profile design partner and stakeholder: Arnold Schwarzenegger. The actor and former California governor drives a Mercedes G in the U.S., but along with Kreisel, had a desire to create a version of his beloved car that also meshed with his values and priorities when it comes to seeking out renewable energy alternatives wherever possible.
“To me, with the electric version of this fantastic car, a dream has become true”, Schwarzenegger said in a press release revealing the vehicle. “The initial test drive was a real pleasure: The Kreisel is incredibly sporty and perfectly benefits from the advantages e-mobility has to offer. I really look forward to the following test runs and to the gradual further development in California.”

Yes, that’s right: The man who played Harry Tasker is the official test driver for the first converted Mercedes G, and he’s doing to be helping with further design and development happening stateside in partnership with Austria-based Kreisel Electric.
This first prototype was built in just two months, and carries a “realistic” maximum range of 300 kilometres, which is impressive for a vehicle whose frame isn’t designed for maximum EV efficiency. It’s powered by an 80 kWh battery, and the car also claimed a 3 second faster 0 to 60 mph time of around 5.6 seconds, when compared to its gas-guzzling V6 progenitor. It also supports fast charging, recouping 80 percent of its capacity in just 25 minutes.

It’s a very cool retrofit, and hopefully one that willing buyers can eventually pick up as a (likely expensive) aftermarket modification. Kreisel is currently building a factory for large-scale production of its electric battery packs for use by automotive OEMs and other clients, so this is more of a side project. But the Gubernator gets what the Gubernator wants.

Ford has begun testing of its new Transit Custom Plug-In Hybrid with Transport for London, working with the UK city’s local transit authority to pilot 20 of the new vehicles in use during a 12-month trial with select London businesses for commercial use. The pilot of the vehicles, which feature a pure electric range of around 31 miles according to European agency measurement standards, is designed to pave the way for broad production and sales in Europe beginning in 2019.
The Plug-in Hybrid Vehicle (PHEV) version of the Transit is one of 13 total new electric or hybrid vehicles that Ford will introduce globally over the course of the five years, including a hybrid Mustang, F-150 and other cars to be announced later. The 20 PHEV Transit vehicles in this pilot are expected to be able to cover the majority of their daily use on their electric motors, Ford says, since their internal city routes to deliver goods or answer service calls shouldn’t typically exceed that capacity.
Development of Ford’s test fleet for the London trial is supported by a £4.7 million ($5.8 million U.S.) grant from the UK’s Advanced Propulsion Centre, a government-funded research facility that was created in 2013 in partnership with industry to advance low emission alternatives to fuel-burning engines. London has also committed to creating an “Ultra Low Emission Zone” in the city core by 2020, which will incur a fee on any vehicles that exceed tight carbon output standards.

The 100D option was added early Friday morning, promising an additional 20 miles of range based on EPA standards.
That means the Model S with the 100D battery pack gets 335 miles instead of 315 for the P100D, Electrek notes, and the Model X gets 295 miles instead of 257 miles for the performance option. Both of these options will bump the price of the car by an additional $3,000 vs. the 90D battery pack option, which remains available for purchase.
The boosted range means you’ll be foregoing the possibility of a sub-2.4 second 0 to 60 mph time, and in fact will have to settle for just 4 seconds for that sprint start. If you can live with that still very impressive acceleration, the added range will probably be a more attractive option to most people who aren’t buying a Tesla strictly to drag race.
As with all new Tesla’s coming off the production line since late last year, these new model options will include all the hardware on board to achieve full self-driving capabilities once the software is ready to make that possible, which will probably not be until at least 2018 for a broad public release.

578,Here are the first 10 official U.S. proving grounds for autonomous vehicle testing,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/19/here-are-the-first-10-official-u-s-proving-grounds-for-autonomous-vehicle-testing/,2017/01/19,"
The U.S. Department of Transportation has identified 10 sites as officially designated proving grounds for autonomous vehicle testing in the U.S., including The Willow Run, Michigan-based American Center for Mobility; Concord, California’s GoMentum Station; the City of Pittsburgh and more. The sites are designed to help the locations share best practices and information, forming a core community that Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx hopes will help spur the collective progress of autonomous vehicle development.
The proving grounds were narrowed from an applicant pool of more than 60, which included a range of different types of organizations, including privately held facilities, state transportation departments, municipalities and cities and academic institutions. The choices, in the end, were made by the DoT based on a number of factors, including a healthy mix of conditions and facility types, with the aim of building a final designee list that can provide a range of testing scenarios and share that data collaboratively with one another.
Federal designation gives these initial pilot program members a chance to help set the national tone on autonomous vehicle and systems standard in the U.S.: They’ll likely be instrumental in helping the DoT establish its further recommendations and guidelines for companies developing autonomous vehicle tech, and help establish the process through which self-driving arrives on U.S. roadways for consumer and commercial uses.
Here’s the full list of all 10 pilot designated proving grounds:

City of Pittsburgh and the Thomas D. Larson Pennsylvania Transportation Institute
Texas AV Proving Grounds Partnership
U.S. Army Aberdeen Test Center
American Center for Mobility (ACM) at Willow Run
Contra Costa Transportation Authority (CCTA) & GoMentum Station
San Diego Association of Governments
Iowa City Area Development Group
University of Wisconsin-Madison
Central Florida Automated Vehicle Partners

579,Uber settles FTC lawsuit claiming it misled drivers about pay,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/19/uber-settles-ftc-lawsuit-claiming-it-misled-drivers-about-pay/,2017/01/19,"
Uber settled a lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission today for $20 million. The lawsuit alleged that the ride-hailing app recruited drivers by misleading them about the amount of money they could earn through the app and the auto financing deals they could get through Uber’s Vehicle Solutions Program.
The lawsuit claims that Uber made “false, misleading, or unsubstantiated claims regarding driver earnings and its Vehicle Solutions Program.” The FTC says that, although Uber advertised that drivers could earn between $16 and $29 per hour depending on the city in which they drove, only a fraction of drivers actually earned the advertised amount.
In Boston, Minneapolis and Philadelphia, fewer than 10 percent of drivers earned the advertised amount, according to the FTC. In several other cities, the rate was a bit higher — fewer than 30 percent of drivers earned the advertised rate in Dallas, Phoenix and Seattle.
Uber also promoted the Vehicle Solutions Program as a low-cost way for drivers to buy a vehicle, saying drivers would get the “best financing options available” and have “unlimited miles.” The FTC suit claims this wasn’t the case at all — in fact, Uber had “no basis” for these statements. The rates offered by Uber were often higher than those commercially available, the FTC says.
By settling the lawsuit, Uber did not admit to the allegations. An Uber spokesperson told TechCrunch, “We’re pleased to have reached an agreement with the FTC. We’ve made many improvements to the driver experience over the last year and will continue to focus on ensuring that Uber is the best option for anyone looking to earn money on their own schedule.”
The FTC will distribute the $20 million settlement back to drivers, according to the Independent Drivers Guild, an organization that represents Uber drivers in New York City.
“The reality of being a ridesharing driver is a far cry from the rosy picture these apps describe and it is encouraging to see the FTC take them to task and refund drivers. Companies like Uber shift cost, risk, and burden onto drivers and taxpayers when they fail to provide the basic benefits so many Americans take for granted, from health insurance to sick leave,” said Independent Drivers Guild founder Jim Conigliaro Jr. “Drivers deserve the fair pay they were promised, tips like other workers in the service economy, and unbiased data on the earnings and expenses of ridesharing.”

Solaria Labs, Liberty Mutual Insurance’s tech incubator, has created an API developer portal to bring together public data and “proprietary insurance information” to help users find potentially safer routes — and help them assess damage when that doesn’t work out.
The AI in the API gives users repair estimates post-crash. “The AI Auto Damage Estimator app technology was trained using anonymized claims photos so the software could be built,” wrote Ted Kwartler, the assistant vice president of Liberty Mutual Innovation, in an email. So if you do end up in a crash, you can take a picture of the crumpled fender and upload it to the app. The AI will compare it with thousands of photos to determine which one is most like your car’s damage and tell you on the spot what the likely cost of repair will be.
The API also aggregates public data on things like auto theft, parking citations, and crashes to help drivers find the safest routes and parking places. The “proprietary insurance information” is added to make the collected data useful for users. “It’s a combination of insurance expertise and consumer testing to help guide the decision of what services to make available and how to organize the data,” Kwartler said.
Photos are anonymized for the purpose of training the AI, and the data used by the API to determine routes is publicly available. “Liberty Mutual will not share personally identifiable usage data we collect with any third party except to service customers’ auto policies, for research, or as required by law,” according to Kwartler.
Developers who want to get their hands on this AI can sign up for updates at the Solaria Labs website. It should be available in the coming months.

582,NHTSA’s full final investigation into Tesla’s Autopilot shows 40% crash rate reduction,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/19/nhtsas-full-final-investigation-into-teslas-autopilot-shows-40-crash-rate-reduction/,2017/01/19,"
The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has released its full findings following the investigation into last year’s fatal crash involving a driver’s use of Tesla’s semi-autonomous Autopilot feature. The report clears Tesla’s Autopilot system of any fault in the incident, and in fact at multiple points within the report praises its design in terms of safety, and highlights its impact on lowering the number of traffic incidents involving Tesla vehicles overall.
The full report is embedded below, but some sections of note include a section where NHTSA notes that crash rates involving Tesla cars have dropped by almost 40 percent since the wide introduction of Autopilot. It also notes that its investigation did not find any defects in the design or implementation of Tesla’s automatic emergency braking systems (AEB) or its Autopilot cruise features. The report also states that Tesla properly anticipated the potential for driver misuse in the design of Autopilot, studied those potential effects and incorporated it into the product’s final design before broad rollout.
It’s essentially as good as result as Tesla can have hoped for from the U.S. traffic safety agency’s investigation, which took place over the last six months. Reuters reported earlier on Thursday that the investigation would not result in a recall of Tesla vehicles, but the full findings show that in fact, the federal regulatory body found plenty to praise while conducting its inquiry.
The investigation does conclude with a minor admonition that Tesla could perhaps be more specific about its system limitations in its driver-assist features, but acknowledges that all required information is present and available to drivers and vehicle owners.
Tesla issued the following official statement regarding the end of NHTSA’s investigation and its findings:
At Tesla, the safety of our customers comes first, and we appreciate the thoroughness of NHTSA’s report and its conclusion.

583,U.S. traffic safety agency to close Tesla Autopilot investigation without recall request,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/19/u-s-traffic-safety-agency-to-close-tesla-autopilot-investigation-without-recall-request/,2017/01/19,"
The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) will close the investigation it began six months ago into a driver death that occurred while using Tesla’s Autopilot highway semi-autonomous driving feature, Reuters reports. The investigation did not find cause for a recall of Tesla vehicles with Autopilot, the report claims.
There’s no dispute from anyone involved that Autopilot was engaged when the accident occurred. The crash, which resulted in the death of 40-year old Ohio resident Joshua Brown, happened on a divided highway when a semi-truck crossed the lane perpendicular to a Model S driving with Autopilot engaged, and the Autopilot system could not detect the white trailer against a white sky, and also discounted the object from radar detection because it was designed to filter out objects that resemble overhead road signs.
Tesla has noted that this is the only recorded death in the history of Autopilot use, which now has more than 222 million miles driven. Meanwhile, traffic fatalities in the U.S. using human-powered vehicles result in a fatality around every 94 million miles. Tesla has also since made improvements to its Autopilot system, employing more sophisticated radar sensing with updates that Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said would’ve helped avoid the fatal crash that killed Brown.
When Tesla announced these improvements, Musk also noted that the company had been keeping NHTSA very much in the loop on Autopilot updates.
We’ve reached out to Tesla for comment, and will update if we receive more information.

584,Panasonic wants to expand Tesla partnership to sensors for self-driving,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/19/panasonic-wants-to-expand-tesla-partnership-to-sensors-for-self-driving/,2017/01/19,"
Panasonic is hoping that it can get even closer to partner Tesla, after the relationship between the two has proven so fruitful in the realm of electric vehicle batteries. The Japanese company is looking to become involved in the production of Tesla’s self-driving system, too, with a proposal of collaborating on sensor development.
That’s according to Panasonic CEO Kazuhiro Tsuga, who expressed interest in Tesla’s self-driving tech in an interview with Reuters on Thursday.
“We are deeply interested in Tesla’s self-driving system,” CEO Kazuhiro Tsuga told Reuters. “We are hoping to expand our collaboration by jointly developing devices for that, such as sensors.”
Currently, Panasonic is the exclusive supply partner for Tesla for batteries used in its vehicles, including the Model S and Model X. It will also supply the upcoming Model 3, which will require a significant increase in supply since Tesla aims to ship 500,000 of these cars in its first year.
Panasonic is a co-investor in Tesla’s Gigafactory, with $1.6 billion contributed to the $5 billion facility, and it will be working with Tesla more extensively on solar energy products going forward.The company also makes CMOS image sensors, and is currently working on a new version which would allow for sensing at very high-speeds of objects in motion, without the sacrifice in terms of distorted images normally associated with that kind of image detection.
Imaging sensors are a key part of an autonomous car, and the more accurate these become in a range of settings, the better for the eventual sensor fusion that combines data including photographic images, radar and LiDAR sensor info.
Teaming with Panasonic on sensors could help Tesla move more of that part of the business in-house, a move which is currently part of former Google self-driving car project Waymo’s strategy to help build more integrated systems with lower component costs over time.

585,Ford patents a car camera system to get you the best shots for social media,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/18/ford-patents-a-car-camera-system-to-get-you-the-best-shots-for-social-media/,2017/01/18,"
Ford has a new patent out for a vehicle camera system – but it’s not designed for use in autonomous cars, as you might imagine. Instead, it’s a vehicle-mounted camera concept that would use data fed by the vehicle itself about its speed, trajectory and more to determine how to best position themselves to get the best shots.
The Ford patent, which was originally filed in 2015 and discovered by Patent Yogi, describes the system as an answer to the problem of people attempting to use their own smartphones and standard cameras to snap photos and record video while their vehicle is moving, and even while driving. Ford’s alternative presents a system designed to be used without driver involvement, and with externally mounted cameras that also wouldn’t be impeded by windows or a car’s internal structure.
Ford’s patent talks about how a user could pre-define a range of movement that the system could use in getting a shot, providing some control from the driver over the field-of-view, while leaving the act of actually pushing the shutter to the system while the vehicle is in motion. It’s a way to provide control while also ensuring the driver stays focused on the road.
Companies file patents all the time, of course, and few of them ever make it all the way to production. But this one’s interesting in that automakers are already integrated cameras across the outsides of vehicles in an effort to help spur the development of autonomous driving tech, and because there is a pressing need by all automotive industry stakeholders to adapt to the impact increased mobile device use has on vehicle safety.
With vehicles increasingly featuring built-in connectivity, ways to automatically share scenic trips via social media might be cool, but it also opens up questions about how connected we want our lives to be. Still, just a patent application at this stage, but interesting to see some of the ways automakers are thinking about tackling the potential for mobile device distraction.

Tesla will be making electric motors and gearboxes at its Nevada Gigafactory, in addition to batteries. The news comes from Nevada governor Brian Sandoval, who discussed that additional manufacturing plans for the Gigafactory during a policy speech on Tuesday.
The Gigafactory, which officially opened for business last year, is a massive facility with a $5 billion price tag, a solar-power generating roof and a final physical footprint of around 5.8 million square feet, with total usable square footage of more than 13 million feet thanks to use of multiple internal floors. It began large scale battery production for use in Tesla’s Powerwall and Powerpack products earlier this year, and will spin up production for Model 3 battery units later in 2017.


Pleased to announce that @TeslaMotors will expand its investment in #NV by producing electric motors & gearboxes at   #Gigafactory #nvsots
— Governor Sandoval (@GovSandoval) January 18, 2017



Expanding production capacity to include electric motors and gearbox components should definitely help Tesla make use of its expanding space at the Nevada facility, and Sandoval says it’ll also result in 550 new jobs at the manufacturing site in his state, Fortune reports. The Gigafactory is only around 30 percent complete right now, with new modules being brought online as they’re completed thanks to its unique design.
Tesla likes to own as much of the vehicle production process as is possible, and especially in the case of core technologies it believes will eventually drive its ability to be cost competitive. It currently builds its electric motors for the Model S and Model X in-house at its Fremont, CA factory, but using the Gigafactory for Model 3 production makes sense, given Tesla has a goal of building 500,000 of the upcoming electric sedan in its first full year of production.

587,Deliver My Ride delivers another car buying service,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/17/deliver-my-ride-delivers-another-car-buying-service/,2017/01/17,"
Deliver My Ride, a new car buying site from the new firm MadDog Technology, is the latest to offer a car buying service without the buyer having to visit the dreaded dealership.
Deliver My Ride made the interesting choice to be website only so far; there is no smartphone app. Users create an online profile that will be sent to multiple dealerships and brands for free (the site makes money by building a $500 transaction fee into the quote). Then the site serves up the vehicles it finds that fit the user’s profile.
The car can be delivered to the user’s home or office without that person having to visit a dealership. The entire transaction allows the buyer to remain anonymous until the end, so no spammy emails from local dealerships as punishment for daring to research vehicles online.
There are a few hitches in the service, like the fact that there isn’t an app. Also, on the question of test drives, the site recommends finding a friend who has the same make and model of vehicle and driving theirs or asking for their feedback. Or the user can abandon the anonymous security of Deliver My Ride to contact a dealership to arrange a test drive.
In any case, you do get to test the car before signing the final paperwork when the car is delivered. And if you do go all the way through the process and purchase a car via Deliver My Ride, you get a free one-year AAA membership.
It’s an interesting landscape for Deliver My Ride to jump into right now. Beepi, a peer-to-peer used-car buying and selling app, shrank its service area and let 180 of its staff go in December 2016. At the same time, Beepi merged with Fair, another car marketplace app fronted by veterans of BMW, Tesla, TrueCar, and others. Fair has yet to go live, so keep an eye on this space.
There’s also Shift, which is focusing on picking up Beepi customers who were left out in the car-buying-app cold when Beepi concentrated its services on its Southern California home base. Like Beepi, and unlike Deliver My Ride, Shift deals in private party sales, not dealerships, and most of its business so far is in California, with an outpost in Washington, D.C.
MadDog Technology was founded in 2014 and is chaired by Peter Karmanos Jr., who founded Compuware Corp. in 1973. (He’s also the owner of the Carolina Hurricanes hockey team.) The service is launching in Karmanos’ hometown of Detroit, making it one of the few not based in California.

Tesla has begun deploying the Autopilot update for HW2 vehicles (those with updated sensor and computing hardware designed to eventually provide full self-driving capabilities). All Tesla cars with the HW2 kit, including Model S and Model X vehicles, are now receiving the over-the-air software update that includes the updated Autopilot features, but Tesla CEO Elon Musk notes that it’ll be present only in “non-actuating” mode for the time being, with activation of the software coming as early as the end of this week.


HW2 Autopilot now downloading to all HW2 cars, but in non-actuating mode to assess reliability. If looks good, actuation by end of week.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 16, 2017



The update for HW2 models has been in testing with a small subset of cars since New Year’s Eve, with a group of 1,000 vehicles receiving the update early for verification purposes ahead of a rollout to the entire fleet. Last week, Musk also said that a new HW2 update revision was being pushed out to those testers, as well as the broader population in shadow mode, meaning the Tesla team has probably quashed a few bugs since its initial deployment.
Features including auto-steer and intelligent speed maintenance have not been available to Tesla owners with HW2 sensors and computing hardware, because Tesla redesigned its approach to the semi-autonomous driving features to suit the new capabilities.

Thursday we learned that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is investigating Fiat Chrysler U.S. (FCA) regarding alleged software-based circumvention of emissions standards. On Friday, Bloomberg reported that the U.S. Department of Justice is also looking into that same alleged failure of its responsibility to disclose the use of emissions altering software for possible criminal prosecution.
The probe into FCA is similar to the one that Volkswagen encountered in its own emissions scandal, though Bloomberg reports that fewer overall vehicles are involved in the Department of Justice’s inquiry into Fiat Chrysler. It isn’t clear how far along the DoJ’s investigation is at this stage, only that it’s underway.
The DoJ’s criminal investigation into Volkswagen resulted in criminal charges against six high-ranking employees of the automaker, who were indicted on Wednesday. FCA CEO Sergio Machine said during a media call that his company’s issues are “nothing” like the Volkswagen situation, however.
“We are confident that no one at FCA committed any fraud or tried not to be compliant,” Marchionne said, as reported by Bloomberg. “We may be technically deficient but not immoral. We never installed any defeat device.”
FCA released a statement on Thursday saying their emissions management software “meet the applicable requirements” set out by the EPA, and do not constitute “defeat devices” designed to circumvent emissions standards as laid out by the agency.

Tesla’s latest software update rolls back a change it implemented only recently, removing a hard cap on Autopilot on undivided roadways that meant drivers could not set the cruising speed above the posted limit for the road. The limit enforcement changed from a previous cap at 5 mph above the legally defined ceiling, and it was a tweak that was greeted with dismay by a number of Tesla owners.
The reversion of the rule was noted by a user on Twitter (via Electrek), and confirmed by Elon Musk himself, as well as other Tesla owners who went through with the update and found the limit removed on their vehicles’ Autopilot systems, too.


@gurnam @brianstucki @reddit It is
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 12, 2017



The decision to roll back this particular feature will probably go over well with Tesla owners – reaction seemed primarily against the move to begin with, at least on social media. Tesla drivers seem to believe on balance that in this case at least, they should be trusted to use the Autopilot features responsibly.
It’s also true that not allowing a little leeway above the limit could actually make Autopilot software more dangerous, since in general the pace of traffic tends to not adhere exactly to the posted roadway speed. Other software features, including alerts and system disabling when Autopilot determines a human driver should take over, probably contribute more to safety than a strictly capped speed limit.
This is representative of the challenges Tesla faces in bringing further autonomy to market, however – they’ll always have to balance user experience and customer satisfaction with safety concerns, and it’s very interesting to see how they continue to negotiate that line.

591,Naver will soon begin testing self-driving cars on Korean roads,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/13/naver-will-soon-begin-testing-self-driving-cars-on-korean-roads/,2017/01/13,"
South Korean internet giant Naver is in the final stages of receiving sign-off from the top Korean transportation regulator to begin tests of its self-driving vehicle technology on public roads. The company confirmed to TechCrunch that it will begin testing its self-driving tech on roads as soon as it receives final approval, which Yonhap reports could be as early as next month, according to industry observers.
Naver is huge web portal operator in Korea, and also owns the nation’s largest mapping platform, as well as messaging app Line and the Snapchat-like Snow. Its interest in self-driving tech is part of its larger focus on artificial intelligence, something that Naver CTO Chang-hyeon Song noted was a key are for his company going forward, “in order to [help it] compete with global companies.”
Beyond that, Naver also believes that autonomous vehicles are an incredible opportunity in terms of data gathering, which is closer to its core business. “In the era of autonomous, the vehicle itself will become a platform for exchanging information,” a Naver spokesperson told TechCrunch. Like Baidu and Google, having self-driving as part of its portfolio actually blends very well with the larger goal of being integral to the online lives of its customers.
Naver says it currently has Level 3 autonomous driving tech in development, which still requires a driver present to take over when the car deems it necessary, and is working towards Level 4, where the driver can actually relax and not pay attention as the vehicle drives itself. It will house its self-driving car efforts under a new independent company under the Naver umbrella it’s launching that will also be responsible for its efforts in AI and robotics, spurred by a $425 million commitment the South Korean company has made towards funding those efforts.
Like other tech companies getting into self-driving, Naver is looking to boost its efforts through partnerships with various companies, though it’s not yet ready to discuss any kind of timing or specifics around its commercialization plans for autonomous vehicle technology. Competitors like Alphabet’s Waymo are already announcing the groundwork for potential commercial service, via partnerships with large automakers like FCA.
South Korea has already approved ten automakers and research organizations for public road trials of self-driving vehicles, so Naver will be number 11 if their approval comes through, which seems very likely at this stage.

Nissan will start testing a version of its electric Leaf car with autonomous driving capabilities in London next month, kicking off its first European trials on public roads, Reuters reports. The Japanese carmaker also recently announced that it would be building two new vehicles in the UK, where it makes around a third of the total volume of vehicles produced overall.
Self-driving trials for Nissan are not entirely new; the company began testing its first prototype back in October on public roads, demonstrating Piloted Drive capabilities that are intended to become a fully autonomous driving system in production vehicles by 2020. Piloted Drive also has a single-lane, highway-only version that will be included on vehicles including a Qashqai SUV set for release next year in Europe.
The second iteration of its self-driving tech, on track for 2018, will introduce a multi-lane highway autonomous mode, with full autonomy across both city and highway again planned for 2020.
Nissan’s choice of the UK is probably held by the British government’s drive to create a nurturing regulatory climate for companies looking to test and develop autonomous drive systems in the country, as well as its strong existing relationship as one of the country’s top car producers.

593,Volvo creates a car sharing unit,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/12/volvo-creates-a-car-sharing-unit/,2017/01/12,"
Volvo announced that it’s joining other automakers in creating a business unit devoted to car sharing. The new shared mobility unit will be based on Sunfleet, a car sharing service that Volvo has run since 1998. So after nearly two decades, Volvo should be pretty comfortable with the service.
The new unit will expand Sunfleet globally. Right now, it only operates in 50 cities in Sweden, but those cities have 50,000 subscribers using a fleet of about 1,200 Volvos “rarely more than a year and a half old,” if Google’s translation of the Swedish Sunfleet site is correct.
Sunfleet is a station-based car sharing system akin to ZipCar rather than a free-floating service like car2go. Users register on the website, book a car, unlock it with an app, and find a key in the glove box to start the car. Since the fleet is swapped out pretty frequently, it probably won’t be long before users will be able to unlock the car with the app too.
As it stands now, users can rent a car once, sign up for a monthly subscription, or take a car for the weekend, from Friday at 5 p.m. to Monday at 8 a.m. Because Sunfleet is station-based, you pick up the car where it’s parked and return it there when you’ve finished your short-term rental.
Volvo promises to announce more details of its car sharing and mobility unit’s expansion in the coming months, but if it’s stuck with Sunfleet this long, expect to see a similar (though maybe autonomous?) system as part of the global expansion.

594,Elon Musk teases potential 2.34 second 0 to 60 mph time via Tesla Ludicrous+ mode,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/12/elon-musk-teases-potential-2-34-second-0-to-60-mph-time-via-tesla-ludicrous-mode/,2017/01/12,"
When will our thirst for speed be sated? Perhaps when Tesla CEO Elon Musk makes good on his most recent “achievable” max speed claim of just 2.34 seconds for 0 to 60 mph. Musk teased this might be possible from a new Ludicrous+ easter egg being pushed out over-the-air to Tesla vehicles, which can already boost the Model S P100D time to 2.4 seconds, just about on par with Faraday Future’s demonstration F 91 prototype.


Promising early results from the Ludricrous Easter egg. Looks like 0 to 60 mph in 2.34 sec (Motor Trend spec) might be achievable…
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 12, 2017



FF made a big deal about their 0 to 60 mph time at this year’s CES, even going so far as to bring a P100D Model S out on stage to race it against the test F 91 in a time trial. The company also claims a 2.39 second 0 to 60 mph achievable speed, though the actual trial ran a little slower than that, owing to less than ideal road (stage) conditions according to Faraday.
Tesla’s Model S got that 2.4 second speed update via an OTA push that went out just after Faraday’s splashy reveal, however, and that’s something that’s coming to production vehicles – not to a car that FF admits won’t enter production until at least 2018, for a price point yet to be announced.
Musk’s tweet today indicates that Tesla could stretch the limits further still, pushing down its max achievable 0 to 60 mph to a speed that would best Faraday’s yet-to-ship best time by 0.05 seconds, which is a veritable eternity in the hyper-competitive performance car world. So far, he’s not talking specifics, beyond that the time would be achievable within Motor Trend’s testing specifications for measuring this kind of acceleration, but it’s an exciting possibility for speed-hungry Tesla owners nonetheless.

595,EPA accuses Fiat Chrysler of using software to skirt emissions standards,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/12/epa-accuses-fiat-chrysler-of-using-software-to-skirt-emissions-standards/,2017/01/12,"
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued a notice to Fiat Chrysler (FCA), informing the automaker that approximately 104,000 vehicles, including specific models of 2014, 2015 and 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokees and Dodge Ram 1500 trucks, included “at least eight” pieces of engine management software that helped them “skirt” EPA rules regarding emissions limitations. This software was not disclosed by FCA to the EPA.
The alleged violations run counter to the Clean Air Act, which requires that carmakers show the EPA via certification that their vehicles meet standards set at the national level to help curtail and control air pollution. Part of the Clean Air Act specifies that software included in a vehicle that can affect emissions from the car be fully disclosed and explained as part of the certification process, but FCA did not do that in the case of the named vehicles sold with model years mentioned above.
The EPA says that as a result of its actions, FCA could face “civil penalties and inductive relief.” A new testing process put in place by the EPA in September 2015, which was introduced following discovery of Volkswagen’s notorious EPA emissions standard violations, brought the modification to light, according to the EPA. That means we have to wonder how many more automakers might face similar blowback thanks to the more rigorous screening process.
For its part, FCA US says it’s “disappointed” with the EPA’s choice to issue this notice, saying it’s been working behind the scenes with the EPA for “months” regarding requests to explain its in-vehicle emissions management tech. FCA’s full statement is included below:

FCA US Response to EPA
January 12, 2017 , Auburn Hills, Mich. – FCA US is disappointed that the EPA has chosen to issue a notice of violation with respect to the emissions control technology employed in the company’s 2014-16 model year light duty 3.0-liter diesel engines.
FCA US intends to work with the incoming administration to present its case and resolve this matter fairly and equitably and to assure the EPA and FCA US customers that the company’s diesel-powered vehicles meet all applicable regulatory requirements.
FCA US diesel engines are equipped with state-of-the-art emission control systems hardware, including selective catalytic reduction (SCR). Every auto manufacturer must employ various strategies to control tailpipe emissions in order to balance EPA’s regulatory requirements for low nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and requirements for engine durability and performance, safety and fuel efficiency. FCA US believes that its emission control systems meet the applicable requirements.
FCA US has spent months providing voluminous information in response to requests from EPA and other governmental authorities and has sought to explain its emissions control technology to EPA representatives. FCA US has proposed a number of actions to address EPA’s concerns, including developing extensive software changes to our emissions control strategies that could be implemented in these vehicles immediately to further improve emissions performance.
FCA US looks forward to the opportunity to meet with the EPA’s enforcement division and representatives of the new administration to demonstrate that FCA US’s emissions control strategies are properly justified and thus are not “defeat devices” under applicable regulations and to resolve this matter expeditiously.

Daimler has led a new $17.2 million funding round in Starship Technologies, a startup created by Skype founders Ahti Heinla and Janus Friis, the WSJ reports. The round will help U.K.-based Starship expand its efforts to bring rolling drone deliveries to city sidewalks around the world.
Starship’s six-wheeled autonomous delivery bots are essentially coolers on wheels, keeping contents hot or cold, as well as safe and secure, while bringing them the last mile of their journey to a customer’s doorstep. The drones designed to stick to the ground as a way to simplify the regulatory process, where airborne delivery craft face much more scrutiny and higher standards when it comes to safety requirements before they can enter even supervised trials.
The startup’s delivery bots are equipped with an array of cameras and sensors, and are designed to be tamper-resistant and fine to operate in a variety of weather conditions. They’ve been in testing in both Europe and North America on public streets, and have even begun small-scale commercial service in London as of late last year.
Daimler’s interest in robotic delivery isn’t limited to Starship; it also invested in drone technology startup Matternet, and debuted a drone delivery van concept built using its Mercedes-Benz vehicle platform and the startup’s aerial quadcopters, which it displayed at this year’s CES.

Las Vegas, transportation beat reporters can’t quit you; CES was like a car extravaganza, and now you’re launching a self-driving, fully electric shuttle on public streets. The shuttles are the result of a partnership between shuttle-maker Navya, fleet logistics provider Keolis and the city of Las Vegas, and began picking up members of the public today, riding a regular route along iconic Fremont Street between Las Vegas Boulevard and Eighth Street — right in the thick of regular traffic.
The route will run between January 11 and 20, and will use Navya’s ARMA shuttle, which previously underwent testing in the U.S. at the University of Michigan’s MCity autonomous testing facility, and which has been deployed in France since 2015. The test is part of Las Vegas’ broader efforts to create a designated area in the city’s urban center for testing autonomous and connected cars. Vegas has also invested significantly in connected infrastructure, including connecting traffic lights throughout the downtown area.

Shuttles with defined routes are a relatively low-risk area for companies to deploy autonomous-driving tech, as there are fewer variables to take into consideration as compared to more free-roaming self-driving vehicles. You can map the route extensively, for instance, and having connected infrastructure present is also a plus. It’s likely we’ll see much more of this kind of autonomous-tech deployment well before we see self-driving consumer-owned vehicles on roads.

598,Training self-driving cars on the streets of Los Santos with GTA V just got easier,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/11/training-self-driving-cars-on-the-streets-of-los-santos-with-gta-v-just-got-easier/,2017/01/11,"
The DeepDrive project has made it possible to use Grand Theft Auto to train self-driving cars for some time now. But today, the work is being integrated and open-sourced with OpenAI’s Universe. The collaboration will cut the once day-long setup time down to just 20 minutes.
Training AI frameworks on synthetic data is all the rage these days. Large tech companies and startups alike are digging around for nifty training methods that can reduce the barriers to getting in the self-driving car game and make annotations less of a pain. Companies like Udacity have been steadily releasing real-world driving data, but community needs to continue to grow in volume and specificity.
OpenAI’s Universe came about late last year to address some of this market need, launching with Atari 2600 games, 1,000 flash games and 80 browser environments to help democratize access to training resources. The addition of GTA V is a significant improvement over racing Flash games and opens the door to computer vision and autonomous car researchers.
“Simulation is essential if you really want to do a self driving car,” said Zhaoyin Jia, tech lead for Google self driving at today’s AI Frontiers Conference.
While I can’t say I would want any self-driving car being trained based on my GTA V driving, the game is realistic enough for slightly more disciplined individuals to get the job done.
One of the biggest advantages of training off of a virtual environment is that its primed for harvesting labeled data. Objects in GTA V, whether traffic signs or cyclists, can easily be bounded and analyzed.
One Princeton student, Artur Filipowicz, specifically made use of this to collect 1.4 million images of stop signs in a variety of conditions to predict the chance a given intersection will have a sign present and to estimate the distance to the given sign.
Pulled from research entitled “Driving School II, Video Games for Autonomous Driving” completed by Artur Filipowicz of Princeton University
Starting today, those with a penchant for DIY training can obtain the source code and AMI for GTA V and nab a pre-trained starter agent with TensorFlow and Caffe versions. The kit also includes reward functions for collision avoidance, minimizing destination distance, and maximizing adherence to the road. By putting things in terms of utility, computers can better emulate human thinking with reinforcement learning.
The team is running the game off of a Windows virtual machine hosted in the cloud that communicates with Universe via web sockets and VNC. That provides accessibility to engineers on both Mac and Linux. Oh, and don’t forget, before you get started you’ll need to buy yourself a copy of the game too.

Speaking at the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit, key original iPod team member and Nest founder Tony Fadell explained why Detroit is such an ideal place to test autonomous vehicles. He points out (via Katie Burke on Twitter) that Detroit has two key ingredients: a low population, and a lot of existing city infrastructure.
Detroit’s population is currently around 680,000, which is down considerably from over 1 million at the beginning of the 1990s, and a peak population of around 1.8 million according to the 1950 U.S. census. That change means that Detroit has the city infrastructure of an urban area with at least twice its population density – meaning there’s plenty of city streets, traffic lights and intersections to deal with, but fewer pedestrians to also manage at the same time.
Minimizing the unpredictable human variable while also maximizing the similarity with other city settings at an early stage of testing is key; it’s why other efforts like the University of Michigan Mcity testing facility were created, to simulate road conditions in a controlled test environment.
Michigan also recently passed laws that make it among the most amenable regulatory environments in the U.S. for testing autonomous vehicles, including a path towards allowing them on public roads without drivers behind the wheel. And Detroit’s true four-season climate means testing can take place in a wide range of weather conditions, for perspective on system performance that will apply in a broader percentage of teh world.
Fadell also discussed how he’s been investing in more automotive companies lately. After he departed Nest, Fadell co-founded Actev Motors, maker of a fast electric go-kart – but the founder said at the AN World Congress that he’s also investing in tech like a radar-based LiDAR alternative.

601,"I drove BMW’s prototype self-driving 5 series, and then it drove me",https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/10/i-drove-bmws-prototype-self-driving-5-series-and-then-it-drove-me/,2017/01/10," 



BMW had a story to tell at CES this year, a story of what our lives might look like when there’s more continuity between what we do at home and what we do in our cars, thanks to new features coming to market, including connectivity and self-driving capabilities. I became a part of that story as I drove a prototype 5 series (fun even in manual mode) onto a public Las Vegas highway, pressed a button on a steering wheel and let the car’s test Co-Pilot system take control so I could focus on other tasks.
Like filming the HUD on the windshield two-handed using our cameraman Clint’s Canon C100 from the driver’s seat; folding my arms behind my head and closing my eyes to relax and enjoy the ride; or turning completely around in the driver’s seat to face BMW’s Jay Patel and have a conversation about the various things I can do in the car thanks to his company’s Open Mobility Cloud now that I don’t have to pay attention to the road.
To back up a bit, before I ever got behind the wheel BMW took me through a demo of what the start of a day might look like once drivers and partners are using its Open Mobility Cloud throughout their lives. A prototype “smart window,” which is not intended to represent a product BMW intends to ship, but just a possible interface for the kind of driver data it wants to keep track of across its customer’s lives, let me arrange a schedule and set tasks. One example was to take a movie a child in the family was watching on Amazon and throw it to your car, letting them later pick it up where they left off at home.

It basically seemed to function like our phones do now, letting us pick up digital activities on the go, but this time through the in-car interface. While on the ride, for instance, activating the demo kid’s movie also automatically retracted a rear window shade and closed the sun roof, optimizing the rear seat viewing environment. Meanwhile I got a route to my appointment for the day from my calendar in the vehicle, with navigation automatically picking up the baton. A reminder that I needed to get a gift prompted another in-car activity, letting me order some last-minute presents on Amazon, which we actually collected on the ride at an Amazon Now pick-up point.
I had time to mess around with all this stuff because once we entered the highway, I didn’t have to worry about the road at all. This wasn’t a cruise assist demo where you have to maintain attention; Patel encouraged me to turn away from the windshield, relax and enjoy the mountain view.
A safety driver in the passenger seat was nonetheless present in case anything went wrong, with a one-handed manual control able to speed us up or slow us down. We were also following a BMW lead car, meant to simulate a convoy between a “Mom” and “Dad” en route to a party at “grandma’s house,” but it’s just as likely the lead car was there to block for the self-driving vehicle, and provide a reference point for it to easily track, too.

Patel noted that I was one of the most comfortable people who’d done the demo (and we were among the last), and in truth I did trust the car pretty completely, pretty quickly. I did take in the scenery, did some filming as mentioned, gave a lot of two-handed thumbs-ups and pretty much otherwise thrilled at giving up the wheel. The one thing I couldn’t do was use my smartphone to shoot a POV video — because being at the wheel while on a cellphone is illegal in Nevada.
Both the trip out and the trip back went smoothly, both while I was in control on city streets and while the car was driving on the open highway across a few miles. Then, once we returned, a Segway robot equipped with Intel tech greeted us, directed me to enter a pre-parking zone and bade me exit the vehicle as the autonomous parking system ended the trip, reversing the 5 series neatly into its spot.

602,Tesla hires Apple’s creator of Swift as new VP of Autopilot Software,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/10/tesla-hires-apples-creator-of-swift-as-new-vp-of-autopilot-software/,2017/01/10,"
Tesla has a new vice president heading up Autopilot efforts — Chris Lattner, whose departure from Apple was reported only earlier today. Lattner worked at Apple for 11 years, where his chief contribution was creating Swift, Apple’s most recent programming language, which is relatively easy for beginners to pick up and begin using to create apps for macOS, iOS and beyond.
The role at Tesla had been filled by SpaceX VP of Software Jinnah Hossein, who was doing double-duty at both companies (much like Elon Musk himself does in the CEO spot). Tesla says they’re “excited” about Lattner’s ability to help them “accelerate the future of autonomous driving,” in a blog post announcing the move.
Lattner’s history includes creating the Clang compiler and designing the LLVM compiler optimization infrastructure. He was also a key contributor to the evolution of Objective C and worked on Apple’s Xcode software development tool during his time at the iPhone maker. He also apparently builds beautiful raw-edge wood furniture:

— Chris Lattner (@clattner_llvm) January 9, 2017



Tesla’s poach of Lattner is a significant win for Tesla, given the breadth of his influence on software development and his expertise. Tesla announced late in 2016 that all of its vehicles going forward would have all the hardware on board necessary for full self-driving capabilities, and Elon Musk said that he’s aiming to have a fully autonomous coast-to-coast test drive of a Tesla car ready for the end of this year. Lattner could be a big help in achieving those ambitious goals in Musk’s typically aggressive timelines.

603,Arcimoto looks for investments via Fundable,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/10/arcimoto-looks-for-investments-via-fundable/,2017/01/10,"
Arcimoto brought the eighth iteration of its three-wheeled electric vehicle, the SRK, to CES 2017. This is the version that will be produced this spring in Eugene, Oregon, where the company has its headquarters, and that the first buyers will have delivered to their doors by summer 2017.
It’s been a long road for Arcimoto, which was founded in 2007 in Eugene. For nearly a decade, it was funded privately. Founder Mark Frohnmayer provided the bulk of the cash for the company in the early days using money from his previous company, GarageGames. Now, as the company is preparing to move to its production facility and build SRKs, it has opened an account on Fundable to attract outside investors.
The SRK was never intended to be a full-sized car; it was always meant to be a small, inexpensive, zero-emissions urban vehicle. (Or Fun Utility Vehicle, according to the latest video from the company.) It has two motors at the front wheels and a top speed of 80 mph. It has some creature comforts, like heated seats, but the only cargo space is a basket behind the second passenger. Hard-shell doors are optional, and depending on the state you live in, motorcycle helmets might be required.
But it has an estimated fuel economy of 230 MPGe and a range of more than 100 miles, and it can be charged at any household outlet, either 110- or 220-volt. The first-run of SRKs won’t have climate control or a sound system, though those are in the works for later versions. There may even be a DC fast-charging system for future models.
If you’re into this electric runabout idea right this second, you can put down a $100 refundable deposit on the Arcimoto website, which will apply toward the $11,900 MSRP of the vehicle when you take delivery.

At CES this year, Mercedes-Benz brought a polished, complete version of their drone delivery van to display, complete with drones nested up on the roof, and a working intelligent front LED display. The van was impressive in person, a Cylon-esque facade hiding a working mobile warehouse within.
Mercedes-Benz and drone startup Matternet unveiled the concept in September, which they refer to as a ‘Vision Van.’ The idea is that Matternet’s autonomous drones pick up packages from the van and then fly them to their destination from the central operating base of the van, which can move around as needed to get the drones within their 12 mile range. The vans autonomously deliver and return, and can change out their own batteries for a fresh charge.

The van on display at CES had a working front LED array, which can display rudimentary images, including animations of pedestrians crossing in front. The information display can also indicate the vehicle’s intended behavior, such as turns, to outside passengers.
In back of the van is an inventory storage rack with a path down the middle that looks very much like what you’d expect to see in a standard inventory warehouse. The racks are designed to slide out as a complete array, so that the vans can be stocked quickly just by swapping out the entire interior in one go. A robot arm in the van that packs the drones via a slot in the roof is programmed with the package locations on each inventory rack before the van starts making its rounds.
It’s definitely an upgrade on the average UPS van you see today, but Mercedes-Benz has no immediate plans to bring it to production. Still, a cool look at one possible future.

An in-car display is a terrible thing to waste, but Delphi’s new multi-layer dash screen technology could help automakers do something more interesting with all that in-car real estate. The infotainment and instrument panel-focused tech looks outstanding in person, as I discovered at CES, and Delphi CTO Jeff Owens says it’s ready to roll for OEMs looking to spark something new in the cabin.
The technology creates a sense of depth using two high-fidelity digital displays layered on top of one another, providing a 3D experience without any need for glasses or more complicated eye tracking or detection. The effect is more solid than other glasses-free 3D tech as a result, and Delphi has figured out ways to trick the eye into believing there’s more than just two layers of depth in what you’re looking at.

Delphi’s done all the testing required in terms of classifying the tech as automotive grade, and is now in the process of talking to carmakers around use of the technology. An automotive OEM would license Dephi’s multi-layered display for use in their own vehicles, and then likely customize it to fit with their current branding, so a final product would look different compared with what you see here.

That’s too bad, because in person what Delphi has created is very visually impressive, and Owens tells me they’ve also tested it on even higher density displays that are better still at conveying a sense of physicality for the virtual instruments.
In-car GUI is not something that carmakers are always great at, and in fact the visual and digital elements of infotainment displays from most OEMs look outdated or clumsy. Delphi’s technology has the potential to really make an immediate positive impact on the look of instrument clusters and cabin controls, which are increasingly going virtual. Other suppliers are striving for more complicated holographic interfaces with gesture control, but this multi-layered look combined with some haptic for eyes-off feedback are the right recipe for right now in my book.

GM is teaming up with Girls Who Code (GWC), the national no-profit seeking to help close the gender gap in STEM education and professional fields. The partnership will see GM provide a $250,000 grant to help grow GWC’s Clubs, an after-school program that provides free activities for students in community centers and academic institutions to help boost computing and other technical skills and encourage more women to enter the high-tech workforce in the U.S.
GM CEO Mary Barra explained in a press release that she’s interested in promoting STEM education because her own success owes much to her early studies and career as an engineer. Barra and GWC founder and CES Reshma Saujani are hosting 30 students from the Girls Who Code program at the North American Auto Show for a launch event with workshops covering vehicle connectivity, electrification, autonomous driving and also future mobility solutions like car sharing.
Barra and GM also think it’s important to do something to help reverse a troubling trend identified in recent research by Accenture conducted in partnership with GWC that found the percent of women in the workforce employed in computing tasks has dropped from 37 percent to 24 percent between 1995 and today. The hope is that through activities like those GM and GWC plan to provide via this partnership, that trend can be reversed, leading to a potential tripling of women in computing fields over the next decade.
Hosts for these events include GM’s director of Maven car-sharing Julia Steyn, VP of Tax & Audit Victoria McInnis, EVP of Global Manufacturing Alicia Boler Davis, Electric and Autonomous vehicles executive chief engineer Pam Fletcher and more. Top GM execs will also be working with GWC clubs and students throughout the coming year.

NHTSA looks to still retain two of its most senior staff through the transition, however, with acting Deputy Administrator Terry Shelton retaining her civil servant role and Executive Director Jack Danielson looking set to keep his position, which was created in a 2015 restructure of the organization.
Rosekind sought to reassure observers that NHTSA would continue its work in taking a proactive approach on safety following Trump’s inauguration, highlighting the retention of top staff as a reason why industry stakeholders can expect a through-line across the next presidency. Hemmersbaugh has been a key part of Rosekind’s proactive approach, which included measures like setting out recommended guidelines for companies working on autonomous vehicles, and on mobile device makers whose products could be used by drivers in cars.
Hemmersbaugh also penned NHTSA’s February letter to Google, which outlined how the agency would treat Google’s (now Waymo’s) self-driving system as the driver for legal purposes, which is a key step in helping self-driving cars actually come to public roads for general use.
Trump has selected Elaine Chao for Department of Transportation secretary, a choice seen by some as beneficial for companies pursuing self-driving vehicle technology. Her confirmation hearing takes place this Wednesday.

608,Next-gen Samsung EV battery gets 300+ miles of range from a 20-minute charge,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/09/next-gen-samsung-ev-battery-gets-300-miles-of-range-from-a-20-minute-charge/,2017/01/09,"
Samsung’s SDI battery subsidiary announced a new battery cell designed for use in electric vehicles that offers improved density to manage a max range of up to 372 miles on a full charge, with a quick charge capacity that will help it regain 310 miles or so of charge on just 20 minutes of charging. Unveiled at the North American International Auto Show for the first time, the new battery tech come with a 10 percent decrease in the number of units and weight required vs. current production battery units made by Samsung SDI.
Mass production isn’t set to begin until 2021, but the tech should arrive in time to supply the first crop of autonomous cars, which are also targeting street dates sometime within that year from a range of manufacturers. EV and self-driving are tied closely to one another, since both are crucial components for operating the kind of on-demand ride-sharing fleets planned by Ford, among others.
A 20-minute charge delivering that kind of range would help considerably with making EVs more practical for more drivers; it’s around the time you’d spend at a rest stop using the restroom and grabbing coffee or a snack, after all. By comparison, Tesla’s superchargers currently manage to provide around 170 miles of range on a half-hour charge, so Samsung’s planned tech could approximately double that.
Tesla’s long-term goal, according to CTO JB Straubel at the time of the Supercharger’s first unveiling, is to get charging times down to between five and 10 minutes, and it has been quietly boosting the maximum theoretical output of the stations themselves (though Tesla vehicle batteries are still limited to 120 kW in terms of how much power input they can accept).
Tesla produces its own batteries in partnership with Panasonic, and just began construction on its latest generation cells at its Gigafactory in Nevada, while Samsung’s new 21700 cylinder cell model is currently being used by “U.S. automobile startups” in their EVs, according to Samsung SDI. One of those startups is Lucid Motors, a new EV company with a lot of Tesla talent on board.

609,"Ford CEO Mark Fields on building mobility services, acquisitions and partnerships",https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/09/ford-ceo-mark-fields-on-building-mobility-services-acquisitions-and-partnerships/,2017/01/09," 



Ford CEO Mark Fields was at CES this year, and I got some time to talk to him about what Ford’s doing with its Smart Mobility business, why it made sense to acquire Chariot, to partner with Amazon for in-car Alexa integration, and to generally build out its services portfolio.
Fields told us how Ford evaluates when it makes more sense to own something itself, and when it makes sense to trust others to help it meet its goals in the market. He also explained that Ford’s core business is still going to be around designing and building great vehicles, but usage becomes an important outgrowth – these services will continue to drive demand for building cars, as ownership perhaps become less important to individuals, and fleet-based offerings might become the best way to continue growing its business.
I also talked to Fields about Ford’s partnership with Amazon to put Alexa in cars, and asked about the future of virtual assistants in vehicles. It sounds like Ford is totally open to the possibility of that becoming a bigger part of the in-car experience, and will evaluate where best to partner or build its own assistant services as the market develops.
Ford’s also discussing its vision of the future at the North American Auto Show this week, with a City of Tomorrow Symposium that looks at how smart infrastructure and connected vehicles, along with ride-sharing services like Chariot, might transform what our urban environments look like in the not-too-distant future.

610,Ford’s Chariot ride-sharing service will expand to 8 cities in 2017,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/09/fords-chariot-ride-sharing-service-will-expand-to-8-cities-in-2017/,2017/01/09,"
Ford-owned Chariot, the on-demand commute ridesharing service it acquired through Ford Smart Mobility last September, is going to expand to eight new cities in 2017, including one outside the U.S., Ford announced at the North American International Auto Show this year in Detroit. Chariot currently operates in its home city of San Francisco, and in Austin, TX, with a pilot project launched late last year in Lake Tahoe to supplement ski resort transportation.
Chariot offers on-demand ridesharing via Ford Transit shuttles, looking to supplement public transit bus routes and local trains with commuter routes that aren’t well served by either of those existing solutions. Ford Smart Mobility, the company Ford founded to focus on mobility alternatives to vehicle ownership, acquired Chariot in September.
Ford CEO Mark Fields told me at CES that he believes his company will increasingly address the transportation needs of customers in a variety of different ways, and that Chariot is a key component of putting that strategy into practice. Chariot CEO Ali Vhabzadeh has previously told me that his company planned to expand aggressively in 2017, but now we know the specific scope of those expansion plans.



Chariot’s approach to new markets might look different compared to what it’s doing in San Francisco and Austin; Vhabzadeh explained to me previously that the company is keen to look at market needs when planning new service in a different area. Its Lake Tahoe project shows one small example of what that kind of flexibility might look like.
Ford’s long-term plans include bringing an autonomous ride-sharing business to market at scale by 2021, with the aim of serving “millions” of customers. This will most likely take place in urban centers first, where Ford will have done detailed mapping and route data gathering to prepare for launch, and Chariot is likely a big part of those plans.

611,Volkswagen’s I.D Buzz concept is a microbus for the self-driving era,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/09/volkswagens-i-d-buzz-concept-is-a-microbus-for-the-self-driving-era/,2017/01/09,"
Volkswagen’s new I.D. Buzz electric vehicle concept is a futuristic take on the microbus that revives the family camper for an era when we’ll spent just as much of our time on the road relaxing or hanging out with our fellow passengers as we will driving. The new EV design, Volkswagen’s second concept car in the I.D. line, was revealed at this year’s North American International Auto Show.
The Buzz has a max range of 270 miles on a single charge, and all-wheel drive, with a fully autonomous mode that allows the front seats to be reconfigured to face backwards towards the rear compartment. Depending on what you’re doing with the car, you can seat up to eight using the modular seating arrangement – or just create two luxurious, vehicle length loungers for relaxing while the car drives itself.

The in-car entertainment system is also designed to cater to different passenger arrangements, with a big, removable tablet in the center console and an AR-enabled heads-up display for overlaying information on your view out the windshield. The car remembers who you are using Volkswagen ID, and can set preferences specific to any individual driver. A Beats partnership puts an external speaker with Bluetooth connectivity in-car, which can then be removed for use outside the vehicle – maybe at a camp site, for instance.
Like other autonomous cars, a lot of the communication between vehicle and people takes place via the lighting system, which includes LEDs outside that can communicate things like when autonomous driving is engaged with pedestrians, and ambient mood lighting within.

The microbus was always a car that people loved for its flexibility; it excelled at providing a great getaway vehicle for families with an adventurous spirit. The new I.D. Buzz looks like it has the same DNA, but with an update for a more tech-savvy generation.
Buzz is a concept, so there’s no guarantee we’ll ever see a production vehicle like it on the road, but Volkswagen is committed to hit a sales target of 1 million electric vehicles annually by 2025, with a range of models, so this reimagined microbus could definitely still see the light of day at some point.

612,Tesla moves towards greater autonomy with Autopilot rollout for HW2 cars,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/09/tesla-moves-towards-greater-autonomy-with-autopilot-rollout-for-hw2-cars/,2017/01/09,"
Tesla will begin rolling out its Autopilot features for vehicles with second-generation in-car computing and sensing hardware on Monday, Elon Musk announced via Twitter. The new revision will be deployed a to small test group of 1,000 initial testers, as well as all other Tesla vehicles equipped with the new hardware. Initially the update will be in shadow mode for those beyond the test pool, and then be turned on for active use by the end of the week if all goes well.
The new Autopilot functionality for HW2 vehicles will return features like adaptive speed and auto steer, which were not included initially even though they’re available for HW1 vehicles, those with the previous on-board computer and sensor suite. Tesla didn’t enable all Autopilot features on HW2 vehicles initially because the new hardware required a complete overhaul of Autopilot and how it works, in order to prime the pump for ever-greater performance of the system going forward, with the aim of eventually achieving true autonomous driving capabilities on existing vehicles.


New rev for Autopilot HW2 rolling out Mon to first 1000 & to rest of fleet in shadow mode. Also improves HW1 and enables Ludicrous+.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 8, 2017



HW2 Autopilot is just a step along that path, however; these features will definitely make it easier for drivers to manage highway driving, but they won’t allow for an experience where a driver can truly stop paying attention to the road. In fact, recent updates to Autopilot are designed to ensure that drivers either pay attention or face consequences – the system will disengage after a driver ignores repeated alerts to put hands on the wheel, and will not be available again until the car is stopped and turned off.
Initially HW2 Autopilot will cap use of lateral steering control at 35 mph, Musk notes, until they gather more data from the full fleet. But HW1 vehicles will get improved Autopilot performance via the update, too, and Ludicrous+ mode will be enabled for compatible vehicles, allowing for insane acceleration of just 2.5 seconds for a 0-60 mph sprint with the P100D
Newer Tesla owners will certainly welcome the availability of the full Autopilot feature set, which should arrive next week beyond that initial 1,000 person test pool provided they encounter no issues with this revision of the software. A first beta of Autopilot for HW2 vehicle owners began rolling out last week to that first testing group.

613,Take a ride with us in a self-driving Audi Q7 using Nvidia autonomous tech,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/09/take-a-ride-with-us-in-a-self-driving-audi-q7-using-nvidia-autonomous-tech/,2017/01/09," 



Nvidia had a strong showing overall at CES this year, but its most impressive demo had to be the self-driving vehicles it was showing off in a cordoned course built in a parking lot. The demo wasn’t on city streets, as were others like the Delphi ride, but it was impressive in a different way; mostly because no human sat in the driver’s seat of Nvidia’s cars.
Two cars were in rotation for Nvidia at its test track. The first is a Lincoln MKZ Nvidia purchased kitted with sensors ready for autonomous driving off the shelf from a third-party supplier that retrofits the vehicles specifically for this purpose, affectionately nicknamed ‘BB8.’ BB8 has been in testing with Nvidia for some time now, and is the company’s core vehicle for building out its neural network-based autonomous drive software.

The second was an Audi Q7, newly equipped with Nvidia’s DRIVE PX 2 in-car computer, which offers tremendous computing power in a very small package, and is suitable for handling the huge task of running a locally contained neural net that learns how to drive simply by observing the action of human drivers; these vehicles were trained in Vegas on only four days of driving, Nvidia’s Senior Director of Automotive Danny Shapiro told me. That means they gained their ability not by being told specifically the rules of the road, but by observing four days worth of driving behavior by humans, and then inferring rules from the behavior they observed.
Nvidia’s Drive PX 2 in-car supercomputer
Audi says it was super-impressed with what Nvidia could accomplish in such a short time, and in fact the Q7 is using only data from its front-facing camera combined with the PX 2 to accomplish this test ride. We sat in back while the car went around the track, with no one behind the wheel, and it did indeed perform perfectly. Nvidia simulated a number of different road types, including turf, track and dirt, and even created an on-demand road hazard with a movable construction detour, and neither vehicle had any issues with that.
Other demos of autonomous vehicles at CES were hands-free, but Nvidia’s was the only one I saw that was driver-free. Even on a closed course, that’s impressive, especially given the limited sensor input used. All the more reason to get excited about Nvidia’s plan to actually bring a self-driving AI-powered vehicle to market with Audi by 2020.

614,Waymo reveals completely homegrown sensor suite for Pacifica autonomous test car,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/08/waymo-reveals-completely-homegrown-sensor-suite-for-pacifica-autonomous-test-car/,2017/01/08,"
Waymo CEO John Krafcik is delivering the keynote address at the North American Auto Show’s Automobili-D conference Sunday, and he’s revealing a lot about the new Alphabet company’s progress and tech. Waymo, which began life as Google’s self-driving car project, has built all of its own sensors for use on its latest test vehicles, self-driving Pacifica minivans. Use of in-house sensors is huge, since it means Waymo can likely lay claim to controlling more of the self-driving car technology stack than any other player in operation today.
Much like Apple can do a lot more than most of tis competitors because it owns and builds both the software and the hardware for its product suite, Waymo can claim tighter integration between its sensor hardware, sensor fusion software, image recognition and other aspects of its self-driving system. Waymo also claims individual performance benefits in each of its new sensors, including vision cameras, radars and LiDAR, saying each provides better resolution, sensing distance and accuracy than the hardware it has been using on prior vehicles.

Krafcik also says that its decision to build out all of its sensor suites in-house has a significant talent benefit, since it means that it’ll now have deeply knowledgeable experts in each key sensing area, who can work closely with resources on the AI engineering side to ensure the best possible use of the gathered data by the car’s in-vehicle computational systems. Plus, development cycles should get shorter between generations of software and hardware thanks to their ability to control both.
Waymo also created two new categories of LiDAR in its effort to develop its own sensors. Previous vehicles used a single top-mounted medium-range LiDAR, but new short and long range sensing units included in this package mean that the surround view the car sees is now complete, and more granular detail detection both up close and at a distance.
Maybe most important from the perspective of Waymo’s ability to woo automaker partners is that building its own sensors gives the company significant cost advantages down the road. After the initial cost of research and development, cost reduction on a per unit basis should grow significantly over time, leading to Waymo’s ability to get a lot closer to reaching prices car OEMs are more comfortable at scale, more quickly. Krafcik says the cost of a single top-end LiDAR, which was $75,000 when Google began experimenting with self-driving vehicles, has dropped by 90 percent thanks to its efforts to build its own.

Waymo will field Pacificas with this homegrown sensor suite on board beginning in Arizona and California later on this month, Krafcik announced on Sunday. Throughout its time as Google’s self-driving car project and more recently as Waymo, the company has racked up almost 2.5 million miles driven, with most of those accumulated on city streets. It just take them just eight more months to pass the 3 million mile threshold. Volume is key for autonomous tech not only for training systems, but also for helping prove to regulators and industry stakeholders that th tech is actually safe.
Speaking of safety, Waymo says it’s had a four-fold improvement in performance of its vehicles in the last year, as measured by the number of disengagements (when a safety driver has to stop the self-driving software and take over manual control). In 2015, the number of disengagements was around 0.8 times per thousand miles in California, and currently, Waymo’s only seeing around 0.2 disengagements per thousand miles travelled.

616,Baidu and China’s BAIC Motor developing Level 3 autonomous cars,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/06/baidu-and-chinas-baic-motor-developing-level-3-autonomous-cars/,2017/01/06,"
At CES on Friday, Baidu announced a partnership with Chinese passenger vehicle maker BAIC Motor, to work together on a developing smart car tech, and Level 3 autonomous driving in particular. Vehicles resulting from this partnership with Level 3 autonomy will be entering road tests by the end of 2017, Baidu says.
Level 3 autonomy still requires human drives to be present, but less intervention is required on their part, and active monitoring isn’t a key component. Level 3 is seen as one to be avoided by some carmakers, including Ford, because of the complications involved in requiring a human driver to intervene on occasion but also allowing them to decrease their attention to their surroundings.
The other major part of the partnership includes Baidu offering telematics to BAIC, which will take place in the first half of 2017, and their agreement extends more broadly to collaboration on HD maps for use in autonomous driving, and in BAIC providing OEM capabilities for Baidu’s intelligent vehicle program in general. The two companies are also jointly launching a new research lab as part of their joint efforts.
BAIC Motor is the passenger car sub-group of BAIC Group, which is a state-owned automaker that also operates Foton Motor, the commercial and agricultural vehicle maker that Baidu partnered with in November to create an autonomous truck.
Baidu says it’s going to work to continue to expand its roster of automobile OEM partners, but besides its new arrangement with Foton, it also had some less positive news in November when Reuters reported that its joint research effort with BMW had fallen through. Dance partners are likely to change plenty before we see any actual self-driving cars out on the road, but Nvidia has been locking down new partners recently with new product-focused team-ups with both Audi and Mercedes-Benz announced at CES.

Nvidia already announced a partnership at CES to bring a AI self-driving car to production, and now Mercedes-Benz is also teaming up with the GPU-maker on a vehicle with AI on board. Nvidia and Mercedes-Benz are also setting an ambitious timeline for their goal; the two will field this new vehicle within the next 12 months, Nvidia confirmed to TechCrunch.
The news came out on stage at a talk between Mercedes-Benz VP of Digital Vehicle and Mobility Sajjad Khan, and Nvidia CEO and co-founder Jen-Hsun Huang on Friday at CES. It’s the result of a project the two began together three years ago, which helps explain why the car will be ready to get to customers by 2018.
Mercedes and Nvidia have been working together with a specific focus on deep learning and AI. Nvidia announced additional AI features powered by its in-car computing at its keynote earlier in the week at CES. These include Co-Pilot, which is a system that combines facial recognition, gaze tracking and more to help assist human drivers as a way to increase safety ahead of the advent of true autonomous driving on the roads.
Co-Pilot also uses voice recognition, and a vehicle’s external sensors to track objects outside the car including other vehicles and pedestrians, and can give the driver a head’s up if it also detects they might not be aware of potential road danger.
It’s not yet clear how the AI integration will work in the Mercedes-Benz vehicle, and whether it will be a version of Co-Pilot or something else, but Nvidia tells TechCrunch it will provide more details leading up to the launch.

Ford announced an updated Fusion Hybrid development vehicle for its autonomous driving testing late in December, and the car was on display at CES this year. The new vehicles include both a new platform in the base Fusion vehicle, and a new virtual driver system, which covers sensors arranged around the car, the sensor fusion system that combines all the data the car collects into one picture of the road for route planning, and a new compute stack in the vehicle to handle the task of actually driving.
I got a chance to take a look at the car on the show floor at CES, and to talk to Ford CEO Mark Fields about the new testing vehicle. Fields pointed out that the car has improved sensors, including better cameras throughout, with front, side and rear-facing cameras integrated into roof-racks for a design that looks more like an ordinary car you’d see on the road.

The new test vehicles also have two LiDAR sensors where the last version had two, and these actually boost a longer sensing range of 200 meters around the vehicle. The two LiDAR sensors are affixed to the A pillars on the vehicle, with a vaguely bug-like look thanks to their protruding support bars. It’s one of the few really obvious external signs (aside from badging) that reveals the car’s purpose, but it’s a big improvement in terms of the obviousness of the tech vs. older vehicles.
These LiDAR units are also technically improved; they’re Velodyne’s solid-state hybrid Ultra Puck LiDAR units, which can see at double the range of the previous generation. This is important because it means more decision-making time for the vehicle’s virtual driver; greater sensing range means more time to spot problems and take actions to avoid them.

Fields says that he expects the design to become more innocuous still in terms of obvious sensor placements over time, though he declined to give me any clues about what the final vehicle design for the autonomous ride-sharing fleet will be.
This Fusion Hybrid test car is on roads starting this month, with the fleet doing testing on public roads in Michigan, California and African, as well as at University of Michigan’s Mcity autonomous vehicle testing facility, which simulates a range of real-world driving conditions.

619,Here’s what it’s like to drive with Toyota’s Yui AI in-car assistant,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/06/heres-what-its-like-to-drive-with-toyotas-yui-ai-in-car-assistant/,2017/01/06,"
Toyota revealed a new concept vehicle with a virtual companion named Yui built-in at CES this year. The Concept-i goes beyond the average concept car, with an in-car experience that gives the driver an AI partner that acts as part copilot, part travel guide and part spa attendant, all the while getting to know you better over time.
I took a ride with Yui via Toyota’s CES show floor demo station, which recreates Yui’s cockpit and provides a simulated version of what a true Yui experience would be like.
To start things off, I used a Microsoft Surface to tell Yui (voiced by a male actor, by the way, a rarity among modern virtual assistants) a bit about myself. This would normally happen from social cues, like linked social network accounts and devices, to get to know its driver more organically, but I filled out a short questionnaire about what I like to do with my spare time and with whom, along with my name to shortcut the process for the purpose of the demo.
Once that was done, I entered the car and Yui greeted me, asking about my destination preferences. It offered three possibilities, all around the Bay area, but also suggested a day of shopping in downtown San Francisco as the top option based on what I’d just told it about my habits. I could also ask Yui simple questions not related to the trip specifically, like weather, and it was able to step a bit outside of its main domain to provide more info.

Once I confirmed with a simple vocal response that I was happy with Yui’s destination choice, we were off. A Toyota rep explained that at this stage I was still in manual driving mode, since we were in an urban environment on city streets. The heads-up display still identified and projected highlights around pedestrians and other potential road hazards, however, and in fact Yui simulated taking control to engage emergency braking at one point in manual mode, which it’ll do when it deems it necessary to avoid an accident.
Once on the highway, the experience changed considerably. The seat reclined as Yui entered self-driving mode, indicated by a change in the color of its main circular icon on the dashboard from blue to purple. The path marker on the HUD also changed to purple, and dash lighting started displaying an ambient pulsing pattern which Toyota says is designed to help trigger your body to enter relaxation mode.
Something else happened – the driver’s seat started giving me a really good lower back massage, which is actually hugely appreciated after days of walking around Vegas with a heavy backpack. Media could also be projected on the HUD, a Toyota rep explained, for another option for relaxing while in highly automated driving mode.
Once we exited the freeway, Yui returned me to manual control, bringing the driver’s seat back to a driving position. It also picked out some popular local tourist spots, and ended up selecting one that seemed like it would match my preferences and directed me there.

Yui ended up being courteous and helpful throughout the drive. The car also showed me an emotional map of my ride, since it had been analyzing my facial expressions throughout and could identify when I seemed happiest or most excited. Toyota says it would eventually be able to crowdsource this data and offer navigation options that provide not only the fastest route, but also the “happiest,” for example.
Where Toyota sees Yui adding value is in building a real relationship with its human driver, however. Yui is designed to live in the cloud, and to transfer from vehicle to vehicle as an owner buys new cars (or uses car-sharing services). A demo video of Yui from Toyota envisions a man forming a 20-year bond with his own Yui assistant, with the AI knowing about his family, interests and personality very deeply.
Yui is probably still a long way from real-world launch; Toyota’s own Research Institute has said confidently that self-driving is still a long way off. Questions like how much and when to trigger relaxation in a driver definitely complicate this, and while Toyota told me that it’s done a lot of work to help Yui do both those things now, it’s going to take a while and a lot of study before they find the right, safe balance.
Still, Yui presents an interesting, unique view of what it might be like to live with a constant AI companion. The potential of an on-demand chauffeur that also knows what to do to help you relax while on the road is very intriguing. It’s also extremely weird to imagine making a lifelong, bonding friendship with automobile software – like having an advanced Tamagotchi that can zip you around at speeds of 60 MPH or more.

620,Microsoft launches a new cloud platform for connected cars,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/05/microsoft-launches-a-new-cloud-platform-for-connected-cars/,2017/01/05,"
Microsoft isn’t building its own connected car — but it is launching a new Azure-based cloud platform for car manufacturers that want to use the cloud to power their own connected-car services. The new Microsoft Connected Vehicle Platform will go live as a public preview later this year.
“This is not an in-car operating system or a ‘finished product’,” Microsoft’s EVP for business development Peggy Johnson writes in today’s announcement. “It’s a living, agile platform that starts with the cloud as the foundation and aims to address five core scenarios that our partners have told us are key priorities: predictive maintenance, improved in-car productivity, advanced navigation, customer insights and help building autonomous driving capabilities.”
Microsoft also announced that it is partnering with the Renault-Nissan Alliance to bring the new connected-car services to Renault-Nissan’s next-gen connected vehicles. The two companies were already working together on other projects before this, so it’s maybe no surprise that Renault-Nissan is Microsoft’s first partner.
Microsoft is also working with BMW to develop that company’s BMW Connected platform on top of Azure. BWM and Nissan also showed in-car integrations with Microsoft’s Cortana digital assistant at CES this year, so your future car could potentially use Cortana to power its voice-enabled services. For the time being, though, it looks like these are still experiments.
Over the last year or so, Microsoft has often talked about its aim to bring “intelligence” to as many of its services as possible. It has also recently opened up Cortana to third-party developers, so bringing it to its connected car platform is a logical next step (and we’re seeing Amazon doing the same thing with Alexa, too).
Johnson also used today’s announcement to take a thinly veiled swipe at Google/Alphabet, which spun out its self-driving car unit a few weeks ago. “As you may have gathered, Microsoft is not building its own connected car,” she writes. “Instead, we want to help automakers create connected car solutions that fit seamlessly with their brands, address their customers’ unique needs, competitively differentiate their products and generate new and sustainable revenue streams.”

621,ChargePoint ups the fast charging ante,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/05/chargepoint-ups-the-fast-charging-ante/,2017/01/05,"
On the heels of EVgo‘s announcement that it was breaking ground on its first 350-kW public charger, ChargePoint announced at CES that it has developed what it calls an ultra-fast DC charging station that can deliver up to 400 kW.
The ChargePoint Express Plus is aimed at cutting-edge cars that charge quickly and have long ranges, like the Tesla Model 3 and Chevy Bolt — cars that could be taken on long trips, if there were enough high-powered charging stations spaced along highways.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance expects that sales of electric vehicles will reach 41 million worldwide by 2040, which would be 35 percent of new vehicle sales. The BNEF researchers found that EVs will account for a quarter of the cars on the road by then, and they’ll need to charge up.
The Express Plus chargers are also capable of charging these cars smarter. The stations will be able to read the battery’s state of charge and give more power to vehicles with lower battery power and less power to those that just stopped in to top off the charge. The system is also modular, using half-megawatt “cubes” that can be hidden behind some shrubbery. As power needs grow at a station, more power-providing cubes can be added. And, presumably, more landscaping.
The high power of the Express Plus chargers will potentially better serve electric transit, like buses, and service trucks that are out on the road all day. A quicker charge means more time on the road delivering passengers and packages.
The goal, according to ChargePoint, is to add new stations to the infrastructure. It’s the chicken that has to come before the egg of manufacturers ramping up production and consumers feeling confident in buying an EV. The Express Plus stations will be available for installation by early summer 2017.

622,Cadillac’s Book is a subscription car service that gives luxury customers options,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/05/cadillacs-book-is-a-subscription-car-service-that-gives-luxury-customers-options/,2017/01/05,"
Cadillac is among the many car manufacturers looking at alternate ownership models, and its new Book subscription service is a unique twist on something like a Zipcar or GM’s Maven. With Book, luxury customers who might ordinarily consider buying or leasing one of Cadillac’s vehicles can instead choose to sign up for a $1,500 per month service that provides on-demand delivery of a Cadillac with the carmaker’s top-level trim.
This gives fickle car fans the ability to more widely sample Cadillac’s lineup, instead of having to stick to just one vehicle. The cars available include the XT5, CT6, Escalade and V Series, and each car in the fleet is in the current model year. The price of being a member also covers taxes, insurance and maintenance, and there’s no cap on how many miles you can drive per month with your subscription.
Book reservations are made through a smartphone app, and cars aren’t just parked in designated spots like they are with Zipcar; instead, your vehicle is hand-delivered, with “white glove” service, per Cadillac. Members can trade the cars in or return them whenever they’re through, and can actually keep cars for longer periods, like booking an SUV for use throughout the winter.
It avoids hassles with keeping track of traditional finance options, and for the people who can afford Book, the ability to not have to worry about little things like what to do when you happen to want some more trunk space for a 5th Avenue shopping spree probably makes a lot of sense.
Cadillac’s launching Book first in the New York metropolitan area, with the aim of expanding it to other markets gradually. There’s no set term for the $1,500 per month service, so you can cancel at any time. Honestly, I’d probably use this myself if it was about 10x cheaper, so I’m curious to see what kind of pick-up they get from their higher-end target customers.

623,Honda’s Safe Swarm concept has cars mimicking fish for safer driving,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/05/hondas-safe-swarm-concept-has-cars-mimicking-fish-for-safer-driving/,2017/01/05,"
Honda is looking to nature to improve the safety of driving, using bio-mimicry of the behavior of a school of fish to inform a new technical concept it’s unveiling at CES called Safe Swarm. Safe Swarm uses vehicle-to-vehicle communication based on the dedicated short range communication standard to provide assistance to a human driver.
Safe Swarm essentially means that cues picked up by one vehicle equipped with connective communication tech can pass along information to others in proximity, far before a driver would be aware of anything. Cars can shuttle their collected knowledge down the line, propagating info about a pile-up potentially miles ahead in near real-time to help make it easier for human drivers to take action to avoid problems before they happen.

Other car companies are working on similar tech; Mobileye’s REM system works on a very similar basis, connecting vehicles equipped with Mobileye sensor tech so that they can share real-time traffic and road condition info to inform ADAS and other autonomous driving features. It’s a bit like a fully automated Waze that doesn’t require driver input.
This is another example of tech not imminently bound for production, but which conceptually shows the growing connectivity between cars. Autonomous cars would benefit greatly from something like Safe Swarm, of course, but it also has the potential to save a lot of lives before we reach true self-driving at the consumer level.

624,Honda’s Riding Assist gives motorcycles balance tricks from its Asimo bot,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/05/hondas-riding-assist-teaches-motorcycles-balance-tricks-from-its-asimo-bot/,2017/01/05,"
Honda’s new Riding Assist motorcycle model isn’t a shipping product yet, but it is an impressive technical demo. The concept at CES showed how it can help motorcycles maintain balance while traveling at low speed, something particularly tricky for even experienced drivers.
Speeds between 2 and 3 mph actually prove among the most challenging in terms of making sure a motorcycle stays upright, and Honda’s leveraging lessons learned from its development of Asimo the robot and its UNI-CUB rideable scooter-like transport to make sure bikes can manage balancing themselves, or assist human riders in keeping them level at those low speeds.
Riding Assist converts the motorcycle’s front fork from a standard geometry position to one more aggressively angled, which you might recognize as something closer to the geometry of a cruiser motorcycle designed for more leisurely speeds. The adjusted angle helps increase stability, and is managed by a dedicated motor attached to the front wheel.
Honda showed me Ride Assist working with a motorcycle travelling under its own speed: there were two pegs on either side to make sure it could rest when the system wasn’t engaged, but it succeeded in meandering out under its own power without falling over one way or the other, even when the handlebars angled in either direction.

Honda Riding Assist engineer Makoto Araki told me that the technology is currently not set for any specific release timeline, but it could help avoid a lot of injuries that happen to motorcyclists when you might not expect them. Others have already demonstrated advanced stabilization assist systems for high-speed biking, but this is an oft-overlooked area that is nonetheless ripe for potential improvement.
It’s also a great example of how Honda’s work in robotics can be leveraged across its product areas, for improvements that might affect a broader segment of its customer base more immediately. Personal robots like Asimo are still probably at least a decade away from any kind of real consumer pick-up or availability, but nested tech created through their development can have a material impact much sooner.

625,Honda’s NeuV is a mini electric concept car with emotional intelligence,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/05/hondas-neuv-is-a-mini-electric-concept-car-with-emotional-intelligence/,2017/01/05,"
Honda is another carmaker focused on supplementing the driving experience with an emotional, AI-based component. The NeuV, Honda’s latest concept which it unveiled at CES on Thursday, is a city-friendly lightweight electric car that has Honda’s Automated Network Assistant (HANA), built with SoftBank, on board to help personalize the driving experience. Through HANA, the car becomes aware of a driver’s emotions and moods, and can support driving choices as well as suggest media do other infotainment options.
NeuV has other tricks up its sleeve, too. The all-electric vehicle is designed to answer the issue of idle vehicles, which is most cars most of the time, according to recent studies, that show up to 96 percent idea rates for vehicles where they’re just sitting in driveways or otherwise parked. NeuV is designed to operate as apart of an autonomous ride sharing fleet, letting owners generate revenue from their vehicles when they’re not in use.
Another way NeuV can recoup costs is by managing electric power consumption from the grid, by intelligently monitoring electricity rates and charging only when it makes sense to do so from a cost perspective. NeuV is designed not only to only charge when rates are low, but also to actually sell back excess power it has stored to the grid during peak price times, which can actually help a user get an even better deal when purchasing that power back at low points. It’s sort of like your car is its own electricity market AI economies trader.

Honda also build digital payments into NeuV, allowing prepayment on the road for goods and services via bank account or Visa. There’s even an electric longboard in the back for last-mile transportation, making it easier to get around both inside and outside the car.
The outside design of the car is also unique, with doors that only extend about 20 mm beyond the frame of the car, and then pivot upwards to a 90-degree angle. This helps make sure the doors are accessible even in the tightest spaces, and has the added benefit of making it possible to build a very low step for entry with a full, unobstructed entryway for loading cargo and for getting in and out of NeuV.

NeuV’s exterior is also mostly semi-transparent glass, with underset lights that disappear when turned off. The surface of the car is designed to be reflective, so that it takes the surrounding environment and displays it back to observers, helping the NeuV feel like a more natural part of its surroundings.
Hana is at the center of NeuV, explains Nick Renner, a designer at LA-based Honda Advanced Design where the concept was created over the course of the past 18 months. The AI assistant occupied the car in many ways, but a driver’s primary interaction with it will be via a huge touchscreen that replaces the instrument panel entirely. It’s visible to the driver through the steering wheel, too, so that they can get contextual information at a glance easily, basically no matter where they’re looking.
“The actual design is inspired by a grand piano in the room,” Renner said in an interview. “Everything else is very simple, very understated, but there’s kind of this celebration of the technology in the center.”

NeuV is just a concept, Honda stresses, and there’s no sense of whether it’s intended for production or when. The car has a lot of tech that Honda is working on for production vehicles and likely eventual deployment, but for now it’s just a glimpse at what could be, given the state of advances in AI and other transportation tech.
It’s also interesting that NeuV is making its debut at CES along with Concept-i, Toyota’s concept vehicle that also has an AI onboard, and where Ford debuted Alexa in its own vehicles. Sounds like a future where cars also pack on-board assistants is inevitable.

626,Ford’s going to put Alexa in cars starting later this year,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/04/fords-going-to-put-alexa-in-cars-starting-later-this-year/,2017/01/04," 



A lot of car makers are building Alexa skills for their vehicles, but these tend to be about making it possible for car owners to do things like turn on their cars from inside their homes via their Echo devices. Ford and Amazon are building an Alexa integration that goes the other way, providing car-to-home voice control with Alexa embedded in Ford’s SYNC 3 infotainment system.
The Alexa integration is “the most comprehensive ever in a vehicle,” according to Ford’s press release announcing the news. Available skills via Alexa will allow drivers to do things like play and push playback of audiobooks and music, as well as do things they can’t do at home, like ask for specific local destinations and have those waypoints transferred to their in-car navigation system.
Ford and Amazon share a belief around voice as an interface mode for consumers, and in the car the potential for voice-based interaction is higher, if anything, because it can help with distraction and make it easier to stay focused on the task of driving.

Alexa in the car is set to start rolling out to users sometime around this summer, Ford says. It will offer Alexa conveniences that users are used to, including easy ways to add items to shopping lists or find out about the weather. Amazon is controlling the Alexa side of the experience, and programming its integration with an eye to building a version of the service that’s even more optimally suited for in-car use.
Ford had actually shown off the Alexa integration as a technical proof of concept at CES last year, but now it’s actually in beta testing with Ford employees ahead of its planned wider rollout later this year. I’m a huge Alexa fan, and I’ve long thought it’s the perfect experience for use in-car. In person, Ford’s demo of the tech worked well and did seem to make it a lot easier to ask for and get usable transit directions than is generally true of in-car voice-powered navigation.

The extent to which Alexa can replicate or even improve upon its performance in the home will depend a lot on what kind of feature set It has once it launches vs. the Echo-based version. If most of its functionality makes the cut, it could be great – I’d love to be able to tap into my Harmony skill to set up my home theater experience for a good Netflix binge session while I’m pulling into the driveway, for instance.
Alexa will also work from your Echo devices at home to control Ford vehicles, starting with Ford Focus Electric, Fusion Energy and C-MAX Energi cars, and all of those features will be available mush sooner – that’s coming later this month, letting you do things like start and stop your car or lock your doors from the comfort of your home via voice commands.
Ford tells me this is “just the start” relative to the partnership and their plans for expanding voice-based interaction and virtual assistants in the car.

627,Nvidia and Audi aim to bring a self-driving AI car to market by 2020,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/04/nvidia-and-audi-aim-to-bring-a-self-driving-ai-car-to-market-by-2020/,2017/01/04,"
Nvidia announced several new partners for its efforts to bring autonomous cars to public roads in a production capacity today, but the biggest by far was Audi. Nvidia is working with the carmaker to bring its AI driving tech, which is available thanks to its latest in-car autonomous computing hardware and software, to market by 2020.
Nvidia’s partnership with Audi is not entirely new – the companies have been working together for 10 years, though obviously not on autonomous tech for all that time. The Nvidia team up is ambitious, however, in terms of its timeline, with the aim of getting Level 4 autonomy (full self-driving, with manual driving options) available by 2020.
Audi already has an autonomous test car here at CES this year – it’s a Q7 with AI on board that has been trained for only four days, but is already driving itself competently. Nvidia’s pitch with AI in the car is that its deep learning capability can enable this kind of fast ramp; other methods aren’t as likely to generate these kinds of quick leaps in proficiency.
Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang noted on stage that this self-driving Audi is demonstrating skill “not end of this year, not end of next year – right now,” which is indeed quite a feat for a vehicle with that short of a training period. Most of the test cars in operation at CES have been trained for far longer on their test routes.
The AI system that Nvidia talked about at CES is based on its new Xavier computing platform, which enabled autonomous driving, but also its new AI-based Co-Pilot, which can help with interim levels of autonomy through features including facial recognition and gaze tracking.
This might be the most substantial claim in terms of a firm timeline for delivering highly automated driving, with a roadmap that relies on tested automotive-grade production computing platform, so it is huge news.

628,Roll your own car sharing service with Vulog,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/04/roll-your-own-car-sharing-service-with-vulog/,2017/01/04,"
Vulog is not a big name in the car sharing space, especially in the US, but the French company is hoping to change that at CES 2017. Alexandre Thibault, VP of business development, said it’s the only independent company that provides hardware and software solutions to car sharing services. (The better-known free-floating car sharing services, car2go and ReachNow, are owned by Daimler and BMW, respectively.) Vulog started R&D in 2005, before the iPhone’s debut, and its technology has been deployed in car sharing services for the past three years.
It’s partly been a deliberate decision to fly under the radar. Thibault said in an interview as we drove up the Strip in Las Vegas that many of Vulog’s partners want to brand their services with their own brands. Vulog provides the means to make car sharing happen — back-end fleet management software, in-car hardware, apps, or any mix that meets the clients’ needs — but the providers run the services.
The company has thousands of vehicles using its technology, mostly in Europe and Canada so far. Its most recent deployment was with the new Emov service in Madrid. It launched on December 15, 2016 with 500 electric Citroens in the fleet, and by early January 2017, there were already 40,000 users in the city.
Vulog works with organizations that want to share vehicles but aren’t themselves car makers. The city of Montreal has been working with Vulog for some time on its electric and hybrid car sharing service, Communauto, and Evo in Vancouver, BC, has a fleet of 1000 vehicles using Vulog’s technology. Thibault noted that real estate agents and energy companies are also candidates for a shared fleet using this system.
While Vulog can provide its technology and data security and then get out of the way of the providers, it does need organizations that are contemplating car sharing to know that Vulog exists. The mashup of automotive and technology companies at CES in recent years means companies like Vulog have a chance at finding a toehold in the US market here.
Correction: ReachNow is owned by BMW, but the car sharing platform used by the service is provided by RideCell, another independent company that works with OEMs on their Mobility as a Service projects.

629,Delphi’s self-driving car takes us on a stress-free tour of Las Vegas,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/04/delphis-self-driving-car-takes-us-on-a-stress-free-tour-of-las-vegas/,2017/01/04," 



Delphi has been coming to CES for 21 years as of this year, the company’s CTO Jeffery Owens told me on Tuesday before we embarked on a short tour of downtown Las Vegas aboard an Audi equipped with Delphi’s latest self-driving tech. In the beginning, Delphi had to work pretty hard to get its automaker partners to pay attention to its efforts to push vehicle tech forward, but now it’s in good company at CES, with automakers coming from far and wide to scout out the future of cars.
The Delphi autonomous demo automobile this year is an Audi equipped with a range of tech that carmakers are sure to find appealing, given the intense and growing interest in autonomous and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Working with Mobileye, Delphi has integrated optical cameras and image processing tech from Mobileye pretty seamlessly throughout the car’s exterior, along with LiDAR and radar sensors. The optical sensor output actually exceeds the car’s needs, Owens explains, but that’s useful in a prototype like this one, and the cameras now handle about as much sensory data gathering as the LiDAR and radar arrays, giving a much higher resolution final fused sensory picture.

More data is useful not just for helping to make sure the car pays attention to what it’s supposed to, but also helping to make sure it can more accurately evaluate what isn’t worth its time. There’s far more extraneous data than pertinent info in your average city drive, for instance. And all of this is handled by computers that boast ample processing power, onboard the vehicle.
Those computers are also improved on the test vehicle that Mobileye brought to CES — and perhaps most impressively, the computers are also near impossible to spot. Typical testing vehicles demonstrating self-driving capabilities have essentially no cargo space in the trunk, as it’s taken up by stacks of powerful processing units. Not so in the Delphi Audi, which has enough trunk space to easily handle a heavy haul of groceries.
It’s weird to talk about having a standard trunk as a feature, but for a car that drove as smoothly as Delphi’s vehicle did without a human controlling it, it’s actually a really big deal. Delphi’s car also managed to handle with aplomb impolite drivers cutting in, but without feeling like it was overly erring on the side of caution. It felt, in short, like a good driver was behind the wheel, which is exactly what you’d want.

Delphi also uses Road Experience Management tech from Mobileye, which is basically a crowdsourced, constantly updated map of the roads that uses input from any vehicles equipped with Mobileye’s sensors. That info populates Delphi’s visual representation of what’s on the road, along with input from the car sensors, and connected infrastructure signals, like traffic lights telling the car when the lights will change.
The drive system that Delphi showed us works very well on the Las Vegas roads, but to some extent that’s to be expected, because it’s a course it’s run fairly often. But Delphi says we still have a while before its ships — the company is looking at 2019 for a production-ready system, which means actually in cars going off dealer lots by 2020 or 2021.

630,Toyota’s Concept-i is a vehicle designed to learn about its driver,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/04/toyotas-concept-i-is-a-vehicle-designed-to-learn-about-its-driver/,2017/01/04,"
Toyota revealed the Concept-i at CES on Wednesday, a new concept vehicle that the company built with its Newport Beach CALTY design research group, with tech supplied by the carmaker’s SF-based innovation hub. I spoke to CALTY Project Design Manager William Chergosky about the process of creating Concept-i, which he said was about finding a way to bring the excitement people feel about driving now to a potential future in which autonomous driving is much more prevalent.
“We’ve been working on this for approximately two years, and we’re trying to create a futuristic vision for the 2030 automobile that’s really fun to drive,” Chergosky explained. “As everyone’s moving towards an autonomous future, what’s Toyota’s vision of that? We had a real fundamental belief in this idea of ‘waku-doki’ – getting your heart racing. Is that something that dies with this future? I don’t think it is.”

A big part of achieving that comes down to user experience design, according to Chergosky, which is why the Concept-i pays close attention to how the car greets the user, and how it signals a shift from manual to autonomous driving mode. LED lights across the body and throughout the interior cue the driver about their driving experience, setting the tone for either method of control.
“Our fundamental idea behind it was trying to humanize or warm up the technology, and make it more approachable,” he said. “The idea of trying to humanize it is to try to narrow that gap between you and the technology […] it’s a participant.”

To do this, they took the idea of “kinetic warmth” as a core guiding principle in designing the Concept-i, which meant establishing something that felt at once alive and technically capable. That’s why Toyota placed an AI at the center of the in-car experience, which it dubbed ‘Yui’ (you-EE). This virtual companion is designed to get to know you as a driver and as a person, and to adapt its behavior in order to best provide that “waku-doki” that Toyota aims for – that spirit of driving excitement.
An AI provides some unique advantages in terms of achieving this; it can actually learn what that kind of experience means for you as an individual driver, instead of relying on some generalized concept. And as mentioned, CALTY was also hoping to disintermediate the experience of using a car with autonomous tech on board by giving the vehicle a real personality, expressed by Yui via dashboard, interior and exterior light, sound, even haptic feedback.
Yui also addresses a key area of focus for autonomous driving and making it viable on real roads: Communicating with pedestrians and other vehicles. Through Concept-i’s exterior lighting system, Yui can tell others whether it’s in manual or autonomous drive mode, greet drivers or passengers approaching the car and notify drivers behind about upcoming road hazards or turns.
Concept-i and Yui are both very much still concepts, which means what eventually makes it to production from Toyota in a self-driving future could look very different. But it’s an interesting exploration of some of the remaining challenges we face as drivers staring down the onrush of autonomous vehicles.

Intel already has a dedicated functional group targeting the automotive industry, and now it also has sub-brand devoted to all things car tech. The Go brand covers products including in-vehicle automated driving development platforms, a 5G communication platform that’s intended to help carmakers get ready for broader rollout of 5G wireless tech in 2020, and an SDK aimed at helping developers in the automated driving field take advantage of new computing and sensor hardware.
Go, and its three product lines, are making their official debut at CES 2017 on Wednesday, and put some more definition on Intel’s plan to position itself in a key role as autonomous driving continues to gain traction. Intel also announced a test fleet deployment partnership with BMW and Mobileye Wednesday morning, and those test vehicles will indeed carry Intel Go platforms on board, according to the chipmaker.
The new 5G deployment platform is also very interesting, because it paves the way for connective not only between vehicles, but also between cars and infrastructure, with wireless network advances that drastically improve latency and speed, which are both key ingredients when you’re talking about communication tech that’s used to help inform split-section decisions a car’s autonomous navigation systems are using to potentially avoid accidents.
Intel’s Automated Driving Group (ADG) will likely be a big contributor to Go’s development, but it sounds like Go might be even more broad-reaching as the silicon giant looks to make the most out of the car industry’s increasing reliance on tech.

632,"ZF debuts ProAI, a production self-driving system based on Nvidia’s Drive PX 2",https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/04/zf-debuts-proai-a-production-self-driving-system-based-on-nvidias-drive-px-2/,2017/01/04,"
Tier 1 auto supplier ZF just launched ProAI at CES, a production self-driving system that uses the Drive PX 2 AI computing platform created by Nvidia. The Drive PX 2 was announced last year at CES, with the company describing the in-car compute platform as a “supercomputer in a lunchbox” because of its unmatched processing power and size. The PX 2 has roughly the equivalent computing power of around 150 MacBook Pros, as noted by Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang at the time.
ProAi, ZF’s product, is the first use of Drive PX 2 in a production system, and uses Nvidia’s AutoCruise configuration of the platform, which uses just one Parker system-on-a-chip. ProAi is targeting companies doing self-driving cars and trucks, but also industrial vehicles like forklifts. The key to all of these is AI, according to Nvidia, which is why tis platform made sense to ZF.
ZF ProAi’s system also employs vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, so that it can share info not only with connected infrastructure but also with other cars, and even achieve what ZF calls “swarm intelligence,” allowing cars or vehicles connected to one another to learn as a group instead of having to adapt to challenges individually.
ProAi will take into from multiple cameras, LiDAR, radar and ultrasonics sensors to inform its AI-based understand of the driving conditions it encounters and do its route planning. ZF will be doing automotive grade certification of the platform, and plans to start bringing it to production beginning in 2018.

633,A ride in the Lucid Motors alpha prototype,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/04/a-ride-in-the-lucid-motors-alpha-prototype/,2017/01/04,"
Lucid Motors brought its alpha prototype of its first production luxury EV to CES 2017. There’s a small fleet of these early test cars, but the one that made it to Las Vegas is the one in full camouflage. “We wanted it to be like the dazzle ships in World War I,” said Lucid CTO Peter Rawlinson. Then he pointed out that the camo is actually the word Lucid exploded across the side of the car.
Lucid sets itself apart from its competitors in a couple of ways. It began in 2007 as a battery technology company, which is how it raised Series A funding. Then it expanded to encompass electric drivetrains and raised Series B funding in 2011. Then in 2014, it received Series C funding to create a luxury EV.
The result is a vehicle that has been designed from the ground-up to maximize the space that an electric powertrain allows. It has the same exterior size, roughly, as a Mercedes E-class, while inside it’s more like an S-class with a long wheelbase, Rawlinson said. During the test drive, a six-foot-six man sat in the back seat with loads of space to spare.
Thanks to Lucid’s development history, the car will have a 300-mile range, with the option to up that to around 400 miles. The key, Rawlinson said, was Lucid’s breakthrough technology that allows the batteries to be repeatedly charged at high-powered fast chargers and not degrade as quickly as competitors’ systems.
Speaking of competitors, Rawlinson was clear on who the company was targeting, and it’s not Tesla. Lucid has Audi, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz in its sights. “The business model works for luxury vehicles,” Rawlinson said. “Our first product will define us and define the brand.”
Part of that definition is 1000 hp from two motors, front and back, and an expected 0-60 mph time around 2.5 seconds. Rawlinson whipped around the back streets of Las Vegas, chirping tires with the torque and racing to the stop signs before hitting the brakes. There was power to spare and track-worthy handling, though the interior was as bare-bones as it could be.
Lucid will build the vehicles in Arizona and launch in the US, but it will quickly expand to Asian and then European markets. The car will meet all safety and legislative requirements around the world, Rawlinson said, meaning the company only has to build one car for the global market.
The prototype is 90-95% ready for production. One of the hangups that is causing heated debate at Lucid HQ, according to design VP Derek Jenkins, is the charging standard. Do they use SAE, CHAdeMO,or a proprietary system a la Tesla? Or a combination? Or include one standard as standard equipment with the option to choose another?
“A lot of companies are exploring the potential of EVs, but not a lot are successful,” Rawlinson said. “They totally underestimate the enormity of this task.” He acknowledges that Tesla has made starting a car company look easy, but he has confidence that with Lucid’s history and team of experts, as well as the agreement to manufacture in Casa Grande, AZ, that the first cars will be ready for consumers in 2019.

634,Taking a ride in Hyundai’s driverless car at CES 2017,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/04/taking-a-ride-in-hyundais-driverless-car-at-ces-2017/,2017/01/04,"
Hyundai’s driverless Ioniq pulls up smoothly up to pick up me and TC’s Rebecca Friedman – though a driver is actually in the cockpit at this point, controlling the vehicle, so its performance is hardly noteworthy. But on the outside, the Hyundai Ioniq hybrid vehicle is equally lacking in distinguishing traits – beyond the body wrap emblazoned with Ioniq autonomous branding, it looks like a regular production car.
As we settle into the back seat, it’s apparent something is different. The vehicle has two rear-mounted displays that mirror a third in the center console between the driver’s seat and the front passenger. All three of these screens (iPads, if you’re curious) show vehicle passengers a simplified information display representing the car, its basic surroundings, current speed – and a steering wheel icon that lets you know, somewhat ironically, when there’s no need for a human to be using said wheel.
The drive began with the human safety driver taking us out onto Las Vegas’ Paradise Road, but once we’d merged into traffic he turned on the autonomous system and took his hands off the wheel. The course was a short, roughly 1 mile loop, and we could track our progress on the display. Unlike in a lot of demo autonomous cars, this display, with its polished graphical representation of the car and its progress, seemed almost production-ready for a real consumer.

And the autonomous system also performed in a way that almost felt ready for regular drivers and real roads – almost. The system remained engaged throughout the first half of the drive, handling turns and stops with relative ease. But the car began rolling backwards ever so slowly while we were stopped on an incline in traffic, leading to the only slightly tense moment of the drive, as we did get close to the car behind. The safety driver had to take over manual control to get us past the light, but once he resumed the autonomous driving mode, it proceeded uneventfully for the remainder of the trip.
Hyundai’s approach to autonomy focuses on leveraging things like detailed maps, to supplement a lighter sensor load out and reduce costs both for producer and consumer. It likely is playing with a very detailed and well-trod picture of the route it’s running for demos at CES this year, the one we experienced, but it was still impressive barring the one time the driver needed to take over.

And we’re still in early days for Hyundai’s autonomous tech – the company is hoping to get everything in its sensor package ready to roll by 2021, but production might not begin until sometime after that pending regulatory progress and customer appetite for driverless tech.

635,Tesla’s Gigafactory starts mass producing battery cells,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/04/teslas-gigafactory-starts-mass-producing-battery-cells/,2017/01/04,"
Tesla’s massive Nevada Gigafactory has started producing lithium-ion battery cells in mass capacity, with the aim of supplying products including the upcoming Model 3 electric vehicle and the Powerwall 2 home energy supply unit, and the Powerpack 2 commercial solar energy storage product. It’s a big step for the automaker, since production volume of the batteries it produces with partner Panasonic will be a key choke point in terms of ramping production and making good on Model 3 delivery timelines.
The Gigafactory officially held its grand opening last year, but its focus thus far has been on assembling prior products like the original Powerwall, and preparing the facility for production of next-gen products at scale; Panasonic and Tesla’s new jointly designed cylindrical 2170 cells in particular, which is aimed at optimizing performance for cost in a form factor that can be used both at home and in vehicles. Production of the 2170 for qualification, which is to say for testing and quality assurance purposes ahead of mass production, started in December.
Starting today, cells made in the Gigafactory will be used in production Powerwall 2 and Powerpack 2 unit, and the aim is to start building battery cells destined for Model 3 cars starting in the second quarter of 2017. Tesla says it aims to have capacity ramped to the point where its production of lithium-ion cells tops 35 GWh/year, which is almost at the current electric battery production capacity of all the world’s suppliers combined.
While the Gigafactory is operational, it is far from complete – the design Tesla used allows it to open different phases for business as construction finishes on each, which is what will help them use it to build production batteries now, but also scale to much greater production capacity over time. At the current stage, the factory is under 30 percent done, yet still manages to occupy 1.9 million square feet, Tesla says, with interior operational space of 4.9 million square feet total because of how it’s using different floors.
The Gigafactory is looking to not only satisfy Tesla’s growing demand in terms of volume, but also drop the individual cost of batteries through se of automated production capacity, and improved processes that will result in fewer units being discarded for defects and failure to meet standards after they’re produced. Tesla also notes that despite its use of highly automated production line tech, the Gigafactory will itself eventually employ 6,500 people directly.
Tesla reported Tuesday that it built 83,922 vehicles across 2016, but delivered 76,230, under its target of 80,000 for the year. It cited missed shipping cut-offs and also production challenges caused by the shift to Tesla HW2 sensor packages in Model X and S vehicles, which changes the sensor and on-board computing load out to pave the way for eventual introduction of full self-driving features. Still, boosted battery production will definitely contribute to Tesla being able to meet its goals in the future.

636,"BMW, Intel and Mobileye will put 40 self-driving test cars on roads in 2017",https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/04/bmw-intel-and-mobileye-will-put-40-self-driving-test-cars-on-roads-in-2017/,2017/01/04,"
Automaker BMW is teaming up with suppliers Intel and Mobileye to deploy a fleet of test vehicles, numbering 40 in total, targeting a street date of sometime during the second half of 2017. The fleet deployment was announced Wednesday by the three partners at CES, and follows their July announcement of their initial decision to partner.
Between July and now, BMW, Mobileye and Intel have created what they call a “scalable architecture” for autonomous driving, with the aim of making something that can be adopted by other developers working in the automotive space, and even by other carmakers. The scalability comes because the system can be used either as discreet, pick-and-choose modules at the most basic level, to an entire end-to-end autonomous driving system that leaves only user and product experience design to individual brands and potential clients.
BMW says that this test will occur “globally under real traffic conditions,” so it’s likely the 40 vehicles will be deployed across more than one site. Intel’s Brian Krzanich explained in a press release that the chipmaker is seeing benefits in terms of speed of development and cost by teaming up with others like Mobileye and BMW to share the collective load of bringing autonomous systems to market.
As you might expect, Intel is offering the computing component for this new joint platform, while BMW is handling “driving control and dynamics,” as well as safety validation, and Mobileye is doing computer vision processing and sensors, though its working with BMW on the sensor fusion model. BMW is targeting use of autonomous tech in its iNEXT model for 2021, but the joint partnership is looking to start rolling out hardware samples for the platform along with software updates across the next few years.
Another entrant joining the real-world autonomous testing mix in 2017 is hardly surprising, but the combined talents of these three partners could make this a strong contender as a turn-key solution for smaller companies who want to mine the turn towards self-driving but don’t have the resources or time to build a system on their own.

637,Ford and Toyota launch consortium to help developers build in-car apps,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/03/ford-and-toyota-team-up-to-launch-the-smartdevicelink-consortium/,2017/01/03,"
Drivers expect their cars and smartphones to seamlessly work together. Both Apple and Google offer their respective services for connecting phones to a car’s infotainment system, but the car industry isn’t ready to completely cede the center console to Silicon Valley. Ford and Toyota have long been unlikely allies in this area. A few years ago, with AppLink, Ford started giving a select number of mobile app developers the ability to integrate their smartphone apps with its Sync infotainment system. It then open-sourced it under the SmartDeviceLink moniker back in 2013 and Toyota was one of the first third-party car manufacturers to adopt it for its cars.
Now the two companies have launched the SmartDeviceLink (SDL) Consortium to continue the development of this technology. In addition to Ford and Toyota, Mazda, PSA Group, Fuji Heavy Industries and Suzuki are joining the group. Other members include Elektrobit, Luxoft and Xevo, while Harman and QNX have signed Letters of Intent to join the group.
When Ford first open-sourced SmartDeviceLink, it donated the technology to the GENIVI Alliance. If you look at the GENIVI Alliance’s homepage today, though, you won’t find Ford or Toyota as members. “Previously, GENIVI may not have been the most neutral body in the world,” David Hatton, Ford’s global manager of mobile application, told me when I asked about what happened. Indeed, as Doug VanDagens, Ford’s representative on the SDL Consortium’s board, noted numerous times during our conversation, the group aims to give all the members a voice but remain neutral. That, too, is one of the reasons the companies decided to set up their own governing structure instead of going to the Linux Foundation or a similar organization for help. “Neither Ford nor Toyota nor individual OEMs will have a controlling influence,” he added, and noted that the consortium itself is truly agnostic as to how OEMs build SDL into their cars and products.
The SDL Consortium will host its code on GitHub and will take contributions from anybody (though the technical committee will then evaluate all those changes before accepting new code, of course). In the end, though, it’s up to the individual car manufacturers and OEMs to perform their own tests (the consortium will only perform the basic validations) and manage their own developer programs. So while developers will be able to write one app that will then run in all SDL compatible cars, it’s up to the manufacturers and OEMs to decide what that integration will look like in the car. SDL doesn’t prescribe what the actual user experience in the car looks like, for example.
VanDagens and Hatton believe this is what the car manufacturers are looking for. While Ford, for example, offers support for SDL, Android Auto and Apple’s CarPlay (because that’s what drivers want), it and other car manufacturers would surely prefer a world in which they remain in control.
For developers, this consortium opens up the possibility that the apps they write for SDL will now be supported by a far larger number of cars in the long run. Similarly, for the car manufacturers involved, that means they can invest in a single platform and (maybe) keep pace with the innovations coming out of Cupertino and Mountain View.
Hatton tells me that the consortium has already worked out a roadmap of new features that will soon come to SDL. These include voice passthrough, for example, as well as improved wireless projection and deeper integration with mobile navigation services, but also new features to add more intelligence to the car that will, in Hatton’s words, make for a “richer driving experience.”

639,Look out for Ultrahaptics haptic feedback in new cars this year,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/03/ultrahaptics-launching/,2017/01/03,"Haptic controls: No amount of photos can make them look good. Try it out, though: It’s a little bit like magic. If you look closely, you can see the Leap Motion that’s being used for the hand tracking. The haptic feedback comes from the ultrasonic array immediately below the Leap Motion.

Since Ultrahaptics was founded in 2013, the company has showed off a string of better and better technical demos. Which has been fun, but obviously where the rubber really hits the road (pun most emphatically intended) is when the products start showing up in the real world. 2017 may just prove to be the year that happens.
Underneath all the car-porn, Bosch’s products usually give a heads-up of what’s to come in the near future
Cars, perhaps more than in any other market, is where haptic feedback interfaces make the most sense. Car makers love the flexibility of touch screens; it means you don’t have to figure out what every button does and where it goes in the long production cycles of automobiles. You carve out a big slab of space to fit a screen, and the software guys do the rest. Makes sense; this is the exact same approach that means you can use your smartphone for a billion different things, rather than just sending SMS messages, making phone calls and playing snake. There’s a problem with touch screens, though. A big one. You can’t operate them without looking at the screen. Which is a really, really bad idea when you’re barreling down the road at 70 miles per hour in 3,000 lbs worth of steel and glass. Which brings us back to haptic interfaces.
An interface that gives you all the feels
A few weeks ago, BMW showed off the HoloActive haptic interface. It’s part of a concept car that will give you a whiff of what cars might be up to a decade from now, so who knows if that turns up next year, 20 years from now, or, oh, I don’t know, never. That’s the way of concept cars. A much more certain route to market is when large OEM suppliers start showing off technology. And that’s why a demo car from Bosch caught my attention at CES. It may just be the springboard that will catapult the Bristol-based Ultrahaptics from the relative obscurity of entertaining technical demos, to the shiny, sparkly stratosphere of real-world use.
The demonstration of the haptic feedback system at Ultrahaptics’ stand at CES. In the image, you can see the Leap Motion the company is using for tracking. Not pictured: The invisible haptic feedback that’s the actual magic sauce in this setup.
If you’re not a car aficionado, it’s possible you only know Bosch for their wiper blades. That’s cool, but whatever the logo on the front of your car, chances are your car contains more than a few parts from the German equipment manufacturer. The company makes all sorts of clever bits and pieces for cars, including ABS systems, electronics, engine injection systems and much more. It’s fair to see Bosch as the over-sized parts bin that car manufacturers pick from when they design their next-generation cars.
As part of Bosch’s CES Show Car, the company is showing off two fun new technologies that is making it easier to interact with your car without taking your eyes off the road. One is a production-ready version of neoSense, which is designed to aid drivers touchscreen “buttons” by touch.

The second technology is a haptic gesture control system. It uses Ultrahaptics’ technology to give feedback to the driver. Instead of having to touch a screen, drivers can simply move their hand in the air. The sensors “see” the hand and by using ultrasound technology, the driver can “feel” the controls. Imagine swiping to the right to skip to the next track of music, for example, and feeling a little ridge in thin air that signifies that you’ve skipped a track. Or, perhaps a better example, moving your hand up until you feel a tingling sensation signifying the air conditioning controls, before swiping left or right to turn the temperature up or down.
“We’re incredibly excited about how receptive the automotive market has been to Ultrahaptics. Gesture recognition has come a long way in the last few years. It’s now affordable for a whole range of different markets and applications,” Ultrahaptics’ CEO Steve Cliffe told me. “With its growing popularity the need for haptics has become more and more obvious. Now for the first time, with Ultrahaptics’ technology, gesture recognition is completed with the sense of touch in mid-air.”
Both Ultrahaptics and Bosch are extraordinarily tight-lipped about which (if any) car manufacturers are spooling up the use of the technology in cars, but I have it on good authority that we will see this in production cars sooner rather than later.
Haptic controls are undoubtedly going to take a bit of getting used to, but if it helps keep drivers’ eyes on the road, I’m all for it. Definitely one to keep an eye out for.

640,"Qualcomm kicks its automotive ambitions up another gear, partners with VW and more",https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/03/qualcomm-kicks-its-automotive-ambitions-up-another-gear-partners-with-vw-and-more/,2017/01/03,"
While Qualcomm continues to work on closing its $47 billion acquisition of automotive chipmaker NXP, it’s also driving ahead with developing car technology on its own steam. Today at CES, the chipmaker unveiled several initiatives to drive further into the connected car space, including a partnership with Volkswagen, a connected car trial in Germany, a new class of high-bandwidth, Gigabit LTE for vehicles, and more.
As Patrick Little, Qualcomm’s SVP and GM for automotive tech, described it, the company is looking to develop end-to-end car technology for the next generation of connected vehicles. “There are three aspects to connected car processing technology: sense, think and act,” he said in a short interview with TechCrunch today at CES after the company’s press event earlier today. “NXP is really good at the ‘sense’ and ‘act’ parts, and we’re building the ‘think’ part.”
Here’s a short run-down of what Qualcomm is building in the automotive space:
Vehicle-to-everything connectivity field trial: Qualcomm is working with Audi, Ericsson SWARCO Traffic Systems and the University of Kaiserslautern on a new consortium called the Connected Vehicle to Everything of Tomorrow (ConVeX). This will be focused on building a cellular-V2X (C-V2X) trial to explore ways of connecting Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P). This is less about autonomous vehicles and more about simply making cars work “like phones” in terms of their seamless connectivity, Little explained.
Gigabit LTE class for cars. Little told me that these days “a very high quality connection is the top priority right now” for automakers, and this new class of LTE, he said, would essentially make the Internet connection speeds in your vehicle just as fast as those in your home (that’s assuming you are not a customer of Comcast… ;-) ). This new LTE variant reference platform is based on Qualcomm’s Gigabit Class Qualcomm Snapdragon X16 LTE modem and would offer a peak download speeds of up to 1 Gbps. Qualcomm already has a base of customers using 3G/4G LTE modems in connected cars, so this will be about upgrading existing carmakers, as well as snagging new ones. “We work with everyone who is working in automotive right now,” Little told me.
Volkswagen infotainment systems. Volkswagen is making a lot of moves to position itself in the market for new cars, launching a new brand, Moia, to move beyond some of its recent scandals to focus on the future. It looks like Qualcomm will be working on it at least for part of that, by integrating its 820 chipsets and modems into Volkswagen vehicles to power the streaming for its in-car entertainment and information systems. Again, as with the LTE Gigabit news, this is about creating in-car systems that work as well as our best smartphones and mobile networks work. Today, this may be a service reserved for high-end vehicles, but many automakers believe that it will become ubiquitous enough that good and reliable in-car systems will be table stakes.

641,Intel confirms 15% stake in mapping business Here to work on autonomous car tech,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/03/intel-confirms-a-15-stake-in-mapping-business-here/,2017/01/03,"
Here, the mapping and location services company once owned by Nokia and sold for €2.5 billion to a car-maker consortium of Audi, BMW and Daimler in 2015, is picking up a new investor today. Chipmaker Intel has confirmed that it is taking a 15 percent stake in the business, which it will use to develop autonomous positioning systems (powered with Intel Inside).
The companies are not disclosing the value of the stake, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017. At Here’s sale price in 2015, the stake would be worth $390 million in today’s currency.
“Cars are rapidly becoming some of the world’s most intelligent, connected devices,” said Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO, in a statement. “We look forward to working with HERE and its automotive partners to deliver an important technology foundation for smart and connected cars of the future.”
“A real-time, self-healing and high definition representation of the physical world is critical for autonomous driving, and achieving this will require significantly more powerful and capable in-vehicle compute platforms,” said Edzard Overbeek, Here CEO, in a statement. “As a premier silicon provider, Intel can help accelerate HERE’s ambitions in this area by supporting the creation of a universal, always up-to-date digital location platform that spans the vehicle, the cloud and everything else connected.”
The news follows a morning of speculation after it was reported that Intel had applied to Germany’s Cartel Office to approve the investment. It comes about a week after Singapore’s GIC, Tencent and NavInfo together agreed to take a 10% stake of Here. (That was a deal that was months and months in the making: NavInfo and Tencent had been in the running to acquire Here outright before the car consortium acquired it.)
Here is also working closely with Microsoft, which acquired other parts of Nokia and has been in an extended licensing agreement for location data as part of that transaction.
This is Intel’s latest — but not first — investment in automotive. Cars are a big area for the chipmaker as it looks to make sure that it has a place at the table for its processors in the next generation of computing devices, and connected cars have shaped up to be one of the chief targets. This week, the auto industry will especially be in the spotlight because of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas — where cars have been growing in prominence as the “gadget of tomorrow” alongside computers, phones, washing machines, and more.
Intel’s other auto moves have included acquiring Itseez and Yogitech for safety and navigation functionalities in autonomous cars; a commitment of at least $250 million to the space; keeping a strong presence at auto shows, and in November launching a dedicated autonomous driving group. (Doug Davis, who heads that group, will now sit on Here’s board.)
With the Here investment, the plan is to design and deliver proof-of-concept architecture to improve driving safety and predictability.
Part of this will be to raise the accuracy of mapping data on Here: Today, locations can be mapped to an accuracy of of meters but the aim is to bring that down to centimeters in HD mapping technology — essential in self-driving systems where cars are navigating themselves on roads and needing to be more precise with their positioning in real-time.
Part of the deal will also include Intel working with Here’s other majority owners, Audi, BMW and Daimler to test its architecture. Intel and Here both say
Intel will also work with AUDI AG, BMW AG and Daimler AG to test the architecture, it said, and eventually offer it to other carmakers. “Intel and HERE envision making the architecture broadly available across the automotive industry as a seamlessly integrated offering that simplifies and shortens time of development for automakers.”

642,Hyundai links up with Google Assistant for car voice commands,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/03/hyundai-links-up-with-google-assistant-for-car-voice-commands/,2017/01/03,"
Hyundai will team with Google to make its cars voice-operable to a limited degree via Assistant, the search giant’s virtual helper. Hyundai is showing off this tech at CES this year, which allows Hyundai vehicle owners to do things like ask Google to start their car, transfer an address to their vehicle or lock the doors.
The integration works via Hyundai’s Blue Link software, which you tell Google Assistant to interact with in order to control connected features on the cars. It’s similar to how car companies, including Hyundai, are working with Echo and Amazon Alexa, and it’s primarily designed to be accessed via Google Home. It also requires that a Hyundai car owner provide Google Assistant with their Blue Link PIN to ensure they actually have the authority to control the vehicle.
Other controls possible via the connection include operating the horn and lights, stopping and resuming charging of Hyundai plug-ins and more. The Home service isn’t yet in production, but should come to compatible vehicles soon.

643,Ford to build new all-electric SUV and autonomous hybrid at Michigan plant,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/03/ford-to-build-new-all-electric-suv-and-autonomous-hybrid-at-michigan-plant/,2017/01/03,"
Ford has announced plans at CES to build a range of new electric and hybrid-electric vehicles, revealing plans for seven of its total 13 planned electric cars set for arrival in the next five years. These include a brand-new, fully electric small SUV, and a new fully autonomous car that will be the basis of its new electric ride-hailing fleet, with a target debut date of 2021.
The new Ford vehicles will be built at the carmaker’s Flat Rock, Michigan plant, as part of a planned expansion of that facility with a $700 million investment. This will come at the cost of a $1.6 billion planned Mexico plant project, which Ford is also cancelling as announced today.
Ford’s new vehicle plans also include a hybrid F-150, targeting 2020 for availability as is the new all-electric truck, and a hybrid Mustang, also destined for the Flat Rock facility and aiming for 2020. Other vehicles include a plug-in Transit Custom, and hybrid cars designed for police use, which are going to be built in Chicago.
Ford’s planned vehicles will use Ford’s next-generation EV tech, which enters testing this year. It’s also going to debut a range of new services that are designed to help ease the transition to EVs for drivers and take away headaches related to things like charging.
The most interesting part of this announcement might be the specific plans for Ford’s new autonomous vehicle fleet. Ford says it’s targeting “high-volume” production for this car, which makes sense if it indeed wants to deploy the cars en masse to service dense urban environments where car ownership is on the decline.

644,GM counters Trump’s Twitter claim about Chevy Cruze being made in Mexico,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/03/gm-counters-trumps-twitter-claim-about-chevy-cruze-being-made-in-mexico/,2017/01/03,"
On Tuesday morning, Donald Trump tweeted that the Chevrolet Cruze sold in the U.S. is being manufactured in Mexico and sold tax-free via dealers across the border in the U.S. GM responded to the claim with a statement clarifying exactly where it makes the Cruze it retails in the U.S., which it turns out is primarily in Ohio.
All Cruze sedans sold in the U.S. are made at a factory in the state, GM notes, and while some Chevrolet Cruze hatchbacks designed for the global market are sold stateside, and are in fact made in Mexico, the vast majority of those vehicles are destined for export to other international markets.
It’s not the first time Trump has seen fit to intervene in the manufacturing location choices of American companies; he previously announced a deal with Carrier to keep some of the air conditioner company’s jobs in the U.S., though it’s not yet a done deal and the details are being kept mostly in the dark.
Trump’s claim here has a tiny grain of truth, but is clearly a gross overstatement of the facts designed to engender his elaborately constructed image as a savior of U.S. jobs. Cruze is overwhelming selling sedan models in the U.S. market, and as the company confirms, those are exclusively assembled in the Ohio facility.

GM’s full statement:
General Motors manufactures the Chevrolet Cruze sedan in Lordstown, Ohio. All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the U.S. are built in GM’s assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S.

645,Fiat Chrysler’s Portal concept is a van with a plan for autonomous driving,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/02/fiat-chryslers-portal-concept-is-a-van-with-a-plan-for-autonomous-driving/,2017/01/02,"
Fiat Chrysler is getting ready for a future in which your vehicle is an extension of your living space with their new Portal concept car, which is debuting at CES this year. The Portal is an electric-powered vehicle with its own wireless network, Level 3 semi-autonomy standard and the hardware necessary for an upgrade to true Level 4 self-driving capability, and fold-flat/removable seating for flexible interior reconfiguration options.
The van seats six, and is designed to cater to the “millennial lifestyle,” whatever that might mean. Reading between the lines it sounds like it means inexpensive to buy and operate, with enough space inside to move from being a mobile office to being a mobile family playroom as the millennial generation ages into parenthood.

FCA also clearly thinks that this millennial audience values ethical and environmentally friendly materials, since it uses no animal hides in its synthetic leather interior, and also claims over 250 miles of range from its electric powerhouse. Quick charger support for DC Fast Charge tech also means it should be able to recoup 150 miles of range in under 20 minutes of being plugged in.
Another key ingredient here is the lighting system, which it says is not “a mere accent” in the case of the Portal. The big sliding doors have illuminated surrounds to show you where to get in and out, and the front lights, side panels and rear all feature LED lights than can change to reflect a full spectrum of hues. These can also animate, and be customized to display different signals based on a user’s preference. Communicative light arrays are increasingly common on future-focused concepts like this one, since they’ll be a key ingredient in communicating a car’s intended path and behavior in a self-driving future where pedestrians regularly encounter these vehicles.

The car is also fitted throughout with docking stations for tablets and smartphones, and it’s designed kind of like an upgradeable DIY entertainment system extension. These are peppered throughout the interior, and should extend the life of the vehicle’s onboard entertainment and information display systems since users presumably will update their mobile devices much more frequently than they update their vehicles.
Portal also contains facial recognition and voice printing to help it set in-car features like lighting, music, navigation and more to specific drivers and riders; vehicle-to-X (other cars and city infrastructure) communication for advanced contextual safety features, and local community sharing of things like photos, music and video over the internal network.

The van anticipates a time when we use our vehicles more like modular cars on a train than like we do now, where you can bring your own gadgets and use things like the fold-flat seating to change the space quickly and easily depending on your use for the day. It’s a clever look, and a likely candidate for use in shared fleet vehicles systems, which are probably also going to gradually replace individual ownership as the millennial generation ages up.
FCA worked with key suppliers in developing the concept, including Adient for the modular seating, as well as Panasonic and Samsung for in-car connectivity and display. Tech partners are likely to become more important as Tier 1 partners for automakers like Fiat Chrysler as we chug along the path to full autonomy, and the Portal is a good example of what those closer relationships will lead to in vehicle design.

646,Fiat Chrysler and Google team on Android in-car tech,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/02/fiat-chrysler-and-google-team-on-android-in-car-tech/,2017/01/02,"
Fiat Chrysler and Alphabet are already working together via Waymo, the former Google self-driving car project, and now Google is also teaming with the automaker for in-car system tech, using Android as the base for a new infotainment and connect car platform. The new FCA in-car system is called Uconnect, and uses Android 7.0 to deliver a range of features, including Android app compatibility alongside more traditional in-car controls like AC and heat, also with terrestrial radio.
Google’ work with FCA goes well beyond the Android Auto model, which essentially layers on a simplified, driver-friendly and distraction reducing version of Android to an in-car display (or mounted smartphone), powered from the phone itself.  The search giant clearly wants to push further into the dashboard of users, and do so in a way that is more deeply integrated with carmaker software and systems themselves.
“Google is committed to building Android as a turn-key automotive platform that integrates deeply with the vehicle in a safe and seamless way,” said Patrick Brady, Director of Android Engineering, Google in a press release announcing the news.
For the carmaker, Google and Android offer unique flexibility that give them the advantage of being able to offer customers app compatibility, but without having to give up total control of the branding and customer relationship.
“With Android, we are able to maintain our unique and intuitive Uconnect user interface, all while integrating our easy-to-use systems with Android’s features and ecosystem of applications,” noted FCA Head of Electrical Engineering Chris Barman in the release.
This is an advantage that Google has which isn’t available to Apple, which is also seeking to more closely integrate its mobile products into user’s in-car lives via CarPlay. It’s unlikely that Apple would ever cede control over the look and feel of the interface to automakers, since it has never had that kind of relationships with OEMs with either iOS or modern OS X/macOS software.
Arguably, letting automakers maintain responsibility for the look and feel of the in-car software interface isn’t the ideal solution, since they’ve proven clumsy when it comes to UX in the past. But carmakers also face rigorous rules for preventing distraction, and would be unlikely to cede control of interface design entirely to operating system makers anyway, both because of this and their desire to control the customer experience.
Android’s flexibility could prove key to getting it more presence in vehicles heading into a time when the in-car experience becomes something new and valuable, when autonomous vehicles begin to gain ground. I’ll be sure to check out Uconnect while I’m at CES this week, where it’ll be on display, but regardless of the experience, it’s a smart strategic move for Google at this stage.

647,Tesla begins rolling out much-anticipated Autopilot update for its newest cars,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/02/tesla-begins-rolling-out-much-anticipated-autopilot-update-for-its-newest-cars/,2017/01/02,"
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has bold plans for self-driving cars in 2017, and his company took a step towards that goal after it began rolling out a much-anticipated Autopilot update to owners of its newer vehicles.
Unlike older Teslas, vehicles built after October — known as hardware 2, “HW2” — were released initially without the full suite of Autopilot features, which provide advanced semi-autonomous driving for use on highway. That’s because they shipped with different (new) software and hardware which, in the long run, will enable them to be fully self-driving. In the short term, though, this new update, announced by Musk on Twitter on New Year’s Eve, will add a number of a number Autopilot features to the vehicles to get them near on par with older Tesla models.
But, there’s a catch, and the update is only live an initial 1,000 cars. Most owners will need to wait for a wider rollout that Musk said is due within a week.


HW2 Autopilot software uploading to 1000 cars this eve. Will then hold to verify no field issues and upload to rest of fleet next week.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 31, 2016



Musk didn’t go into details of the update, but Electrek reported that the release notes include Autopilot’s Traffic Aware Cruise Control feature, Forward Collision Warning, and Autosteer, although the latter is only enabled at “low-speed.”
Owners of newer the Model S and Model X have had to wait a little, but there’s huge upside to that since their vehicles come with all the sensors and computing power onboard needed to achieve full self-driving once the software is ready. That explains the delay of these Autopilot features too — it’s actually different from the original Autopilot system, and takes advantage of the new on-board computer vision capabilities made possible by the upgraded sensor and computer hardware.
Musk has said that he believes Tesla will be in a position to field test full autonomy by the end of 2017. What we’ve seen of Tesla’s tests have looked impressive so far, and the newer cars will sit near the front of the queue as that technology matures and becomes available to drivers on the road.
But it has been a challenging 2016 for Tesla. An owner died in an accident in May whilst using the Autopilot feature. The company said the “tragic loss” of Tesla owner Joshua D. Brown was down to “extremely rare circumstances.” Following the incident, Tesla split with self-driving tech partner Mobileye and the new imaging system in HW2 was developed by Tesla itself.
We did see the safety features offered by Autopilot make a positive difference in real-world conditions last year. A video of a Tesla owner in the Netherlands avoiding a seemingly-inevitable pile-up thanks to his Forward Collision Warning system went viral last week, while another recent clip showed a Model S P85D using instant acceleration to escape a likely crash.

648,"No cobalt, no Tesla?",https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/01/no-cobalt-no-tesla/,2017/01/01,"




Sebastien Gandon
Contributor



Sebastien Gandon has close to 15 years experience in the asset management industry and as an investor in energy storage, batteries, biotech/e-health and AI.


The battery industry currently uses 42 percent of global cobalt production, a critical metal for Lithium-ion cells. The remaining 58 percent is used in diverse industrial and military applications (super alloys, catalysts, magnets, pigments…) that rely exclusively on the material.
Approximately 97 percent of the world’s supply of cobalt comes as a by-product of nickel or copper (mostly out of Africa). Freeport-McMoRan Inc. and Lundin agreed to sell to Chinese players their respective stakes in the Tenke Fungurume mine, one of the largest known cobalt sources, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Tesla has stated that the cobalt it needs will be sourced exclusively in North America, but the math doesn’t seem to add up.
Is Tesla doomed? Not necessarily…
The Tenke Fungurume mine is one of the world’s largest known cobalt resources. The concessions are located in the Katanga province in the southeast region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) holds a 56 percent interest, Lundin Mining (OTCPK:LUNMF) holds an indirect 24 percent equity interest and Gécamines, the Congolese state mining company, holds a 20 percent carried interest.
In May, 2016, China Molybdenum acquired Freeport’s 56 percent controlling interest in the mine for US$2.65 billion, the largest investment ever in the country. Lundin Mining was left with three options: allow the China Moly deal to proceed, supplant the offer by exercising a right to first offer or sell its own stake to China Moly (or a third party, for that matter).
In November, and after several extensions, Lundin Mining finally announced it was selling its 24 percent stake to an affiliate of Chinese private-equity firm BHR Partners for US$1.14 billion. Freeport’s sale to China Moly was expected to be completed before year’s end, whilst Lundin plans to close its sale in early 2017.
China Moly also acquired this year from Freeport a 100 percent interest in the Kisanfu exploration project located in the DRC and a 56 percent controlling interest in the Kokkola refinery in Finland (about 10 percent of the world’s refined cobalt last year). Needless to say that all that cobalt from the refinery is expected to be shipped to China, South Korea and Japan from now on.
The implications are clear. China is now leveling its game in upstream cobalt and is already a major owner of downstream assets in the DRC, embodied by Huayou Cobalt (CH:603799) and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt (CH:603799). It will keep on securing cobalt mines and downstream assets for its own needs.
In November, Albert Yuma Mulimbi, head of the state-controlled Gécamines, passed on to the Financial Times his discontent of partnerships with western companies and, in particular, on the Freeport-McMoRan deal. Left with minority investments in most joint ventures (JV), Mr. Yuma believes that existing deals failed to deliver on dividends. The partnership with China Nonferrous Metal Mining. where Gécamines has a 49 percent stake, is the model he wants to generalize. One more headache for western operators.
Supply and demand for cobalt
As I stated in a previous article, we are already witnessing an increased scarcity of cobalt supply. Approximately 97 percent of the world’s supply of cobalt comes as a by-product of nickel or copper. But the price of the two other base metals have been plunging, to say the least, and this year reached six-year lows, making many deposits uneconomic.
Basic economics would tell us that whenever there is a soaring demand and a market supply moving into deficit, shortages and consequently an impact on prices are inevitable. 
New primary cobalt mines may come online should cobalt prices soar; however, exploration, licensing and development take time and require billions of dollars of investments. In addition, 60 percent of the world’s cobalt reserves and resources originate in the DRC, which is riddled with child labor and exploitation.
On the demand front, and according to the Cobalt Development Institute (CDI), 58 percent of global cobalt production is already used in many diverse industrial and military applications (super alloys, catalysts, magnets, pigments…) that rely exclusively on the material. Cobalt represents a negligible part of the costs for these companies and thus they can afford to pay regardless of the price. But that is a dangerous game for battery makers. Material costs account for about 60 percent of LIB total cost and battery makers cannot take away cobalt from companies for whom the metal is an absolute requirement. Think GE and its jet engines.
The Tesla conundrum
So where does that leave us with Tesla? Elon Musk ambitiously aims at producing 500,000 electric vehicles a year by 2018, and Tesla has repeatedly stated that the cobalt will be sourced exclusively in North America. Whether this is a realistic assumption is a different story.
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) states that cobalt production in 2015 was 124,000 metric tons. Canada and the U.S. together produce roughly 4 percent of the world’s supply, nowhere near Tesla’s needs for just one of its models. Indeed, estimations from InvestorIntel show that half a million units of Tesla’s Model 3 would be equivalent to 7,800 tons of new cobalt demand, or roughly 6 percent of the annual cobalt production worldwide. The math does not seem to add up. Tesla reportedly has difficulties securing off-take agreements from traditional cathode material suppliers and is reaching down to junior miners.
Precisely regarding the juniors’ landscape, eCobalt Solutions Inc. (formerly Formation Metals) (TSX:ECS) is a Canadian mineral exploration and mine development company primarily owning the Idaho cobalt project, a high-grade and primary cobalt deposit in the U.S.. The highly anticipated project is by far the most advanced one in the region and should go online in a year’s time. Two more years will be needed to run at full capacity. Production is estimated to reach roughly 1,500 tons annually over the course of a 12.5-year lifetime, i.e. about 1 percent of the global market. Compare this to Tesla’s needs for the Model 3 and the new supply of cobalt in North America looks muted at best.
Basic economics would tell us that whenever there is a soaring demand and a market supply moving into deficit, shortages and consequently an impact on prices are inevitable. Tesla looks doomed… ceteris paribus. So, is it really?
Good news for Tesla bulls: There are several reasons why this may not be the case.
Battery mix. For the Model S, Tesla has been using high energy density nickel-cobalt-aluminium-based (NCA) battery cells sourced from Panasonic. Again, we don’t know the exact composition of the Panasonic/Tesla batteries, but typically cobalt represents about 0.22 kg/kWh in NCA batteries believes John Petersen from InvestorIntel. This compares to 0.36 kg/kWh for nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) batteries, which are adopted by most peers (and in which the three components are usually evenly split). Tesla would withstand more pressure versus its peers in the event of soaring prices.
The Chinese BYD, a major player in the EV space, has adopted lower energy density Lithium-Iron-Phosphate LFP chemistry. Reconfiguring manufacturing capabilities and use instead as LFP or Lithium-manganese-oxide (LMO) that don’t need cobalt is always an option. However, this might severely hamper competitiveness and quality.
Substitution. “Ceteris paribus” is key here. A complete shift away from high-energy batteries looks hypothetical at this stage: NMC, NCA and LCO batteries provide the highest energy density as reported by Battery University, and all require cobalt. However, there has been recently efforts to produce other types of battery chemistries that do not require cobalt as stated by the CRU. Tesla has also been trying to remove cobalt from the equation and add nickel instead, according to its CTO JB Straubel.
We may well see a quick turnaround from cobalt-intensive batteries toward a validated and optimized new high-energy battery technology should it go online. And the high costs triggered by a shift away from traditional batteries might prove beneficial when opposed with the prospects a cobalt cliff. So far attempts for substituting cobalt resulted in a loss in product performance. But nothing is set in stone.

Demand for nickel. Let’s assume for a second that the substitution project remains in draft and that cobalt remains indispensable. Around Ninety-five percent of the world’s supply of cobalt comes as a by-product of nickel or copper. As illustrated by John Petersen, “Every year, the world’s nickel miners sell $14.58 billion of nickel and $1.05 billion of cobalt, which means cobalt revenue represents 6.7% of their total revenue. It’s even worse with copper miners who sell $68.4 billion of copper and $0.92 billion of cobalt, which means cobalt revenue represents 1.3% of their total revenue.” Certainly frightening numbers. Many mines have become a casualty of the low prices and many are being taken offline or “placed on maintenance” for an extended period of time until market prices justify further investments.
However, if it is well-established that the dependence on a primary product is a key supply risk, the opposite is also true. There will be cobalt if there is enough demand for the primary metals. It is unclear what the mix of Panasonic/Tesla’s batteries is, but traditionally an NCA cathode is comprised of roughly 80 percent nickel and 15 percent cobalt. Increased demand for nickel may spur nickel production and, as a consequence, cobalt product. This may overall add some counterweight in the balance.
Identified resources versus reserves. In addition, identified cobalt resources are much larger than existing reserves. According to the CDI, “there seems to be enough known land sources of cobalt to last for at least 100 years and for many, many more years if speculative and hypothetical resources for deep sea, ocean floor resources are taken into account (about 120 million tonnes according to the USGS).”
The CDI thus remains confident that “cobalt is not running out, but its availability will depend upon many factors such as accessibility, price, demand, technological development and global economic growth.” Obviously mining cobalt cheaply in deep water is nothing more than a bad science fiction movie, but should become economically viable (disruptive technologies might start showing their teeth, as we have witnessed in deep water drilling and more recently with fracking).
Recycling. Cobalt (as opposed to oil, for instance) is fully recyclable. Roughly 15 percent of U.S. cobalt consumption is from recycled scrap today. For many applications, the metal is used but not consumed and so can be recycled. Needless to say that recycling can help reduce the need to hunt for new sources of cobalt. In no circumstances is this a magic solution whereby 100 percent can be recycled indefinitely. Existing processes are energy-consuming and can definitely be improved. But that is also an idea to weigh in the balance.
Conclusion
That’s a lot of “ifs,” I grant you that. Tesla is entering an age of supply chain transparency, as Simon Moores from Benchmark Intelligence states, and it wouldn’t hurt to see more communication from Tesla on that front. However, there are many factors that could be part of a complex cobalt equation. I wouldn’t go as far as surrender already and turn into a structural Tesla bear.

649,How fast is fast charging?,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/29/how-fast-is-fast-charging/,2016/12/29,"
EVgo announced this month that it has broken ground on what will be the first public DC fast charging station, capable of up to 350 kw, in California — more powerful even than current charging champs Tesla Superchargers. The EVgo station will be ready to charge up near the World’s Tallest Thermometer (yup) in Baker, California, this summer.
This begs the questions: How fast are other fast chargers? And how fast is fast charging?
The amount of time it takes to charge your EV depends on two things: how much power is being supplied by the charger, and how much power your car’s charging system can handle. An EV has to be compatible with the CHAdeMO standard, the SAE CCS standard or be a Tesla (which comes with plug adapters for the other standards) in order to use Level 3 stations.
At a Level 1 wall outlet, it generally takes overnight — or longer — to charge up a depleted EV battery. At a Level 2 charger, it takes overnight, more or less, to fully charge. At a Level 3 station, a battery can be recharged up to 80 percent usually in under an hour.
Those are the general rules; here are some specifics as reported by the manufacturers:


Tesla Model S: 120 kw Supercharger station, to 80 percent charged in 40 minutes

Jaguar I-PACE concept EV: 50 kw Level 3 station, to 80 percent in 90 minutes

Chevy Bolt: 50 kw Level 3 station, 90 miles in 30 minutes

Nissan Leaf: 50 kw Level 3 station, 80 percent in 30 minutes

EVgo has a network of more than 800 fast chargers in addition to the new high-power station, which will have four chargers at first with the capability to expand to eight. It will also have a solar-panel canopy to power the chargers and shade the people and cars using the stations, plus back-up batteries for the system in case you stop to charge at night. The station won’t have the Wi-Fi hotspot that you’ll find at a Tesla Supercharger, but don’t forget — it does have the World’s Tallest Thermometer.

More companies working on autonomous driving have decided to work together to pursue their goals; Nokia mapping spin-out Here is working with Mobileye, the company that creates computer vision chips, cameras and other tech to support self-driving development on mapping service collaboration.
The companies announced the partnership on Thursday, noting that they’re going to be pairing Mobileye’s Roadbook, which identifies and maps drivable routes in real-time using crowdsourced data, with Here’s HD Live Map, as a layer that can add to its existing data. Autonomous tech uses high-definition mapping to supplement info from onboard sensors, providing a continually updated look at what the car should expect to see on the road in addition to what it’s able to observe in its immediate surroundings.
Mobileye’s also going to be using Here’s Open Location Platform as part of the deal, and Here will gain access to raw sensor data from vehicles equipped with Mobileye’s REM tech for real-time monitoring of road conditions. This should help Here’s HD Live Map get updates even faster, leading to them better reflection actual real-time driving settings for autonomous cars.
Maps are a key ingredient in self-driving, and this should help both companies become more attractive supply partners to automakers as they seek to deploy self-driving vehicles and fleet services.

What do you do when your love of driving conflicts with your deep and abiding love of conference calls? That’s a question Volvo hopes it can finally answer, with the integration of Skype for Business directly into its 90 series cars, letting drivers see their future meetings, and join via a single button press on the in-car center console infotainment touchscreen.
The Skype integration is a way of getting around the messier parts of joining conference calls, including entering long participant pin codes, and sometimes sequential button requirements that feed you through a chain of options before you ever even get to the meeting itself. Volvo and Microsoft are clearly doing everything they can to position this as a distraction reducer, rather than the other way around.
Skype in the car initially sounds like a terrible idea, since it’s natural to assume that you’re going to be video chatting if you’re more familiar with Skype’s early role as a video communication pioneer. But it’s true that people who’re motivated to do business calls on the road aren’t going to change their habits just because it isn’t easy to get on a call. Minimizing the steps required in joining the conference truly should help in terms of keeping driver focus as much as possible on the road itself.
This is also just a start for the Microsoft/Volvo alliance, which also involves figuring out how virtual assistant Cortana might benefit busy drivers through voice recognition and intelligent recognition of context, along with insights derived from calendars and other sources. Even further down the road, Volvo is predicting an autonomous vehicle future where having productivity software available in the car makes even more sense.
As a first step, this might not seem like much, but it’s a way for Volvo and Microsoft to begin thinking about that future, and what it might look like when a commute is more than just time to focus on getting from point A to point B safely.

652,Ford’s newest self-driving test cars have more compute power and better vision,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/28/fords-newest-self-driving-test-cars-have-more-compute-power-and-better-vision/,2016/12/28,"
Ford has developed a new generation of autonomous development vehicle, a hybrid Fusion that uses the same essential platform as its current vehicles, but with a big upgrade to processing power through new on-board computing hardware, as well as improved LiDAR sensors, which deliver a better field of view and improved overall vision to the sensor suite despite dropping two LiDAR units from the design.
The new Fusion also contains software improvements, making for a better virtual driver. This new generation of car will replace the existing one, which first made its debut on streets in testing three years ago. Ford has been testing its cars in Michigan, California and Arizona in real-world settings, and plans to do more of that with a fleet expansion that should triple the size of the current testing pool to about 90 active vehicles sometime in 2017.

Ford’s autonomous vehicle Chief Program Engineer Chris Brewer explained its progress in a Medium post, noting that despite the move from four to two LiDAR sensors, they can gather just as much data as the combined total used in the previous development vehicle. The two sensors combined provide 360-degree coverage and can see about “the length of two football field in every direction,” Brewer notes.
Three optical cameras on the Fusion’s Roof racks, a front-facing camera behind the windshield, short-and long-range radar complete the picture the car sees, which is used together using the onboard computing power. This built-in supercomputer can generate a full terabyte of data per hour, Brewer says. All that virtual processing capability requires a second power converter, and also explains the use of hybrids – Ford notes that a standard gas-powered car just doesn’t have the energy to achieve autonomy right now.

All of Ford’s work is preface to its plan to launch autonomous vehicles in a commercial setting in 2021, beginning with an self-driving ride-hailing fleet.

Tesla is fond of talking about the safety potential of its Autopilot and upcoming autonomous driving technologies, but it’s rare that we get the chance to see them in action potentially saving lives. That’s the case with this video of Tesla’s Autopilot 8.0 software in action, which employs radar tech to be able to see around objects that would block a human driver’s field of vision.
In this case, the Tesla Forward Collision Warning system (which sends an audible alert when a driver might be in danger of crashing into something ahead of the vehicle) sounds before you can even see the car immediately in front of the driver’s Tesla Model X braking. Why? It seems to have sensed the SUV in front of that vehicle coming to a sudden stop, which the smaller vehicle which ends up rear-ended it did not notice in time.
This looks like it could’ve been a prime candidate for a pileup, including the Model X that captured the video, but instead as the dashcam footage shows, the vehicle not only alerted the driver about the potential collision but even started applying its emergency braking system before he himself could react and do so. The result is that the Model X stops well back of the collision (in which all parties luckily turned out to be okay, beyond the vehicle damage).
Previous footage captured by Tesla drivers have shown other safety features, including how its instant acceleration can help avoid the kind of rear-ending that happens to the other vehicle ahead of the Tesla in this video. Tesla CEO Elo Musk also aims to field full autonomy in test capacity by the end of 2017, which the company believes will help boost its safety potential even further.

654,Volkswagen purchases PayByPhone for parking,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/28/volkswagen-purchases-paybyphone-for-parking/,2016/12/28,"
PayByPhone, the app that lets you pay for parking (and parking tickets) with a smartphone, has been acquired by Volkswagen Financial Services. PayByPhone is based in Vancouver, British Columbia, and operates in Canada, the US, France, Great Britain, Switzerland, and Australia. In 2016, company processed $250 million in parking payments from 12.5 million users.
Volkswagen Financial Services had already bought Sunhill Technologies, the largest cashless payment solution in Germany, last year, so PayByPhone expands the company’s parking payment possibilities.
“It is important to make the distinction that it is Volkswagen Financial Services (VWFS) who acquired us, and they have a charter to focus on general mobility services,” said PayByPhone CEO Kush Parikh in an email interview. “Outside of being the largest parking payment provider, the key asset we bring to the table is the relationship we have via our flagship mobile applications with our users. The mobile relationship is a one to one relationship that can extend into a myriad of additional services.”
PayByPhone is focusing on parking payments first before branching into other mobility technology spaces, like car sharing or ride hailing applications for this service. “Our plans are focused on making the parking payment experience as seamless and easy as possible for users,” Kush wrote. The company already has a program in London where license plates are coordinated with a user account when the car arrives in a lot, and then the user is charged for her parking time when she leaves. “[This] can quite easily be extended into the autonomous vehicle movement,” Kush said.
PayByPhone’s expansion hasn’t been hindered so much by its ability to scale as by an entrenched parking industry “that continues to hold on to archaic cash and credit card based systems, which are very capital intensive,” as Kush put it. PayByPhone does expect that VWFS’s investment will help the company expand into new countries.
Kush noted that while the company will be focused on making parking payments as seamless as possible, they do have an eye on the future. “Parking is a great way to attract users where their identities can be used for a myriad of additional services, including movement around cities (aka smart cities) and distributing our service into any application, such as mapping and travel applications.”

Tesla has a habit of including Easter Eggs (aka hidden software features) in its software updates, and the latest update includes two doozies. The first is a holiday light show for Model X owners that takes full advantage of the electric SUV’s folding gullwing doors, along with its turn indicators, fog lights, headlights and more. Plus a rousing soundtrack to get you in the holiday spirit.
That’s not all, though – for people looking for an even more escapist experience from their car, both Model S and Model X owners with the update can ‘transform’ their vehicles into a Mars-bound spacecraft; the one his other company, SpaceX, is building to send colonists to the red planet.
This bonus feature, triggered by entering ‘Mars’ as the access code for your vehicle’s software system, will turn your in-car map to a map of the surface of Mars, and as you drive around the position of your virtual red planet rover will cross new Mars planetary terrain, too. Both Easter Eggs, and the way to enable them, can be seen in the DragTimes YouTube clips above and below.

The unintended ways self-driving cars will change our lives
No UI Is The New UI




When I was young, I remember tuning in with my brother for the Sunday morning cartoons and watching reruns of the Jetson family going about in their flying car. That was the golden era for science fiction. Hollywood was filled with movies like Blade Runner, Back to the Future, Star Wars and The Fifth Element. These movies promised us futuristic worlds full of wonderful tech.
It seems like we’ve achieved that future in many ways. Everybody now has a super transmitter in their pocket, allowing them to communicate instantly with anyone else on the planet. We’ve mapped the human genome, made most of the human knowledge freely accessible at one’s fingertips and hell, we’re even making plans to colonize Mars. But despite all of this, one part is missing. There are still no flying cars in sight. They can’t be so hard to make, right?
The forgotten history of flying cars
Source: Popular Mechanics
Believe it or not, flying cars have been around for more than 70 years. Ever since Jules Verne introduced the idea in his 1904 Master of the World novel, generations of engineers have tried to make flying cars happen. In 1940, Henry Ford predicted that a combination of airplane and motorcar was coming. At the time, both the car and the plane were becoming cheaper, better and saw massive adoption. A combination of the two was thought to be inevitable. It turns out Ford was right. Just a few years after his announcement, aeronautical engineer Ted Hall came out with the first fully functioning flying car.

What you just watched is a 70-year-old video of a fully working flying car. The vehicle was a combination of a road car and attachable wings. It was backed by Convair, a major airplane manufacturer at the time, and had a total of 66 successful test flights. With just a few minor adjustments, it promised to become a huge commercial success. But in 1947, a crash landing during a test flight led Convair to back out. The project, judged to be too dangerous, was eventually shut down, along with Hall’s dream of a flying car in every garage.

Since then, there have been countless attempts at building flying cars. None of them made it beyond the prototype phase. However, what’s most remarkable about the idea of the flying car is how enduring it is. Despite a history of failures and setbacks, every generation of engineers have been, and still are, captivated by the idea.
Ultimately, the reason we don’t have flying cars isn’t technological or cost limitations. 
Today, companies like Terrafugia, AeroMobil and Moller International are actively pushing the dream forward. You probably have never heard of them, but all of these companies have actual, workingflying car prototypes.
AeroMobil’s latest prototype, aptly named, the AeroMobil 3.0
Dude, where’s my flying car?
As we’ve seen, the technology for flying cars has been around for decades, and even today, companies are working on them. So why are there still no flying cars in sight?
In a word: humans.

As I covered before, humans are horrible drivers. In the U.S., cars cause about 30,000 deaths per year, costing $871 billion dollars in the process. Think of the worst driver you know. Now imagine that person flying a two-ton death machine. How would that make you feel?

Public adoption of flying cars would be a death warrant for every single building in the world. Modern buildings have been designed to sustain normal car crashes (which happen all the time), but not flying ones. In the air, a mere collision with another car could send both vehicles crashing to the ground. Who would want to live in a world where flying metal can fall on your head at any time?
Ultimately, the reason we don’t have flying cars isn’t technological or cost limitations. It’s because most human beings are way too unreliable to fly anything.
Enters driverless tech
This is where it gets interesting: We’ve already solved the problem of unreliable human beings with self-driving cars.
Self-driving cars are real. All of the biggest tech companies are working on them, and it is only a matter of time until we see Google-like cars everywhere. While self-driving cars are neat, they are not nearly as fascinating as their potential successor: self-flying cars.
“How can a computer be smart enough to fly a vehicle?” you might ask.
It turns out, it is much easier to build driverless tech for flying vehicles than regular cars. In the air, there are no pedestrians, potholes, construction sites or any other obstacles that give computers a headache. This is why driverless tech has been first developed for airplanes and has now been used in airfare for decades. Recent advances in sensors, computing and AI are making human pilots almost unnecessary. Today, pilots fly, on average, between 3.5 and 7 minutes per flight. While pilots’ income used to compare to lawyers and doctors, the entry salary for new pilots in the U.S. can now go as low as $10.75 per hour. There has been a lot of talk about how automation is taking out taxi and truck driving jobs. Pilots are no exception.
To sum things up, safety is the main issue with flying cars, and driverless tech is the key to solving that problem. So, who is working on that?
The usual suspects

In the last years, three major players in the Valley have raised strong interest in flying vehicles. All of them are currently working on driverless technology. Oh, and they also have very deep pockets, access to the best engineers in the world and a history of making seemingly impossible ideas happen. They are Travis Kalanick, Larry Page and Elon Musk.
Last month, Uber published a 98-page white paper explaining their vision for our flying-car future. The paper, summarized here, describes a concrete plan to expand their business toward a global, shared, on-demand aviation service within the next 10 years. In short: Picture the Uber app, but for driverless, flying vehicles.
Beyond Uber, Larry Page also has a big interest in flying cars. In the past years, he has secretly invested more than a $100 million in two flying car startups, Zee.Aero and Kitty Hawk. Zee.Aero is currently testing its prototype at the Hollister Municipal Airport, where people have reported seeing weird vehicles taking off and landing. Kitty Hawk is a bit more secretive, but interestingly enough, it is run by Sebastian Thrun, the former head of Google’s self-driving car program.
Picture the Uber app, but for driverless, flying vehicles.
As for Musk, well, he doesn’t quite believe in the idea of a flying car. Not because they would be too hard to make, mind you, but because he thinks there are more efficient ways of traveling between cities, such as the Hyperloop. However, for long distance travel, he thinks that electric aircraft are the way to go. In several interviews, he mentioned that his next big idea is a supersonic electric jet. In fact, he already has a design, and if no one else does it, he might start yet another company to make it happen.
What’s interesting about these projects is that they have one point in common: their design. Indeed, Uber, Page and Musk’s projects are about electric, human-carrying vehicles that can take off and land vertically. That last part is important.
VTOLs, aka drones for humans
You could argue that the flying cars shown so far are, at best, an awkward and overly expensive combination of a plane and a car —  the resulting vehicle being much worse than the sum of its parts. This is because planes and cars are meant for very different purposes, and merging the two means making terrible compromises. Ultimately, you would be better off buying a plane and a car separately.
To solve this design problem, we first need to let go of the idea that a flying car should look like a plane or a car. I’ve covered how we have the bad tendency to apply old solutions to new technology, and why ground-breaking products usually require a new design approach. This is exactly what we’re getting with VTOLs.
VTOLs stands for Vertical Take Off and Landing vehicles. In short, the same technology that made possible today’s drone revolution will enable our future, human-carrying flying cars. Forget wings and wheels; we’re talking about the Jetson type of flying car. Picture DJI’s drones, but for people.
The EHang 184, unveiled at CES 2016, is among the most exciting prototypes.
If driverless tech was the key to making flying cars safe, drone tech is the key to making them simple and ready for mass production.Beyond looking silly, strapping plane wings to a car is a flawed idea in many ways. Wings mean the vehicle has to take off horizontally, which is dangerous, cumbersome and requires a lot of space. By switching to vertical thrusters, the vehicle can achieve a high altitude much faster, which saves a lot of energy. With such a design, you can strip the vehicle of its most dangerous, movables parts, such as the wings, the tail and elevators. The resulting design is simpler, safer and easier to mass produce.
We need to let go of the idea that a flying car should look like a plane or a car.
Another key part of the design is the electric motor. Beyond this being great for the environment, electricity is the most logical option for VTOLs. Because they don’t require as many moving parts, electric motors are much easier to produce than combustion engines. They are also way more energy-efficient, easier to maintain, less likely to break down mid-flight and can’t explode in case of impact. Electric motors also enable having multiple asynchronized thrusters. If one thruster fails, the others can instantly adjust to compensate and land safely. Finally, electricity has the huge benefit of being silent. This is a big distinguishing factor between VTOLs and helicopters. In their paper, Uber estimates that, during take-off, the VTOL’s noise will be comparable to the city’s background noise. During flight, it should be barely audible.
Your daily, flying commute

Who has ever dreamed about, while being stuck in traffic, pressing a big red button, soaring up in the air and flying over all the other suckers? Eliminating traffic is the dream and the promise of flying cars.
Just like skyscrapers allowed cities to use limited land more efficiently, urban air transportation will use three-dimensional airspace to alleviate transportation congestion on the ground  —  Jeff Holden, Uber’s CPO
As I mentioned before, traffic his a huge burden for our society. In the U.S. alone, traffic wastes about $124 billion annually. One of the biggest causes of traffic is the lack of infrastructure. Our highways were never designed to sustain today’s amount of commuters. With VTOLs, that won’t be a problem anymore. Their mainstream adoption would massively reduce the need for roads, rails, bridges and tunnels. In addition to being great news for the environment, this would mean hundreds of billions of dollars in potential infrastructure savings.
Furthermore, not being bound to infrastructure also means saving a lot of time. Trains, buses and cars can only go from A to B in limited and sometimes inefficient ways. Roads are constantly exposed to interruptions, such as car crashes or construction work. Flying, on the other hand, means being able to travel in a straight line, which is the shortest distance between you and your destination. In addition, being able to take off and land vertically is a huge advantage over current aircraft because you aren’t dependent on airports and runways anymore. Just take off near home, and land next to your destination. Again, less infrastructure required, more time saved.

In its paper, Uber estimates long-distance commute as the best initial use-case for VTOLS. Ultimately, with mass production, they believe VTOLs could be cheaper than owning a car. For example, a 2-hour 12-minute drive from San Francisco to San Jose could eventually be a 15-minute, $20 ride in a VTOL. Pretty good.

One step closer to our robot overlords: the VTOL UAV


Flying cars still have a long way to go. In its white paper, Uber underlines the major challenges needed to make them a reality. For starters, even if they don’t require any pilots, new flying vehicles need to comply with FAA regulations, which will likely take a long time. Furthermore, there are still concerns about costs and safety, and the battery technology isn’t quite there yet. In its white paper, Uber presents how it plans to address those concerns and achieve public adoption of VTOLs within the next 10 years.
In From Zero to One, Peter Thiel presents the controversial idea that we don’t live in an innovative world anymore. He argues that, while the industrial revolution saw massive innovations such as electricity, home appliances, skyscrapers, cars, airplanes, etc., today’s innovation is mostly confined to IT and communication. As Thiel puts it, our smartphones distract us from the fact that our lifestyle has remained strangely unchanged since the 1950s.
I would propose that is not the case anymore. At least, not in transportation. Recent projects such as the self-driving car, the Hyperloop and reusable rockets prove that innovation is alive and well. And now, on-demand shared flying cars promise to democratize air travel the same way the car once democratized ground transportation. Ultimately, this means better, faster, cheaper, safer and environmentally friendlier mobility for all.
Flying cars might still have a long road ahead of them, but it doesn’t matter. Because Marty, where we’re going, we don’t need roads.

657,Most Autopilot features could come to Teslas with updated hardware next week,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/23/most-autopilot-features-could-come-to-teslas-with-updated-hardware-next-week/,2016/12/23,"
Newer Tesla Model S and Model X owners get a big benefit vs. their predecessors – all the sensors and computing power onboard needed to achieve full self-driving when the software’s ready. But they also had to deal with a temporary inconvenience, since they shipped without the majority of Tesla’s current Autopilot features, which provides advanced semi-autonomous driving for use on highways, including automated steering for lane-keeping, and adaptive speed for maintaining distance with other cars. Tesla CEO Elon Musk says that owners of so-called “Hardware 2” Tesla vehicles won’t have to wait long to get their functioning Autopilot update, however.


Looks like we might be ready to rollout most of Autopilot functionality for HW2 towards the end of next week
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 23, 2016



The update has required additional time because it’s actually different from the original Autopilot system, and takes advantage of new on-board computer vision capabilities made possible by the changes to the sensor and computer hardware.
Musk notes that “most of” the original Autopilot functionality will be pushed via this update, but he doesn’t specify exactly what. The major features still not present in HW2 vehicles include emergency braking, blind spot detection, smart cruise control, auto steer and auto lane change, but other features also still need to be added to reach parity.
Again, owners of the newer Tesla hardware stand to benefit in the long run – only their cars will eventually be able to drive fully autonomously, after all, and in the meantime Autopilot improvements that aren’t possible using the old sensor loadout and computing stack will probably make it to their vehicles, too. But those in possession of the new cars are probably happy that Tesla appears to be on track to deliver an end-of-2016 treat with the addition of some of these highlight features.

658,Autonomous cars seen as smarter than human drivers,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/22/autonomous-cars-seen-as-smarter-than-human-drivers/,2016/12/22,"
PwC released the results of its latest survey on the future of automotive technology, and it seems Americans are coming around to the idea of autonomous cars, ride hailing and car sharing. So much so that 66 percent of respondents said they think autonomous cars are probably smarter than the average human driver.
PwC, a global provider of professional services, directly surveyed 1,584 people aged 16 and older in the U.S. to ask them about the future of transportation. They found that people’s acceptance of the new technology depended more on their attitudes toward technology than their age and that people wanted practical tech as opposed to shiny doodads.
Gen X and Gen Y, which covered ages 21 through 49 in this study, were the most likely to be enthusiasts who were interested in all the new automotive technology. People older than 50 and younger than 20 were less interested in any automotive tech at all.
It’s interesting to note that the top three technologies that people would consider paying more for were emergency-related. Comprehensive vehicle tracking, remote vehicle shutdown and a driver override system were on the wish lists of more than two-thirds of respondents. Those technologies even outranked gesture controls and perfect integration with smartphones.
Ride-sharing usage via services like Uber are slowly creeping upward, with 37 percent of respondents saying they’d used ride sharing at some point. Of the remainder who hadn’t used ride sharing, 55 percent said they were interested in trying it. But you’ve been warned, Uber: while 74 percent of respondents believed that “ride sharing does not hurt the economy,” 72 percent did believe the industry should be regulated. That interest did not extend to car sharing. Only 23 percent had used a service like Zipcar or car2go, and only 37 percent were interested in even trying it out.
As for autonomous cars, people were mostly worried about safety, including the possibility of their car being hacked. But people also gave lots of positive responses for using self-driving cars, like being better transportation for the elderly and having fewer accidents. So people are concerned about self-driving cars being safe, but they’re also willing to concede that they’ll probably follow the rules of the road better and crash less.
The study found that 13 percent of consumers saw no advantages to autonomous vehicles. When asked if they’d be willing to give up some privacy for access to high-tech features like augmented reality displays in autonomous vehicles, 60 percent said no. And 53 percent (part of those who were concerned about safety) said they were “scared of self-driving cars,” so there are still barriers to overcome for our robot overlords.

659,Uber lawsuit alleges employees were misled on equity compensation,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/22/uber-lawsuit-alleges-employees-were-misled-on-equity-compensation/,2016/12/22,"
An Uber employee has filed a lawsuit accusing the company of misleading employees about their equity compensation. Uber “devised a fraudulent scheme to recruit highly sought software engineers,” according to the case.  
The lawsuit claims that Uber promised a more tax favorable type of options at the time employees were hired and then later changed the plan. The case alleges that at least 100 others on the Uber staff may have been impacted and that these stock options can potentially be worth “hundreds of millions of dollars” to employees and also save Uber “millions of dollars of tax deductions.”
The plaintiff, Lenza McElrath, who was previously a lawyer and is now an engineer at Uber, says that he was under the impression that all his shares could be treated as ISOs, which do not require an upfront tax bill. He said he was later given a notice about a change to the exercisability schedule, that effectively turned most of his shares into NSOs, which are taxed at the time they are exercised.
While many startups allow their shares to become exercisable over the course of a four-year vesting agreement, Uber has share agreements that become exercisable after just six months. In other words, Uber employees can buy the stock they are entitled to shortly after they gain employment.
Exercising options sooner can potentially result in long-term tax savings, so Uber can make the case that they did this to benefit employees.  But by designating them as “exercisable” at this point in time, regardless of whether they are actually exercised, it triggers the law that no employee is entitled to more than $100,000 of exercisable ISOs in a given year. The rest are automatically treated as NSOs.
According to the legal claim, “this tax is many times the strike price and can total hundreds of thousands of dollars, meaning that NSOs – unlike ISOs — can impede an employee’s ability to exercise the option depending on whether he or she has the financial resources to pay the tax.”
Uber has given us the following statement.  “We want our employees to have a real stake in Uber’s success, and we’re proud to offer equity compensation in service of that goal. Whereas our stock incentive plans are designed to work for all employees, we believe Mr. McElrath has misinterpreted his stock option agreement to benefit himself and his particular tax situation.”
The Uber team will likely point to McElrath’s legal background and claim that he is a litigious individual. After attending Stanford Law School, he worked at O’Melveny & Myers and later worked with the legal team at Yelp, while he was also an engineer there. He previously sued AT&T for poor service, which was sent into arbitration.
They may also argue that the employment agreement states that the ISOs could be subject to tax restrictions. “The Option will be incentive stock option to the maximum extent allowed by the tax code.”
The stock option agreement, which was presented after the employee joined the company, specifically warns that the options could be treated as NSOs. They explicitly lay out the scenario where anything in excess of $100,000 triggers the NSOs.
Others are even arguing that the whole notion behind the case is faulty because it assumes that ISOs are better than NSOs. It’s “all premised on this notion that an ISO is clearly superior from a tax perspective, which is not necessarily a true statement,” said Christine McCarthy, a partner in the technology companies group at Orrick. Because an ISO could potentially trigger other taxes, known as AMT, “whether or not there is significant harm is a substantial question,” she said.
But even if McElrath’s financial burden is exaggerated, the court may still want to evaluate what was verbally promised to him in the course of job interviews or other communication with the company. It has yet to be determined if they’ve fallen short on commitments to him or other employees.
If the court ultimately concludes that McElrath was misled, then this suit may have precedent. This case could not only pose significance for the other similarly situated Uber employees, but also the staff at other startups.

One of the most compelling reasons to join a company like Uber is the equity compensation package. At the time McElrath joined the company in 2014, Uber was said to be valued at just $18 billion. Today, it is estimated to be worth $68 billion.
Early employees at places like Google and Facebook were handsomely rewarded after the companies went public and their share values went up. Uber is rumored to go public within the next two years.
A similar lawsuit was previously filed in a California state court, where the judge dismissed most of the allegations against Uber, but allowed the misrepresentation claims to move forward. The suit was refiled in the U.S. District Court on Monday and he is represented by Phillips, Erlewine, Given & Carlin, a firm which has been involved in a class-action suit against the Honest Company.
We’ve included both the lawsuit and the employment agreement documents provided by Uber.

Tesla has claimed the top spot in Consumer Reports’ annual owner satisfaction survey, which polls subscribers about their cars and their feelings toward the brands that make them. Ninety-one percent of Tesla owners polled would buy another Tesla vehicle in the future, the survey found.
Consumer Reports’ survey pool covered more than 300,000 different vehicles, and Tesla regained the crown that it held in the previous year, besting Porsche and Audi in the No. 2 and No. 3 spots, respectively. It topped Porsche by 7 percentage points, and the rankings represent the number of respondents who said they’d “definitely” purchase another car by the same automaker in the future.
Tesla’s Model S earned a buy recommendation from Consumer Reports earlier this year, after its reliability rating improved. The publication also chided the automaker for Model X reliability, however, leading to an overall low ranking in its annual reliability survey when it comes to the Tesla brand as whole.

661,Uber deploying self-driving cars from San Francisco pilot in Arizona instead,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/22/uber-deploying-self-driving-cars-from-san-francisco-pilot-in-arizona-instead/,2016/12/22,"
Uber will be rolling out its third-generation self-driving test vehicles, which are sensor-lated Volvo XC90 SUVs, in Arizona following their loss of registration in California. An Uber spokesperson tells TechCrunch that the cars actually left for Arizona by truck on Tuesday morning, and that they will be deployed there “in the next few weeks” with the full support of state Governor Doug Ducey.
Earlier on Thursday, Governor Ducey tweeted his clear support for Uber’s self-driving test, basically articulating an unqualified desire to have Uber redirect its efforts to Arizona. GM is also testing self-driving vehicles in Arizona, with a Scottsdale pilot launched earlier this year, and the state has also been working with Google’s self-driving car project, now its own company under Alphabet known as Waymo.
Uber met with the California Department of Motor Vehicles and the California state Attorney General’s office on Wednesday, after refusing to pursue a permit for testing autonomous driving in the state and continuing its San Francisco city pilot anyway. The result of the meeting was that the DMV revoked registration for 16 of Uber’s vehicles, the test fleet it had deployed with autonomous hardware and software in SF.
California’s DMV said it had also invited Uber once again to complete its permitting process, a required step for any company looking to test autonomous tech on public roads in the state. Uber said it would instead look to deploy its vehicles elsewhere, and it clearly wasted no time in doing so.

Uber maintains that it did not require the permit because its vehicles still required a driver present at all times, and were not truly classified as autonomous cars under the California DMV’s definition. The ride-hailing company provided TechCrunch the images above of its XC90 fleet being loaded on Otto semi-trucks for transport to Arizona.

662,Tesla update caps Autopilot at posted speed limit on undivided roads,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/22/tesla-update-caps-autopilot-at-posted-speed-limit-on-undivided-roads/,2016/12/22,"
Tesla is pushing out an update that will cap the max speed of Autopilot at the posted speed limit while using Autosteer, which controls the wheel while maintaining the car’s lane when engaged, TechCrunch has confirmed. The cap applies on undivided roads, and replaces previous functionality that allowed them to exceed the posted limit by up to 5 mph on these kinds of roadways.
Autopilot still doesn’t have this kind of speed limit restriction on divided highways, where the 90 mph global cap still applies, as Electrek first reported.
Restrictions like this are likely a wise safety measure, since the posted limits are there for a reason, even if in practice human drivers rarely actually match it exactly. Tesla has also previously added more features to alert drivers of when they need to resume manual control of the vehicle and put their hands on the steering wheel.
Tesla is also working on an updated Autopilot system called Enhanced Autopilot that will take advantage of the autonomous driving sensors and onboard computing power that all new Tesla vehicles have been shipping with since October, though it’ll also be limited to vehicles shipped since then, too. Tesla CEO Elon Musk noted this week that progress on that system was coming along nicely, though it doesn’t appear as though it’ll be made available before the end of this year.

Volkswagen is extending the I.D. concept family it debuted at the Paris Motor Show earlier this year with a new concept car in the same line to be fully revealed at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit in January. The carmaker teased the concept today, revealing a few details about the car, including that it’s designed to be fully self-driving in the future.
The new addition to the I.D. family will also be a fully electric vehicles, based on Volkswagen’s new Modular Electric Drive (MEB) base, which is the new platform Volvo is using as the anchor for its plan to diversify and expand its EV line to over 30 models introduces over the coming decade.
This new concept looks like it’ll be much more future-focused than the I.D. unveiled at the Paris Motor Show, which Volkswagen said will eventually become the first production vehicle based on its MEB. It’s truly designed for autonomy – there’s a steering wheel on board, but it vanishes when the user pushes the VW logo buttoning its center, retracting into the dash to provide more room for the driver to stretch out.

It sounds like a design that’s truly looking to articulate a real vision of how we might use our vehicles in a post-driving world. No doubt it’ll also be a long time before we see anything like this on the road, but watching how VW’s thinking about incorporating autonomous tech into consumer vehicles is still interesting.

664,Elon Musk says Tesla’s vision neural net for Autopilot is “now working well”,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/22/elon-musk-says-teslas-vision-neural-net-for-autopilot-is-now-working-well/,2016/12/22,"
Tesla is making progress towards its goal of making its latest cars fully self-driving, according to Elon Musk sharing some updates about the project, and about Enhanced Autopilot, the improved semi-autonomous driver assist system Tesla is planning to release in the near-term, before full autonomy is available. Musk addressed follower questions about Enhanced Autopilot’s progress on Twitter, including work on its new vision system, which is at the core of the Autopilot improvements.


@adrianvolts @TeslaMotors @TeslaMotorsClub @Teslarati Tesla software team is working seven days a week to complete testing and validation. Getting close.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 18, 2016



Impatience from users is understandable – Tesla owners who’ve taken delivery of vehicles since the company announced that all cars made going forward would have everything they need hardware-wise to achieve full autonomy, but the catch was that new cars wouldn’t have Tesla’s existing Autopilot system, and would instead have to wait for Enhanced Autopilot to arrive.
As its name implies, however, enhanced autopilot should indeed be better than its predecessor when it does arrive. Tesla says it will include speed matching with surrounding traffic, lane keeping, automatic lane switching, freeway merging and exit, along with self-parking and summoning on startup.
Tesla Vision is a key part of making all of that possible, and that tech relies on image processing via an onboard neural net for object identification and avoidance. Musk noted in another tweet that progress on that part of the tech is “working well,” and that all the company now has to do is validate its effectiveness across a “wide range of environments” – and that means a lot of time spent driving with the system engaged in test vehicles.


Tesla Autopilot vision neural net now working well. Just need to get a lot of road time to validate in a wide range of environments.

It doesn’t sound like Enhanced Autopilot will be ready in time for the end of 2016, but it’s likely on track for early next year. And that’s good news for Tesla’s further self-driving plans, too, since Musk has targeted the end of 2017 for a cross-country test of fully automated Tesla driverless driving.

Uber has confirmed that it will stop its self-driving pilot in San Francisco, following a meeting today with the California DMV and Attorney General’s office. The DMV revoked the registration on 16 self-driving test vehicles Uber was using in its pilot.
The DMV tells TechCrunch that it invited Uber to complete its permitting process at the same time it revoked it the vehicle registrations. Uber told TechCrunch that it will instead be looking to deploy the vehicles elsewhere for the time being. Here’s Uber’s statement on the matter in full:

We have stopped our self-driving pilot in California as the DMV has revoked the registrations for our self-driving cars. We’re now looking at where we can redeploy these cars but remain 100 percent committed to California and will be redoubling our efforts to develop workable statewide rules.

Uber had begun updating self-driving Volvo X90 SUVs in San Francisco on December 14, providing service to randomly selected uberX customers in the area. It chose not to pursue the permit the state issues to companies for testing autonomous vehicles on public roads, arguing that its cars didn’t require such permits as they could not operate completely autonomously at this stage.
While initially Uber continued its pilot even in the face of regulatory objections, both the DMV and California’s Attorney General’s office said that Uber would face legal repercussions, including injunctive action, if they maintained the active service.
Uber currently operates another trial of its self-driving technology, in Pittsburgh, where its Advanced Technology Group is based. Those trials, which began earlier this year, use Ford Focus vehicles retrofitted with autonomous sensors and onboard computing, and will continue.

666,Waymo enters formal talks with Honda to collaborate on self-driving,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/21/waymo-enters-formal-talks-with-honda-to-collaborate-on-self-driving/,2016/12/21,"
Former Google self-driving car project Waymo is wasting no time demonstrating its readiness to enter into commercial agreements — the Alphabet-owned autonomous driving technology company is in formal discussions with Honda on partnering up to use Waymo self-driving software and sensors on Honda vehicles.
Honda announced the discussions, which preface a potential collaboration between the two companies, via press release on Wednesday. The automaker would provide engineers that would work hand-in-hand with Waymo engineers to develop vehicles intended to join with Waymo’s current fleet of test cars.
Honda positions this as a parallel effort to its own “on-going” attempts to bring automated driving to highways for its customers sometime around 2020. It says the Waymo tie-up would “allow Honda R&D to explore a different technological approach to bring fully self-driving technology to market,” alongside what it’s already working on via its Silicon Valley Lab and through engineering efforts based out of Tochigi, Japan.
Waymo also just took possession of 100 test Chrysler Pacifica minivans from Honda competitor FCA, and will deploy those in its fleet, as well. This new potential partnership with Honda, if it progresses beyond this formal discussion stage, shows how potentially well-positioned it could be as a key supplier of autonomous tech to automakers down the road.
At Waymo’s official unveiling earlier this month, the company went to considerable lengths to outline its position as a potential partner and supplier of self-driving tech to OEMs. It’ll have competition from others, including BlackBerry, Delphi and Mobileye, and potentially even Nvidia at some point down the road, but the project kicked off in 2009 at Google X and it’s clearly seeing the benefits of its early focus on true Level 4 and Level 5 autonomy (which is to say self-driving that requires no human intervention, or even pedals or a steering wheel) pay off in terms of its appeal as a technology partner.

667,Uber losses expected to hit $3 billion in 2016 despite revenue growth,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/21/uber-losses-expected-to-hit-3-billion-in-2016-despite-revenue-growth/,2016/12/21,"
Uber’s losses are growing from $2.2 billion last year to an expected $3 billion this year, according to multiple reports this week from The Information and others.
It’s hard to fathom Uber operating so far from profitability at a time when it feels like an established mainstream brand on the global stage.
Hip hop stars like Drake or Wiz Khalifa commonly name check Uber now in their lyrics, and multiple Hollywood studios have signed big names, including Will Ferrell,  to produce and star in comedies about Uber drivers.
The ride hailing pioneer is expected to surpass $5.5 billion in net revenue in 2016, according to a Bloomberg report, up from an estimated $2 billion in revenue last year.
While that kind of sales growth is normally impressive, considering the $3 billion in anticipated losses, Uber is apparently spending $1.55 for every dollar it makes.
An Uber spokesperson said the company does not comment on its financials.
Here’s where we know Uber has spent some of that scratch: developing self-driving vehicles, growing its food delivery business, paying drivers and employees, and a lot of affiliated lawsuits and lobbying.
Human drivers remain a serious cost center for Uber, even as the company has shifted its compensation practices over the years to lower the cost of every trip it makes.
Besides having to pay drivers, Uber has to fight competitors to keep them working  within the Uber marketplace, which takes incentives, bonuses, advertising and a solid driver-side mobile app.
Of course, Uber has also spent money defending itself in multiple lawsuits filed by drivers around employment classification and more.
The company also reportedly spent hundreds of millions on improving its map-tech so it won’t have to rely on outside partners for its navigation systems and location data.
This year, Uber continued to make strategic acquisitions as well, buying up artificial intelligence startup Geometric Intelligence, and self-driving truck startup Otto, in a quest to become a leader in autonomous vehicles and logistics.
But as those acquisitions were taking shape, bookings slowed down for Uber towards the end of 2016.
That was to be expected, as soon as Uber backed off its efforts to compete in China. It merged its business there with that of Didi Chuxing, its strongest regional competitor, in exchange for a stake in the combined entity.
Though it meant fewer trips taken by Uber worldwide, that move freed up the company to focus on other initiatives like ramping up its UberEATS food delivery service to more than 50 cities.
Uber’s efforts to develop and test self-driving vehicles in Pittsburgh and most recently San Francisco are probably a bigger hit to the company’s bottom line.
Since autonomous vehicles could one day allow Uber to operate fleets with few or possibly no human drivers, it seems likely that investors will continue to support the company’s spending there.
But at the same time, competitors are flocking into this space, making the cost of recruiting and retaining talent sky high in a way it simply wasn’t before Google turned its self-driving car project into a full-fledged business unit called Waymo.
Because most of its competitors are also privately held companies— including Lyft in the U.S., Ola in India, Grab in Southeast Asia, and Gett in Europe—  it’s hard to know how Uber’s spending stacks up versus competitors precisely.
However, ridehailing industry insiders believe Uber is still spending more wisely on the ridesharing portion of its business than U.S. competitors Lyft. One person familiar with both companies’ financials told TechCrunch that Lyft spends some 50% more per trip than Uber does, namely giving discounts and promotions to riders and incentives to drivers.

BMW has already staked its claim in the self-driving production timeline, with plans to release an autonomous electric car by 2021. To help meet that goal, the carmaker is opening a dedicated facility aimed at developing connected and automated driving tech in Unterschleissheim, Germany near Munich. The facility is designed to begin operations in mid-2017, and will host more than 2,000 employees once it’s fully completed.
All aspects of development, all the way up to road tests, are planned for the new facility. The talent team at the location will pool a number of different groups from around the world, bringing together software engineers, machine learning specialists and more under one roof. BMW notes that this will make it possible to streamline the development process for its vehicles, allowing engineers to write code and then put it live in a test vehicle on location for instant trial and feedback.
BMW’s focus here appears to be on making its tech-focused development teams nimbler and more responsive.
Other automakers and suppliers have already taken similar steps, with many choosing to open engineering facilities in Silicon Valley in order to be closer to software development talent pools. Meanwhile, North American car companies like GM, which has a few different venues for its work on self-driving, including Detroit and Oshawa, are sticking closer to home.
BMW’s testing of its automated driving tech is currently set to begin near its new facility in Munich, with a target kick-off date of sometime in 2017.

Uber is going to meet with California’s Department of Motor Vehicles and the state’s Attorney General’s office on Wednesday afternoon, as first reported by San Francisco Business Times and confirmed by TechCrunch via the DMV. The meeting’s specific purpose wasn’t shared, but it’s definitely going to involve discussions around the company’s deployment of self-driving Uber SUVs in San Francisco.
The DMV could not provide any further info or details about the meeting to TechCrunch, but did say that lawyers from the state Attorney General’s office would be meeting with “representatives” from both Uber and the motor vehicle regulatory agency. Uber and the DMV have been trading statements in the press since Uber originally began its self-driving vehicle service (which uses semi-autonomous test cars with safety drivers and engineers on board) on December 14.
Uber did not seek a self-driving test permit from the DMV, and instead argued that its cars did not require this clearance because its vehicles are not truly autonomous yet, and require drivers at the wheel at all times. The DMV responded requiring that Uber fulfill its permitting requirement, as have 20 other companies testing autonomous tech on state roads, and the California Attorney General’s Office chimed in with a letter in support of the DMV’s position, noting that Uber would face legal repercussions, including potential injunctions, if it did not comply.
A meeting between the three could result in some kind of détente to the current stand-off, wherein Uber is continuing to operate its cars in clear defiance of the DMV and Attorney General’s requests. As Josh pointed out earlier today, this could all be a light show orchestrated by Uber to distract from more fundamental questions, and, if so, we might indeed see a more peaceable agreement prevail after Wednesday’s meeting.

670,Automakers aren’t really advertising electric vehicles,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/20/automakers-arent-really-advertising-electric-vehicles/,2016/12/20,"
There are more plug-in vehicles available now than there were a decade ago, and the sales of those vehicles are growing. Sales of electric vehicles are up about a third this year over last year, and November 2016 marked 14 consecutive months of record-setting EV sales in the U.S.
And yet the grand total of all plug-in vehicles sold in the U.S. in 2016 (not counting December) was just shy of 134,000. The total number of light-duty vehicles (cars, pickup trucks, SUVs, etc.) sold in November 2016 alone was 1.38 million — 10 times the EVs sold over a period of 11 months.
One reason EVs aren’t selling might be that they’re not being advertised. The Sierra Club commissioned a study that tracked automotive advertising in 2015. The result in a nutshell: manufacturers advertise for their gasoline-powered vehicles far more than for their electric-powered cars.
In a stark example, in 2015, Ford advertised the gas-powered Focus about 4,750 times to a national audience on tier-1 cable and broadcast TV channels. It advertised the electric-powered Focus about 200 times to a national TV audience. The Mercedes-Benz C-Class small gas-powered sedan was advertised about 1,400 times nationally, while the B-class EV got no national advertising time at all that year.
Nissan fared a little better in the results. Sort of. The gasoline-only Sentra was advertised 3,500 times nationally over the year, while the electric-only LEAF was advertised about 1,700 times — but only in California. But the Sentra was only advertised in California markets a couple hundred times, so markets matter.
In California, there are 22 electric models at dealerships, but in other states the pickings are far slimmer. The next best markets for EVs offer 14 different models; a half dozen states have zero EV models available at dealerships.
In some cases, it hardly matters if car makers advertise for these cars. Another Sierra Club project found that even if there are EVs at dealerships, they sometimes weren’t even charged up enough to test drive.
Tesla is at the top of this heap, as you’d expect. It only sells electric cars, it sells the most electric cars and its salespeople are knowledgeable about EVs. Also, they have charged cars to test drive.
Maybe the introduction of the Chevy Bolt and Chrysler Pacifica plug-in hybrid minivan will change the advertising landscape next year. Maybe the nine states following California’s zero-emissions vehicles (ZEV) standards will convince auto manufacturers to advertise their plug-in cars. Electric vehicles don’t work everywhere for everyone, but they work in a lot of places for a lot of people. Maybe that’s all the ads have to say to convince skeptical buyers to test drive a charged EV.

671,"Honda’s CES teaser reveals community car smarts, personal mobility plans",https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/20/hondas-ces-teaser-reveals-community-car-smarts-personal-mobility-plans/,2016/12/20,"


Honda is going to reveal a number of announcements around its forthcoming “cooperative mobility ecosystem” at this year’s CES in January, and the car maker just dropped a teaser to preview some of what it’s going to talk about.
Three new features are teased in the short video, including “Safe Swarm,” a trademark Honda applied for in November this year. It looks likely to be some form of vehicle-to-vehicle communication network that will let cars more safely negotiate roads with shared info, but it’s hard to tell from the graphics how this will work exactly.
The second tease is Uni-Cub, which looks to be a personal mobility transportation device for individual use. This is also a big area for automakers in general now, who are looking to address personal transit as a way to capture more of the aging population market. Hyundai previewed similar projects it plans to demo at CES earlier this week.
Finally, the teaser shows its NeuV concept vehicle, which the carmaker revealed earlier this month will be the first automated commuter EV design with an artificial intelligence “emotion engine” on board. The concept design has been made in tandem with the company behind Pepper, the service bot with AI interaction onboard.
Sounds like Honda will have a lot of future-focused announcements to make at the annual consumer electronics show, but the interesting question will be how far out this future actually is.

672,Magna taps Innoviz for LiDAR to add to its autonomous driving system,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/20/magna-taps-innoviz-for-lidar-to-add-to-is-autonomous-driving-system/,2016/12/20,"
Global automaker supply leader Magna International is teaming up with LiDAR-maker Innoviz to help fill out its sensor fusion picture for self-driving vehicles, the companies announced Tuesday. The addition of Innoviz’s LiDAR sensor means Magna’s suite now includes carmakers, ultrasonic and RADAR fusion sensing capabilities, which essentially covers the range of available sensing techniques used in creating a three-dimensional, highly accurate and live image of the world surrounding an autonomous vehicle.
Innoviz will be showing off prototypes of upcoming LiDAR hardware it plans to bring to production at CES this year. The key to wider use of LiDAR in autonomous systems is reducing size and cost, and that’s definitely going to be true for Magna, which is going to be attempting to sell its self-driving systems as a Tier 1 supplier to automakers, providing them with everything they need to field production self-driving cars once the tech gets to where it needs to be, and regulation also catches up to the pace of industry progress.
Innoviz is pursuing solid-sate LiDAR tech, which will help reduce cost and size of components by minimizing the number of moving parts required in a LiDAR sensor’s construction. The InnovizOne it’s demoing at CES has a 200m detection range, and yet costs just $100 per unit, with a 5x5x5cm footprint and improved durability vs. previously LiDAR designs.
Magna, which is a key supplier to essentially ever major automaker in operation right now, has been investing heavily in autonomous driving technology, but has previously cautioned that it still believes true self-driving tech won’t be widely available to consumers for a long while yet, with cost accounting for part of that.

673,"Uber’s self-driving cars put cyclists at risk, warns bike advocate group",https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/20/ubers-self-driving-cars-bike-risk/,2016/12/20,"
Uber, the transportation-on-demand behemoth, courted controversy this past week when it started to test its self-driving cars on public roads in San Francisco without the state’s permission.
Today, Uber drew even more heat, as bike advocates warned that the test vehicles have a so-called “right hook” turning problem, which can put cyclists at grave risk.
In this scenario, when a vehicle turns right from its lane, it can potentially cut off a cyclist at a corner, rather than merging into the bike lane before safely completing a right turn.
The San Francisco Bike Coalition said this is one of the main causes for bike-car collisions, a fact that it had pointed out when consulting on videos for Uber earlier this year:
This kind of turn is… known to be one of the primary causes of collisions between cars and people who bike resulting in serious injury or fatality. It’s also an unsafe practice that we address in all of the safety curriculum we offer to professional drivers, including the videos we consulted on for Uber as recently as this fall.
As The Guardian first reported Uber is aware of the problem, but has continued to keep its self-driving vehicles in circulation.
As a stop-gap measure, the company has instructed human drivers to take over when they approach a right turn on a street with a bike lane. An Uber spokesperson told TechCrunch in an email:
“We take safety very seriously. We’re aware of this and we’re working to address it. All our vehicles operators have been instructed to take over our vehicles when they’re making these turns.”
While Uber is working on reprogramming its vehicles, apparently, it is not expected to issue updates over-the-air as Tesla has done to upgrade its autopilot systems.
In San Francisco, Uber’s self-driving cars return to the garage every four to five hours. System updates and other maintenance issues are handled there in-house, the company confirmed.
Before the “right hook” issue became widely reported, California Attorney General Kamala Harris, who is also Senator-elect for California, called for Uber’s tests to stop until the company attains a special permit from the DMV to proceed.
Uber is a founding member of the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets.
David Strickland, general counsel for the coalition declined to comment on Uber’s approach, specifically, to testing its self-driving vehicles in San Francisco.
Speaking through a press representative for the group, he said, “The Coalition remains dedicated to working with policymakers on bringing the vision of safe, fully self-driving vehicles to U.S. roads and highways.”
 
Update: This post has been updated with new information and comments from both Uber and the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets.

674,New York City brings smartphone payments to metered parking,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/19/new-york-city-parking/,2016/12/19,"
Starting this week, metered parking spots in midtown Manhattan are going mobile with a new system that lets drivers pay via smartphone. The new ParkNYC app is tied to a car’s license plate number, working along the lines of an EZPass.
Drivers enter their parking zone and the amount of time they’re parking and it goes to work deducting money from the account. Drivers can add parking time remotely via the app to avoid a ticket.

The system fulfills Mayor de Blasio’s promise to roll out a smarter metered parking system by year’s end — and with a full week or so to spare. The system goes live to select spots in midtown, between 14th and 59th street, with plans to roll it out to all of the city’s 85,000 Mini-Meter parking spots by the end of next summer. The Department of Transportation will identify participating spots with new signs and decals.
The app is currently available for iOS and Android.

675,Hyundai’s self-driving system aims at affordability,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/19/hyundais-self-driving-system-aims-at-affordability/,2016/12/19,"
Automaker Hyundai wants you to know that it’s also embracing the race to autonomous driving — but it’s also hoping to do so in a way that differs from the approaches of most automakers, in striving for tech that will both be available in vehicles owned by individuals, and that will actually be affordable for a good portion of car buyers.
Hyundai debuted its self-driving tech this week, with the first public rides provided on the streets of Las Vegas ahead of CES in January. Hyundai’s using the Ioniq as the base for its test vehicle, and surprisingly its prototype vehicles actually look pretty much like stock Ioniq’s — lacking the crown of large, obvious sensors that we’ve become accustomed to seeing in self-driving cars brave enough to tackle city streets.
That doesn’t mean these cars are running blind; Hyundai’s vehicles include four optical cameras behind the windshield, front- and side-facing LiDAR units, front mid- and long-range radars and rear-facing radars, too. That’s still a more conservative sensor loadout than you might get on, say, Uber’s autonomous vehicles, but there’s a reason for Hyundai’s restraint: a smaller overall volume of input means less onerous compute requirements on board the vehicle, which ultimately means lower cost for the system overall.
Hyundai’s looking to fill gaps in its overall sensor picture using downloadable, high-accuracy mapping data, which means an area needs to be fully mapped out before autonomous driving can take place there using these vehicles. But as Engadget found in its test drive, if the mapping is there, the system seems to handle on-road obstacles, like pedestrians, with ease, or at least it did during a Las Vegas public road demo.
The important thing about Hyundai’s approach is that it might make it possible to include autonomous-driving features on an affordable, even entry-level vehicle, whereas others targeting self-driving systems for individual-owned cars are generally planning to offer them as high-end options on high-end vehicles, like Volvo.

Hyundai says that its work in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are helping chart its path toward full autonomy, with a planned sensor standardization deadline on vehicles and functional benchmark in place in the 2019-2021 range. Full autonomy still has a number of barriers to overcome, however, beyond the technical — including regulatory and customer acceptance — so vehicles with full autonomous capabilities in the hands of everyday drivers are still quite a while off.
Still, Hyundai is already thinking ahead to mass production, and that could be a big help in the future, especially if the cost of components like LiDAR decrease considerably between now and then, as they appear likely to. Aiming for affordability for individuals, and not just fleets or luxury buyers, is also a noble undertaking. Tesla, it’s worth noting, also seems to have interest in making this happen with the sensor suite and compute stack that will ship in the Model 3, but Hyundai’s approach still could do a lot for the affordability of autonomy at scale.

676,Here’s how Montréal is turning to Bluetooth to address traffic congestion,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/19/heres-how-montreal-is-turning-to-bluetooth-to-address-traffic-congestion/,2016/12/19,"
Connected city infrastructure and cars that talk back could potentially do a lot to help ease traffic conditions, but in the meantime, the city of Montréal in Quebec, Canada is using a more immediately available tech to try to address its urban traffic problem: Bluetooth. The city has installed over a hundred Bluetooth signal detectors over the past couple of months, with the aim of being able to monitor and analyze traffic patterns in real-time daily, instead of just once a year during an annual traffic study.
The new project, described by Radio-Canada, will track Bluetooth devices being used by people in vehicles, tagging their unique MAC address and then looking for it again at other sites to judge how quickly cars are moving through traffic. The data gathered isn’t tied to any specific individuals, but can help the city keep an eye on how the flow of cars are moving through a city.
Keeping a closer eye on traffic patterns is definitely helpful in terms of city planning, making it possible to do stuff that could positively impact congestion throughout the year, instead of just as the result of a once-annual review. And Bluetooth tracking hardware is relatively cheap to install, and doesn’t require any special vehicle-to-infrastructure communications tech to be built-in to cars on the road.
Montréal has another plan to put Bluetooth to use in helping with roadway traffic, too – it hopes to install hockey puck-sized sensors in street spaces starting in 2018, so that it can know when a spot is empty and direct drivers to those locations. City transportation officials have found that a significant percentage of congestion results from drivers circling looking for a spot, so being able to guide them directly could potentially cut down on a lot of unnecessary cars on the road.

677,BlackBerry opens a research center for self-driving tech in Canada,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/19/blackberry-opens-a-research-center-for-self-driving-tech-in-canada/,2016/12/19,"
A former smartphone powerhouse wants to be an instrumental part of the coming smart car revolution, and BlackBerry is deepening its investment int he field with a new autonomous driving research center opening for business on Monday in Ottawa, Reuters reports. BlackBerry is one of three initial organizations to get clearance from the government of Ontario to test self-driving vehicles in the province on public roads.
BlackBerry’s bet on self-driving is mainly riding on QNX, the company it acquired in 2010, and whose software later became the basis for its BlackBerry 10 mobile operating system. QNX had been a part of Harman International at the time, and was focused on infotainment system software even back then.
For its initial tests, BlackBerry will be using Ford Lincoln vehicles retrofitted with autonomous vehicle hardware and software, and the former smartphone maker also has an agreement in place with Ford to work with it directly, with an expanded mandate that includes not only infotainment, but also security software and likely also autonomous driving features, though neither BlackBerry nor ford are getting quiet so specific about their work together just yet.
BlackBerry may be able to ride the interest in self-driving tech to renewed relevance, but it’s also going to face a lot of competition. At the software level, companies like Delphi are looking to provide production-ready autonomous hardware and software to automakers, and a number of other players are also in the space, including chipmakers like Qualcomm (through NXP), Intel and Nvidia, and while these companies focus on hardware, they’re also developing software that they could end up supplying to push sales of their primary business.
The new research facility will be an extension of BlackBerry’s existing QNX operations in Ottawa, and will also focus on advanced driver assist features like automatic emergency breaking and intelligent cruise as well as development of full autonomy.

678,OS builder Thundersoft buys UI maker Rightware for $68M to expand in automotive,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/19/os-builder-thundersoft-buys-ui-maker-rightware-for-68m-to-expand-in-automotive/,2016/12/19,"
Thundersoft, a company out of China that designs operating systems for drones and other connected devices, has made an acquisition to drive deeper into automotive technology: it has paid €64 million ($68 million; RMB471 million) for Rightware, a company out of Helsinki that develops graphical user interfaces for connected devices, with a special focus on automotive: its Kanzi product is currently used in some 20 automotive brands, the company said.
The deal should close in early 2017.
Thundersoft makes operating systems and other platform tools for device makers. Acquiring a company like Rightware that focuses on graphical interfaces for automotive systems positions Thundersoft as a stronger offering for customers looking at end-to-end solutions.
There is a clear opportunity here, since car makers are turning to outside partners like these to both provide technology but also guidance in how to navigate themselves as the car industry continues to evolve. (This has also been some of the logic driving car groups buying into mapping companies, and partnering with tech companies to build and develop new in-car systems.)
Thundersoft, which was founded in 2008 and is publicly traded in China, has taken strategic backing from companies like Qualcomm and Intel. It is using the acquisition not only to build out its business in the car industry, but also to help it grow more outside of China. Rightware is its first acquisition outside of China.
“The automotive market is one of the fastest growing segments for Thundersoft, and we are providing in-vehicle infotainment and cluster OS solutions to our customers worldwide,” said Larry Geng, CEO of Thundersoft, in a statement. “Cars are getting smarter — with rich applications and fully optimized OS solutions. Rightware has the best user experience design technology, which will be featured in more connected cars in the market. In combination with Rightware’s unique technology, design knowhow and world-class talent, we can bring more value to our customers and transform the automotive industry with our innovations.”
Rightware — which will continue to operate as an independent company, currently employing 50 but also now hiring more — has been around since 2009 but its last round of disclosed funding was a $5 million round back in 2014, so it seems like this, in part, is one way of expanding its business in a climate where remaining a smaller independent player may have been more challenging.
“Kanzi is expected to power over 25 million cars by 2022. With Thundersoft, we can expand this footprint further and support our customers even better,” said Jonas Geust, CEO of Rightware, in a statement. “We see that the specialisation within the global automotive industry software will continue. This creates a huge possibility for us to position Kanzi as the industry standard software solution. The arrangement further strengthens our presence in the growing Asian automotive market and complements our strong footprint in the European and American automotive markets.”
Another notable point is that Rightware originally started out focusing on building a platform for graphic interfaces for all kinds of devices, with the emphasis on phones and tablets, before focusing on cars. This in itself is an interesting shift that speaks to the pace of change in the car world today, and how many have come to see it as a key piece of “hardware” while mobile has somewhat slowed down in growth and development as customers have consolidated essentially on two platforms, Android and iOS. 
Rightware said that current management will remain and “re-invest in the company” as part of the deal. (This presumably means that they have kept a stake in the transaction at least for the initial earn out.) Existing shareholders include Finnish Industry Investment Ltd, Inventure Fund Ky, Nexit Ventures, the current management and the company founders.

679,Here’s our first look at Waymo’s new self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/18/heres-our-first-look-at-waymos-new-self-driving-chrysler-pacifica-minivans/,2016/12/18,"
Waymo, the newly-minted Alphabet company that was previously Google’s self-driving car project, has a new addition to its vehicle fleet: 100 Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans, which were produced by Fiat Chrysler specifically for the purpose of making them fully autonomous using Waymo’s tech, onboard computer power, sensors and telematics. The 100 new cars will join Waymo’s other self-driving vehicles in active service on public roads for more testing starting early next year.
These vehicles were created through a close partnership between Waymo and FCA that actually saw engineering teams from both companies co-located at a Michigan engineering site, and testing of tech through the development process happened both in Chelsea, Michigan, and Yucca, Arizona on the FCA side, and at Waymo’s own test facilities in California.
While the Chrysler Pacificas used are based on the 2017 production model that consumers can buy, changes were made to the vehicles’ electrical, powertrain and structural systems, as well as to the vehicle chassis itself, in order to make them better suited for using Waymo’s tech. This results in a much tighter integration than if the Alphabet company had just purchased Chrysler vehicles off the line and done their own aftermarket modifications on stock vehicles. Still, from project outset to these being ready to enter service took only six months, according to FCA.

In a blog post, Waymo CEO John Krafcik noted that the addition of the Pacifica, with its minivan form factor, to their test fleet, helps better represent the full range of vehicles and passenger needs among its range of self-driving vehicles. Prototypes in private tests have actually already seen a range of tests, including over 200 hours exposed to extreme weather, Krafcik says in the blog post.
Bloomberg recently reported that Waymo is working with Fiat Chrysler on a larger fleet deployment of semi-autonomous Chrysler Pacifica vehicles for a ride-sharing service open to consumers, which could debut as early as next year. These 100 vehicles were previously announced by Fiat Chrysler and the Alphabet company earlier this year for testing, but any larger service launch will require more vehicles, according to the report.

680,California Attorney General gives Uber notice on self-driving cars in San Francisco,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/17/california-attorney-general-gives-uber-notice-on-self-driving-cars-in-san-francisco/,2016/12/17,"
The California Department of Motor Vehicles sent Uber a notice asking it to terminate its pilot self-driving car service in San Francisco last week, but Uber has continued to operate its vehicles in spite of that order. Now, the California State Department of Justice has followed up, with an order from the Attorney General’s office that adds some teeth to the DMV’s earlier request.
The DMV has noted that Uber would be subject to legal action in its original request for Uber to stop its tests and pursue permitting, as 20 other companies testing autonomous vehicles have done with the state regulator. But this letter insists that Uber “immediately” (emphasis int the original) remove its test vehicles from any public roads in the state, and that it seek out the appropriate permit before reinstating any use of its self-driving cars.
If Uber fails to meet these demands, “the Attorney General will seek injunctive and other appropriate relief,” according to the letter signed by CA Supervising Deputy Attorney Generals Miguel A. Neri and Fiel D. Tigno.
Uber has maintained that its vehicles are not truly autonomous and therefore require no permit, but it’s a difficult position to maintain then the ride hailing company has also been touting its self-driving tech’s proficiency to media.

There’s nothing like driving your nearly-empty Tesla up to a Supercharger station for a top-up and finding every spot taken by other cars — probably all charged up and ready to go. Where are their drivers? How dare they? Tesla shares your anger and will soothe it by giving those drivers a different kind of charge.
You know, the money kind.

The company announced today that until it can make the cars move themselves once charged — probably not that far off, actually — drivers will need to undertake that task, and do it within 5 minutes of the car hitting 100 percent. Once that 5 minutes passes, a $0.40 per minute fee will begin to assess — retroactively inclusive of the first 5, so you’re looking at $2 right off the bat.
“One would never leave a car parked at a gas station right at the pump and the same rule applies with Superchargers,” read Tesla’s announcement.
How will one know that it’s done and you need to scoot? Why, one will get an alert on one’s phone, of course, via the Tesla app. One already does, in fact. So one never had any excuse.
“To be clear, this change is purely about increasing customer happiness and we hope to never make any money from it,” the announcement also reads. What an odd thing to say! Get that money, Tesla. I predict a couple thousand bucks in the first month. If you don’t want it, give it to someone who does.

682,Uber continues self-driving vehicle testing in SF in defiance of DMV,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/16/uber-continues-self-driving-vehicle-testing-in-sf-in-defiance-of-dmv/,2016/12/16,"
Uber won’t stop operating self-driving vehicles in San Francisco, despite an order from the California Department of Motor Vehicles to do just that.
The DMV says Uber needs a permit to test its autonomous vehicles, but Uber argues that its vehicles aren’t autonomous at all and therefore it doesn’t need a permit.
“We respectfully disagree with the California Department of Motor Vehicles legal interpretation of today’s autonomous regulations, in particular that Uber needs a testing permit to operate its self-driving cars in San Francisco,” Uber’s self-driving car lead Anthony Levandowski said in a statement to reporters.
Levandowski repeatedly compared Uber’s self-driving cars, which have been on the road in Pittsburgh since mid-September and in San Francisco this week, to Tesla’s self-driving technology. Tesla owners don’t need a special permit to drive their cars, he argued — so why should the Uber engineers who currently sit behind the wheel of Uber’s self-driving vehicles?
In order to be considered truly autonomous, Levandowski said an Uber vehicle would need to be able to drive itself without human intervention and oversight. “We believe Tesla is right and our vehicles are just like Tesla’s. The vehicle is not capable of driving without a human operator. As long as that’s the case, it’s not an autonomous vehicle,” he said.
The DMV, of course, disagrees. The agency ordered Uber to stop operating its self-driving cars in San Francisco after a dashcam video captured an autonomous Uber speeding through a red light. The DMV warned Uber in a letter that the company will be confronted with “legal action, including but not limited to, seeking injunctive relief” if it does not stop the pilot program.
The difference the DMV might see between Tesla and Uber? Tesla requires drivers using its Autopilot mode to keep their hands on the wheel, while Uber’s engineers hover their hands a few inches away from the steering wheels of their self-driving vehicles. In a Tesla, a driver will receive auditory and visual warnings if he takes his hands off the wheel, and if he doesn’t put them back on, the car will gradually slow down and that hazard lights will turn on.
Uber invited journalists to ride and drive its self-driving cars this summer, and vehicle operators weren’t required to have their hands on the wheel.
While Tesla has announced plans for a more fully-autonomous vehicle, the cars are still being tested — and Tesla has a DMV permit for those tests.
Levandowski said that Uber’s defiance represents “an important issue of principle about when companies can operate self-driving cars on the roads and the uneven application of statewide rules across very similar types of technology.”
Regulations on self-driving vehicles vary state-by-state, and Levandowski was asked why Uber couldn’t just go test its vehicles somewhere else since California regulators clearly aren’t welcoming. He said that Uber’s engineers deserve to see their work displayed in the city where they work.
“We want to see our technology drive in the city we live in and the city we work in,” he said.
Despite the DMV’s order, Levandowski said Uber’s self-driving cars will remain on San Francisco streets, picking up passengers.

683,"Mercedes-Benz debuts Croove, its own car-sharing network",https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/16/mercedes-benz-debuts-croove-its-own-car-sharing-network/,2016/12/16,"
It’s become a well-trod refrain, but carmakers are looking at what comes after ownership, and car-sharing between individual owners and renters is one of those models. Mercedes-Benz has begun its own car-share service that adopts that approach – Croove, a platform that has now launched as a pilot in Munich, Germany.
Croove is pure peer-to-peer car rental model, where renters use an app to make choices about what model, trim level and other options they’re looking for in a car. The app will poll its database of registered vehicle owners in the area and find out what’s available for the time and duration need by the renter, and connect the dots. Mercedes isn’t limiting what kind of cars can be on the platform – it’s available to all makes of cars, with the limitation being that the car is in good condition, and isn’t older than 15 years.
Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler is no stranger to car sharing; the company owns and operates Car2Go, a shared vehicle platform where it offers a fleet of Smart and Mercedes vehicles to members who use them on an as-needed basis and pay only for the time they drive. This is a very different approach, however, and notable for being automaker agnostic.
Typically you’d expect carmakers to want to use a service like this to promote its own vehicles, and indeed that’s how they’ve approach services like Zipcar in the past – as a showroom or test ride opportunity for casual drivers who might consider a purchase later on. GM’s Maven has that as one of its explicit service goals, in fact.
Croove is much more like its independent competitors, however; Turo, which just launched in the UK, does the same thing, connecting car owners with renters regardless of vehicle type, and others like easyCar Club in Europe are doing the same.
The decision to open up the platform might just be about making sure Mercedes-Benz can accrue enough data about the pilot to judge whether this is a worthwhile effort for expansion using its own cars, but it’s more likely that the carmaker is not treating this primarily as lead-generation for vehicle sales. Instead, like other automakers making more serious investments in alternative transportation models, Mercedes seems to be focused more on what comes next for automakers when selling cars to people might not be their primary business.
Car sharing also becomes something that Mercedes-Benz and other carmakers can use as a purchase incentive, however – almost like an alternative form of financing, which can be used to help defray the cost of ownership. Even if Croove is open to all vehicles, it’d be relatively easy for Mercedes to use it as a sales push by showing how much a potential vehicle buyer could potentially earn back towards their lease or finance payments by also renting their car out occasionally on the platform.

684,Mercedes launches car-sharing service Croove,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/15/mercedes-launches-car-sharing-service-croove/,2016/12/15,"
For something like a century, car makers have sold one car to one person one time and then waited for them to wear out that car and come back to the dealership for another one. Increasingly, that model is outmoded, and Mercedes-Benz is putting another nail in that model’s coffin with Croove.
The car-sharing service launched in Munich this month with a couple of twists. Croove is a peer-to-peer sharing service, unlike fellow Daimler-owned service car2go or BMW’s ReachNow. Those services provide a fleet of cars to be shared in a city. Croove is open to anyone with any brand of car — private cars included.
Croove is only available as an iOS app for now, though Mercedes promises to have an Android version available soon, plus a desktop site. Requirements for sharing are simple; owners fill out a profile for their vehicle, including any options it has. The app then walks the owner through setting the price to rent the car. The vehicle does have to be “in good condition and no more than 15 years old,” according to a press release.
It’s just as simple for renters to rent, as long as they’re at least 21 years old and have a license. They use the app to find a car that suits their needs and contact the owner. Then the two users can either arrange an in-person key exchange, or the renter can pay a bit more for pickup and delivery by the owner. The app includes a checklist to use when looking for damage after the rental is concluded. Mercedes is looking to develop a PIN-based keyless function to make the exchange even more frictionless.
Croove is part of Mercedes’s CASE strategy, which stands for connectivity, autonomous driving, sharing and electric drive systems. Mercedes announced the creation of this separate, independent entity in September to advance technologies in these spaces from ideas to reality. The EQ electric mobility brand, which includes the Generation EQ concept vehicle, also falls under this particular umbrella.

685,GM will begin testing and building self-driving cars in Michigan,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/15/gm-will-begin-testing-and-building-self-driving-cars-in-michigan/,2016/12/15,"
GM is going to start building its next generation of self-driving vehicles at the Michigan plant where it builds its Chevrolet Bolt, the company’s CEO Mary Barra announced Thursday. It will also be testing vehicles on public roads in metro Detroit, GM said. GM is already testing self-driving vehicles using autonomous systems created by Cruise, the startup it acquired earlier this year, in both San Francisco, California and Scottsdale, Arizona.
The Michigan testing is clear to proceed after state governor Rick Snyder signed into law legislation that allows expanded testing of autonomous vehicles on public roads by companies and organizations. It also allows the purchase and use of autonomous vehicles by consumers once the tech is ready, and the use of such cars by ride-hailing providers, including companies like Uber or those run by automakers themselves.
Barra explained in a LinkedIn post that Michigan provides a lot of variety in terms of real-world testing conditions compared to its existing trial cities, including a “wide range of road, weather and climate conditions,” which include snow in significant volume and much colder temperatures. She notes that their test areas will now cover everything from “desert heat[…] to crowded streets” across the cities where they have a presence. As of September, Cruise had around 30 self-driving test cars in operation in SF and Scottsdale combined.
In the blog post, Barra noted that GM is committed to an autonomous vehicle future in large part because of the benefits they provide customers due to potential improvements in “safety, convenience and quality of life.” Barra cited 2015 traffic statistics from the U.S. Department of Transportation, which counted over 35,000 traffic-related deaths, around 90 percent of which were due to human driver error.
In an interview with Barra captured by CNBC at a press conference in Detroit announcing the news, Barra explained why she believes GM has an advantage when it comes to competing with other companies developing autonomous driving tech.
“We have 100 years of really understanding vehicles, putting them on the road, making sure we have a safe, high-quality vehicle,” she told reporters. “When you take autonomous, electrification, connectivity, I think we are going to have a very special offering to the consumer.”
Barra said that while there are over 100 people working in Silicon Valley on GM’s autonomous driving systems, they will “work seamlessly” with teams based in Michigan as the new manufacturing of its next-generation assembly facility near Lake Orion, Michigan, kicks off early next year. The Orion plant is where GM assembles the Bolt EV, which is the car GM uses as the base of its current-generation Cruise autonomous test cars.
“In today’s work world, location isn’t so important,” she added, regarding the distributed nature of GM’s autonomous engineering efforts.

686,BMW and Daimler could bring their car-sharing services together,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/15/bmw-and-daimler-could-bring-their-car-sharing-services-together/,2016/12/15,"
Carmakers are building alternative models to vehicle ownership like it’s going out of style (it probably is). Two of those side bets on collaborative transportation might be coming together, according to a new report that says Daimler and BMW are considering merging their car-sharing services Car2Go and DriveNow.
The combo is designed as a way to better compete with rivals from outside the automotive industry like Uber, reports Germany’s Manager Magazin, which are also putting pressure on ownership in urban markets. Daimler’s Car2Go and BMW’s DriveNow offer short-term rentals of vehicles from their respective owners, which is more similar to a service like Zipcar than to a ride-hailing offering like Uber, but the fact remains that both models compete with car ownership at the most fundamental level.
Both DriveNow and Car2Go would retain their own individual branding, but combined operations would help both automakers save money and chart a quicker path to larger profits from their mobility services divisions, according to the Manager report. Other possibilities on the table include incorporating other transportation services offers by BMW and Daimler, including MyTaxi and ParkNow, for instance.
Volkwagen’s Moia is another recent example of an effort by a major carmaker to build out its mobility services portfolio, and Ford recently acquired on-demand carpooling startup Chariot through its own Mobility Solutions subsidiary.

687,BMW’s HoloActive Touch in-car interface offers tactile feedback on a floating display,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/15/bmws-holoactive-touch-in-car-interface-offers-tactile-feedback-on-a-floating-display/,2016/12/15,"
BMW is doing something pretty sci-fi with the interior of its vehicles at CES – it’s showing off a new HoloActive Touch system, which is a touch sensitive display for showing the driver information about music, navigation and more, which appears to float in air, and which also provides actual felt, tactile feedback in response to interactions.
The new interactive holograph-style display is part of BMW’s i Inside Future study, the company says, which is designed to give CES attendees a glimpse at what it might look like to use cars that are fully connected and offer full self-driving features. HoloActive Touch incorporates heads-up display features, too, meaning it could span the driver’s field of view and provide a more immersive way to access info about your car and your ride.
As for the tech used to make the interface feel somewhat physical, even though you’re just poking around in mid-air, we’ve heard it might be sourced from Ultrahaptics, a company whose whole mission is to make it possible to feel things including “invisible buttons and dials” when you want them to be tangible, and then not when you don’t.
On its website, Ultrahaptics lists automotive application potential as providing the means with which automakers can let drivers “know their gesture has been received, without taking their eyes off the road.” With any touchscreen interface, providing actual tactile feedback is key in a driving context, since it’s what will prevent distraction, and, hopefully, accidents.
Ultrahaptics uses ultrasonic (sound that can’t be detected by human) waves to provide the sensation of physical touch for objects that aren’t really there. Based on previous CES demos, it feels remarkably lifelike and could indeed be convincing when paired with floating visuals of dials and buttons.
Interacting with a floating screen, tactile feedback or not, still seems like a recipe for distraction. This is still a concept, however, and it very well could provide a more natural interface in actual use and with further development leading to actual productization. BMW’s iDrive, which centered around using a puck-type controller to navigate infotainment features, was considered difficult to use initially but has improved considerably in recent years.

688,Car sharing network Turo launches in the UK,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/14/car-sharing-network-turo-launches-in-the-uk/,2016/12/14,"
A lot of us have cars, but not a lot of us use cars – estimates suggest our cars are sitting unused as much as 95 percent of the time, which is kind of insane if you think about it. That’s why things like Turo exists, which lets people rent out their vehicles on-demand via an app, Airbnb style. Turo is expanding to the UK today, but its debut there will actually focus on rental fleets, first, and then eventually explore opening up the service to individual car owner, in a bit of a reversal of its typical expansion strategy.
“We’re launching first with what were kind of late adopters of our model in the U.S. We stayed for many years exclusively focused on individuals renting their cars,” explained Turo CEO Andre Haddad in an interview. “We’ve seen in the intervening years some of these individuals become rental entrepreneurs, with 5, 10 or 15 cars. And more recently we’ve seen small rental companies come on board.”
Those “mom-and-pop” rental operations are the focus of the expansion for the UK launch, Haddad said. They tend to want to compete with the big rental chains, but often have only one or a few locations, and no big marketing or tech development budgets of their larger rivals. Haddad said that this approach seemed like the “smartest and fastest” way to enter the market, given what they’re seeing in terms of user searches and the concentration of geographic interest.
Turo is seeing a decent chunk of its users go on to become effectively small rental operations themselves, and part of what’s driving that is how the economics work for people who list their vehicles on its service. Turo has seen that drivers can recoup enough revenue from renting their cars to cover their lease for the month in as few as a couple of days, letting them enjoy cars they wouldn’t normally be able to own because of financial limitations.

So why the UK for this first overseas expansion? It’s a matter of interest, essentially, as gleaned by observing data gathered from existing activity on the Turo platform.
“15 to 20 percent of our business is now international, and what we found was that UK travelers were the largest group within that 15 to 20 percent,” Haddad said. “What was fun to see was that they were booking sort of the American classics, like the Mustang that they can’t easily find in the UK, or the Jeep Wrangler.”
But it’s not just about where users are coming from; people looking to rent were also looking to the UK and London for rentals, even though it wasn’t one of the markets in which Turo operated at the time.
“They’ve been using Turo more than any non North American group, on the one hand, and on the other , as we were looking at the data coming out of our platform searches and our traffic, we found a lot of people searching for our cars in London and other locations.”
London was Turo’s largest non-North American city in terms of interest, hence the decision to start there with its UK vehicle availability. Haddad says that it’s generally “really excited” about the potential for its model to spread further internationally, however, so it’s reasonable to assume London is just a start.

689,Uber ordered to stop self-driving vehicle service in San Francisco,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/14/uber-ordered-to-stop-self-driving-vehicle-service-in-san-francisco/,2016/12/14,"
Uber has been ordered by state regulators to stop using self-driving cars in California, according to the Associated Press, at least until it secures the necessary permit issued by the state to allow companies to test autonomous vehicles on public roads. The California Department of Motor Vehicles issued a statement saying Uber was expected to secure such a permit, but Uber maintained that it did not require this clearance because its vehicles were not fully self-driving and have a driver onboard at all times.
The self-driving pilot program in San Francisco is an expansion of Uber’s original launch of the service in Pittsburgh earlier this year. This city expansion featured Volvo’s XC90 SUV, a third-generation version of Uber’s autonomous test vehicle.
Uber said earlier that it did not intend to pursue this permit, the requirements for which are detailed by the California DMV on a site dedicated to autonomous vehicle operation on public roads. In a letter to Uber telling it to end the launch of its self-driving service, the DMV states that Uber will face “legal action, including but not limited to, seeking injunctive relief” if it does not comply.
Prior to the state regulators explicitly ordering Uber to stop, Uber’s vehicle was caught on camera apparently running a red light, thought the circumstances of this incident aren’t known at this time (including whether this was while the car was human or computer-operated when it ran the light). Uber told TechCrunch it is looking into this matter as “safety is a top priority.”
That means it’s only been less than one day since Uber started its test, had its first documented incident with the vehicles and was ordered by the state to stop what it was doing. This definitely looks more like the risk-happy Uber of the early days that often acted in contravention of local regulators to achieve its business goals.
“It seems to me from my reading of the law that while this [permit pertains to the] concept of an autonomous vehicle, there’s a human in it [in Uber’s case],” Uber advisor and shareholder Bradley Tusk told TechCrunch in an interview. “Beyond that, to take a bit of the excitement out of it, Uber often does something innovative and new, regulators don’t quite comprehend it at first, then it gets worked out.”
We’ve reached out to both Uber and the California DMV for further comment. The California DMV provided the following letter, which it sent to Uber earlier this afternoon.

California-based Lucid Motors revealed its first car today, a fully electric sedan aimed at the “executive” market, with a 400-mile range rating from its onboard 100kWh battery, a 2.5-second 0-60 mph time and a target market date of 2018. The vehicle prototype was shown off today at a special unveiling event in Fremont, California.
Lucid’s founding team includes CTO Peter Rawlinson, a former Tesla team member, as well as Derek Jenkins, previously of Mazda and VW and BMW alum Brian Barron. The Lucid Motors plan is to build these electric vehicles starting in 2017 in Arizona, at a new factory facility that’s set to bring around 2,000 new jobs to the sate according to the company and Arizona Governor Doug Ducey.

Rawlinson previously noted that the cars would boast a combined 1,000 horsepower across its electric motors, and that there would be a version made available with a max 400-mile estimated range. The vehicle will also have some autonomous features, according to Rawlinson’s previous statements.
Previous prototypes have been displayed with the signature black and white camouflage of vehicles worn prior to their official debut, but we did have an idea of what the Air would look like. It’s more impressive without the obfuscating cladding, however, if perhaps a bit more sober and sensible looking than its competition from Tesla, for instance.
That “executive” moniker that Lucid keeps throwing around with this vehicle is a pretty good indicator of what you can expect in terms of price, which hasn’t yet been made official. Over $100,000 is where Lucid is setting expectations for early releases, with lots of options included.

The sedan approach is also more pronounced in the Lucid Air’s design than it is with the Model S, which suggests it may be looking to compete more with vehicles like the BMW 7 series (in fact, it previously released images comparing it to that and the Mercedes S-Class, like the one above).
Lucid also has a partnership in place with Samsung SDI, the battery-focused subsidiary of the Korean tech giant. Lucid has raised over $130 million across three rounds of venture funding, including from the Chinese Environmental Fund.
Lucid’s vehicle looks interesting, but it’s going to be a very different market in 2018 when this car launches, with EV entries from many of the major luxury brands joining the fray at around the same time. The challenge will be getting to the starting line, but new players still might have some advantages over legacy automakers when it comes to electric, even if the established brands are accelerating their EV plans.

691,Uber says self-driving car ran red light due to “human error”,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/14/uber-looking-into-incident-of-self-driving-car-running-a-red-light-captured-on-dashcam/,2016/12/14,"

Update 7 PM ET- An Uber spokesperson says the incident in the video above was definitely caused by an error on the part of a human driver – full statement:
This incident was due to human error. This is why we believe so much in making the roads safer by building self-driving Ubers. This vehicle was not part of the pilot and was not carrying customers. The driver involved has been suspended while we continue to investigate.

Uber is aware of the incident depicted in the video above, which appears to show one of its self-driving test SUVs running a red light in San Francisco, where it launched a live pilot of the cars in service early on Wednesday; the company tells TechCrunch it is investigating what exactly occurred. The video, published by the San Francisco Examiner, was captured by a dashcam mounted inside a vehicle operated by Luxor Cab, one of SF’s licensed cab companies.
When contacted and asked for more information about the incident caught on the taxi’s camera, an Uber spokesperson provided the following statement:
Safety is our top priority. This incident has been reported and we are looking into what happened.
Uber’s self-driving test vehicles in San Francisco have a human driver behind the wheel, as well as a co-pilot technician in the front passenger seat taking measurements and observing data about the rides. The human driver is there to take control of the vehicle in case of any incidents, including ones like this, in theory, where a vehicle might fail to come to a complete stop at an intersection.
It’s also possible the human driver was in control of the vehicle at the time of the incident in the video, which would obviously present its own set of problems. Early on in the company’s Pittsburgh trials, reports emerged of incidents with the Ford Fusion self-driving test vehicles it’s using in that city, including wrong-way driving.
That the cars are not able to fully drive themselves is part of the reason Uber has argued that it does not need to seek from the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles a permit to test its vehicles on California roads (a position which the DMV contests).
We’ve asked Uber to update us if they discover more about the conditions surrounding the incident in the video and will update when and if that becomes available.

692,Uber’s San Francisco self-driving pilot draws criticism from California DMV,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/14/ubers-san-francisco-self-driving-pilot-draws-criticism-from-california-dmv/,2016/12/14,"
Uber launched a small fleet of self-driving vehicles in San Francisco on Tuesday, but the second city to host the public test of the ride-hailing company’s work in this area isn’t quite as enthusiastic on the regulator side. California’s DMV, which has a practice of vetting companies testing autonomous driving technology on state roads and then granting permits to those who meet its standards.
Twenty such companies are on the DMV’s list of parties approved for autonomous testing in the state, but Uber is not on that list – the DMV says it should be, but Uber maintains it doesn’t need to seek a permit because of the circumstances of its self-driving launch.
The DMV’s statement on the matter notes that while it “encourages the responsible exploration of self-driving cars,” it’s not enough to simply assume responsible action on the part of companies doing testing:
We have a permitting process in place to ensure public safety as this technology is being tested. Twenty manufacturers have already obtained permits to test hundreds of cars on California roads. Uber shall do the same.
Uber, for its part, maintains that it actually doesn’t require one of these special DMV permits in California because of the nature of its testing. That’s because it sees the vehicles as still primarily human-controlled, since a driver behind the wheel with their hands at the steering wheel ready to take control is still required at this phase of testing.
Uber confirmed to TechCrunch that it will not be pursuing a DMV permit at this time, and highlighted the following official comments taken from a blog post by Anthony Levandowski, head of its Advanced Technology Group:

Finally, we understand that there is a debate over whether or not we need a testing permit to launch self-driving Ubers in San Francisco. We have looked at this issue carefully and we don’t believe we do. Before you roll your eyes and think, “there they go again” let us take a moment to explain:
First, we are not planning to operate any differently than in Pittsburgh, where our pilot has been running successfully for several months. Second, the rules apply to cars that can drive without someone controlling or monitoring them. For us, it’s still early days and our cars are not yet ready to drive without a person monitoring them.
But there is a more fundamental point—how and when companies should be able to engineer and operate self-driving technology. We have seen different approaches to this question. Most states see the potential benefits, especially when it comes to road safety. And several cities and states have recognized that complex rules and requirements could have the unintended consequence of slowing innovation. Pittsburgh, Arizona, Nevada and Florida in particular have been leaders in this way, and by doing so have made clear that they are pro technology. Our hope is that California, our home state and a leader in much of the world’s dynamism, will take a similar view.

Uber is no stranger to disagreeing with local regulators in the course of its operations, and it has largely been successful in the U.S. and abroad in negotiating around rules where necessary. Whether that will be the case in this instance, too, remains to be seen.

694,The 2017 Mazda3 in the middle,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/13/the-2017-mazda3-in-the-middle/,2016/12/13,"
The 2017 Mazda3 provides more evidence of advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS) technology trickling down to more affordable cars. Between the luxury of the 2017 Volvo S90 and the Spartan appeal of the 2017 Toyota Yaris lies the Mazda3 in the middle ground.
In order to get all of the ADAS goodness, you have to begin with the Grand Touring trim level, which starts at $24,195. Then you have to add the Premium package, which adds LED headlights that turn on and off automatically, a navigation system, and a not unwelcome heated steering wheel for $1,600. Then you can add the i-ACTIVSENSE package, where you find all of the ADAS tech, for $1,100. This all added up to $27,930 for the test car, including the delivery fee.
The systems in the Mazda3 Grand Touring with all the extra options worked as well as they do in more expensive vehicles. The automatic emergency braking, which Mazda calls Smart City Brake Support, scrubs about 20 mph from your speed. At speeds below 20 mph, it will bring the car all the way to a stop. Radar cruise control helped at highway speeds and in stop-and-go traffic, which is just as important for relieving some of the driver’s cognitive load. The safety suite also included lane keeping assist and traffic sign recognition.
The Mazda3 has a little fold-away HUD screen on top of the dashboard called the Active Driving Display. I liked it better than I expected to; Mazda says it’s improved the crispness of the display, and it seemed very readable to me.
Unlike the 2017 Toyota Yaris, which has the basic ADAS features for under $17,000, the base-level Mazda3 sport, which starts at a comparable $17,845, doesn’t have any ADAS stuff. You can’t even add it as an option. So tech isn’t trickling down that far for every manufacturer quite yet.
The Mazda3 doesn’t have parallel parking assist or anything like autonomous driving capabilities. But it does pack a lot of tech into a mid-priced four-door sedan that gets 30 mpg according to the EPA rating, even with the respectable 184 hp coming from the 4-cylinder engine. And — don’t forget — a heated steering wheel.

Udacity is positioned perfectly to benefit from the rush on talent in a number of growing areas of interest among tech companies and startups. The online education platform has added 14 new hiring partners across its Artificial Intelligence Engineer, Self-Driving Car Engineer and Virtual Reality Developer Nanodegree programs, as well as in its Predictive Analytics Nanodegree, including standouts like Bosch, Harma, Slack, Intel, Amazon Alexa and Samsung.
That brings the total number of hiring partners for Udacity to over 30, which means a lot of potential soft landings for graduates of its nanodegree programs. The nanodegree offered by Udacity is its own original form of accreditation, which is based on a truncated field of study that spans months, rather than years, and allows students to direct the pace of their own learning. It also all takes place online, so students can potentially learn from anywhere.
For Udacity, hiring partners help prove the value of their program to potential students, as they’re effectively votes of confidence made by exactly the kinds of companies where students are looking to get jobs. For its hiring partners, Udacity’s program is a new funnel for talent, which is in short supply, especially in the areas where Udacity tends to offer nanodegrees, as their creation is driven by market demand. Sourcing top talent in these fields from traditional institutions like colleges and universities is incredibly competitive, expensive and potentially impossible, given the intense interest from almost all tech companies, big and small.
Here’s the full list of Udacity’s new partners, as organized by program:

Self-Driving Car Nanodegree – Bosch, HARMAN, Dataspeed, Auro Robotics and CrowdAI
AI Nanodegree – Amazon Alexa, Intel, Slack and Mobvoi
Virtual Reality Nanodegree – Samsung, Lucid VR, Nod, Upload
Predictive Analytics Nanodegree – Telefonica Germany

The company’s first three customers are based in California, and all took delivery in the Bay area.

Chevrolet had said that it would be delivering the Bolt by the end of 2016, and it made good on that promise by putting these first cars in the hands of customers now in December. The car’s sticker price is $37,495, which lets it just squeak under the $30,000 barrier (when considering green tax credits) that it and other EV makers like Tesla are trying to hit in order to break the affordable cost barrier for the average consumer.
The Bolt also offers 238 miles of EPA-estimated range, which is more than the 215 miles claimed by Tesla for the upcoming Model 3, with which it will compete directly.

The U.S. Department of Transportation wants all future cars in the U.S. to be able to talk to each other, with the aim of helping to prevent “hundreds of thousands” of accidents per year. The proposed rule would require that all new “light duty vehicles,” a category that includes your average consumer car, to have vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication tech built-in.
The V2V requirement would further the DOT’s current goal of pushing V2V advances wherever possible. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was erected to begin making rules around V2V back in December of 2014 as part of this effort. The rule proposed today as a result of those efforts would also require that V2V devices share a common language around established standards so that they work across automakers and other industry partners.
The DOT notes that proposed vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) guidance will be forthcoming soon from the Federal Highway Administration, which will detail how cars should talk to infra, including traffic lights and more.
DOT’s proposed rule includes specifics around the types of broadcast vehicles would make to one another, including a frequency of up to 10 times per second, using short-range communications frequencies. These signals would help inform automated driving and driver-assist functions, including autonomous emergency braking and adaptive cruise.


I'm sure it's all safe and secure, so no worries here! https://t.co/4bvBkh01b6

Of course, requiring that cars be able to communicate with each other using common standards poses a tremendous potential security risk, even as it has the potential to prevent accidents. The DOT notes that implementation would “require extensive privacy and security controls in any V2V devices,” but as security expert Charlie Miller suggests above, saying something must be so and actually implementing it in a way that’s genuinely secure is a very different story.

699,Velodyne’s latest solid-state LiDAR design keeps costs low for production at scale,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/13/velodynes-latest-solid-state-lidar-design-keeps-costs-low-for-production-at-scale/,2016/12/13,"
Velodyne has a new LiDAR sensor design that could help bring an autonomous-driving future closer than ever; it’s a small, solid-sate design that has a cost of less than $50 per system (when purchased at the kind of high-volume rates needed for mass manufacturing). LiDAR’s cost has been a limiting factor in seeing it applied more broadly as part of semi-autonomous driver assistance systems and fully autonomous cars targeting future production.
Solid-state construction also has big benefits here, because it means the component contains fewer moving parts, and therefore fewer potential opportunities for failure. Using solid-state design also means that the component can be smaller, and more cost-effective, all of which have been key choke points preventing LiDAR integration into systems designed for use in affordable, mass-market vehicles.
LiDAR is a key ingredient in autonomous driving because of how accurately it can measure distance between a vehicle and the physical world around it, including objects at rest and those in motion, like pedestrians. The accuracy of LiDAR’s measurements means it can pinpoint distance with the kind of accuracy not possible via other sensor systems, like standard optical cameras and radar. Some working on autonomous systems have been working around LiDAR, filling in the gaps with various alternative, more cost-effective methods, but ultimately a system that incorporates LiDAR with other sensors will probably be best-equipped to tackling full self-driving.
This new design isn’t here quite yet, however; it’s in testing at the moment, and “will be integrated into future products,” according to Velodyne. We’ll find out more about when it’ll be made available to OEMs in 2017, the company says.

700,Google has reportedly stopped developing its own self-driving car,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/12/google-has-reportedly-stopped-developing-its-own-self-driving-car/,2016/12/12,"
Google has reportedly shelved its long-standing plan to develop its own autonomous vehicle in favor of pursuing partnerships with existing car makers.
The Information reports that Google’s self-driving car unit — known internally as Chauffeur — is working with established automotive names to develop cars that will include some self-driving features, but won’t ditch the steering wheel and pedal controls. The firm is already working with Fiat Chrysler, per a partnership announced in May, and that could be the start of others to come.
Google first set out to do away with the steering wheel and pedals approach, but this backtrack is from Alphabet CEO Larry Page and CFO Ruth Porat, who found the original approach to be “impractical,” according to the report. That’s despite Google’s autonomous vehicles clocking over two million miles of tests on public roads.
While Google may be taking its foot off the gas for self-driving vehicles, The Information’s sources suggest it still harbors ambitious plans and is working to introduce an autonomous taxi service before the end of 2017. Google has long been rumored to move into the on-demand car space — it offers carpooling via its Waze business — and this would bring it into direct competition with Uber. Uber began trialing self-driving taxis in Pittsburgh this year, while another, younger company, Nutonomy, is conducting similar tests in Singapore and Boston, so Google is very much playing catch-up here.
The company is hosting a media event around its self-driving car business in California on Tuesday, so we’ll have more details soon.

Henrik Fisker’s newest electric car company, Fisker Inc., continues the gradual reveal of its first car, the EMotion. I certainly have a lot of feelings looking at this — feelings like skepticism that this vehicle will ever make it to production. But Fisker Inc. maintains that it will, and that once it does, it’ll have a 161 MPH top speed with 400 miles of range from its on-board electric powerhouse.
Fisker Inc. previously showed us some images of the car’s profile and front (embedded below), and now it’s ready to reveal the back. The back of the car features “wide sculptural shoulders, thin light blue tail lights, wide trunk opening, and aggressive lower rear diffuser to improve aero,” according to the company.

Also new in this image is the shiny metallic paint job, which is a contrast from the matte appearance of the previously released renders. You can also see the back of the color contrast roof, which will likely be a full-length panorama-style sunroof, and the gadget, which looks just like the badge from the original Fisker, whose assets were purchased by a Chinese company and relaunched as Karma Automotive.
Fisker Inc. says we’ll hear more about the vehicle and its plans in 2017, but we’ll still have to wait until at least the middle of next year to get a better idea of when exactly these things might start to ship.

702,"UberPOOL streamlines matchmaking, pickups and driver-side features",https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/12/uberpool-streamlines-matchmaking-pickups-and-driver-side-features/,2016/12/12,"
Uber is making some changes to how uberPOOL operates under the hood, which are designed to make connecting the dots between riders and drivers easier for a more streamlined experience overall. The changes are mostly hidden from the rider, as they involve back-end upgrades in routing and matchmaking, as well as driver-oriented fixes to make it easier to manage driving POOL, but the end result should be improvements in key areas for the service.
I spoke to uberPOOL product managers Brian Tolkin and Nan Ransohoff about the new updates, which include improved matchmaking that continually tries to connect the best-positioned drivers with the optimal riders, even after a ride match is made. Both said that while uberPOOL has already been a service welcomed by its users, people also continually identified a few common frustrations that could be addressed via product improvements.
UberPOOL origins

Tolkin noted that uberPOOL’s origins began a little over two years ago when it saw that across its hundreds of thousands of trips in any given city where it operates, many riders were going between the same places at the same time. While carpooling had emerged as a fad in the 1970s and 1980s, it actually has been in general decline as a trend since, the messiness of having to make these arrangements yourself among a group of individuals you organize being a big contributor. Uber had the means to address these roadblocks, and the trip data to optimize groups of riders based on common origin and destination, not shared friend groups, office co-occupancy or other social shared circumstances.
“We looked at our ecosystem, and we said[…] we might be able to reverse that trend and say we can put carpooling back on the rise, we can help people get around their city more efficiently,” Tolkin told me. “At the time it was a pretty big bet. We didn’t know how it would work, we didn’t know fundamentally if people would be down to share the car with someone else, we didn’t know if they’d be cool with going a little bit out of their way, and we certainly didn’t know if the economics would work.”
Tolkin says that luckily the answer to all those questions has proven “a resounding ‘yes’ ” over the past two years, but that they’ve also “learned a lot about what will make this product tick,” which is why they’ve been working on these changes.
Matchmaking magic
The first of these is improved matchmaking, which includes automatic trip upgrades and predictive matching. Automatic trip upgrades simply means that if Uber’s system spots a better pairing of driver and rider, even after an initial match has already been made, it’ll immediately make the change and alert both rider and driver via push notification to make sure they’re kept in the loop.
“The amount of times we can match two people, and the quality of those matches allows us to keep prices low and also save time for riders,” explained Ransohoff, saying that this motivated the development of tech that constantly seeks to optimize uberPOOL rides to find that line-of-best-fit, where the driver is picking up the people along their route that make the most sense, even as new riders hail POOL and other drivers come online with other, more appropriate routes.
Basically, it works as depicted in my amazing artist rendering below:

In addition to these background upgrades, Uber has also enabled predictive matching for POOL, which basically looks at historical data and makes an educated guess about future requests from riders along a given route. That means that if Uber’s system thinks it will have a better match in the near future, Ransohoff explained, it’ll temporarily wait on matching you with current riders that are less optimal in terms of giving you the most direct route possible.
Prompting punctuality
To help make sure that picking up other riders adds as little extra time to uberPOOL trips as possible, the company is also adding two new features related to shortening pickup times, including status notifications for riders and a new countdown timer for drivers. The rider notices include gentle prods like “be ready outside,” “meet your driver now,” as well as a “leaving shortly” alert for when more urgent speed is required immediately before a ride is cleared to leave.

On the driver side, the app now shows a countdown timer that begins at two minutes once a driver reaches the designated pickup point. The idea is that drivers don’t have to manage keeping track on their own, and know exactly when they’re cleared to move on to the next destination, while also being able to collect a no-show fee per Uber’s policy with late riders.
“This might seem like a small change, but ultimately every second counts for our riders and drivers,” Ransohoff said. “So we’re hoping that this is kind of cultivating this idea of […] be respectful to your fellow co-riders, be respectful to your drivers.”
Easing driver workload
Finally, on the driver end, there’s also a couple of updates that are intended to improve navigation and nix the math required in tracking how much drivers are actually making from any given trip.
“How do we make POOL easier, as effortless and easy for them to drive, because it is a harder product to drive than X,” Ransohoff offered, explaining why they’ve focused on these specific areas on the driver’s side.
Route extension provides a longer visual lead on what’s coming up for the driver beyond the next pickup or drop off, letting them know in advance when they need to make a turn, or what lane they should be in currently. This is a bit like having additional directions on your GPS app of choice about upcoming steps in the trip, and Ransohoff says it should just help take one more potential concern or stress off the driver’s plate.
A very different new driver app feature has a very similar goal; uberPOOL trips previously broke out individual legs of a trip as separate rides in a driver pay statement, but now the entire trip will be aggregated as a single line item, taking into account the whole trip time, distance covered and any surge bonuses, and providing a final tally of what the driver earned from the entire POOL ride. It means less back-of-the-envelope addition for drivers, and hopefully provides them a better sense of how POOL works for them as a revenue generator.
Tolkin says that POOL is a key ingredient in Uber’s overarching mission to make transportation as accessible and reliable as running water, with an eye toward serving the part of the market for whom even an uberX every day is not an affordable option. With that in mind, it’s going to continue to seek to optimize the experience so that supply and demand match up as perfectly as possible in terms of both routing and matches, so expect more improvements to come.

703,Blackmore raises $3.5 million to build better eyes for your self-driving car,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/12/blackmore-raises-3-5-million-to-build-better-eyes-for-your-self-driving-car/,2016/12/12,"
A Bozeman, Montana startup called Blackmore Sensors and Analytics Inc. has raised $3.5 million to build lidar systems that can help vehicles see more details about what’s in front of them than existing sensors do today.
The company spun out of a research and development firm called Bridger Photonics that developed lidar systems for micron-precise laser cutting and welding, originally, and then for military surveillance.
Generally lidar systems “see” by emitting beams of light every nanosecond. When the light bounces back, based on how long it takes to return, lidar determines how far away an object is.
Blackmore’s lidar systems are distinct from others on the market because they employ what’s known as frequency modulation, rather than amplitude modulation. So the light beams that Blackmore’s systems transmit will vary in color. When those colored light beams bounce back off a person, object or structure, they give Blackmore’s lidar system enough data to understand not just how far away a thing is, and how big it is, but also how it is moving.
Blackmore President and co-founder Randy Reibel said, “Because we simultaneously get range to target, and how fast a target is moving, we can get a lot of information without having to do a lot of extra computation. This is important for autonomous vehicles because you can quickly tell if there’s someone walking with a velocity signature that is normal, or slow, in a crosswalk. Or you can tell if there’s a person riding a bicycle.”
Reibel said the company’s existing lidar system is about the size of a soda can. The company will use its funding, in part, to create new systems that are miniaturized, and won’t require mechanical parts within, namely rotating mirrors to move beams of light around.
Next Frontier Capital led the Series A investment in Blackmore, joined by Millennium Technology Value Partners.
According to Next Frontier General Partner Richard Harjes, his firm sees Blackmore as “seriously ahead on the tech” that could make self-driving cars safe and a mainstream reality sooner rather than later.
The investor said he expects the company to use its funding for ongoing research and development, but also to strike strategic relationships in 2017 with original equipment manufacturers, startups working on autonomous vehicles and tier 1 suppliers to the automotive industry.
“We already have a working system, now we need to get it dialed in on a vehicle,” Harjes said.
One reason his firm backed Blackmore, the investor noted, was because of its dual-pronged approach to the market: “Blackmore has a serious lead using lidar for security applications given its defense background and this strength will drive the non-automotive aspect of the firm. This sets Blackmore apart from most others.”
The startup, which employs 22 full-time today, competes with well-funded lidar makers like Quanergy and Velodyne.

704,Mojio raises another $7 million for its connected car platform,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/12/mojio-raises-another-7-million-for-its-connected-car-platform/,2016/12/12,"
Vancouver, Canada-based Mojio started out as a connected car gadget and platform that wasn’t unlike Automatic and similar services. In 2015, however, Mojio started emphasizing the B2B2C market and its platform play over its earlier B2C focus.
In the process, the company’s founder and CEO Jay Giraud quietly stepped down last October, though he already laid much of the groundwork for this change, and Mojio brought in Kenny Hawk as its new CEO. Giraud is now an entrepreneur in residence at Yamaha Motor Ventures & Laboratory Silicon Valley.
Back in 2015, Mojio (still under Giraud at the time) announced that it had raised an $8 million Series A round from Deutsche Telekom, Relay Ventures, Canada’s government-funded venture arm BDC, AOL co-founder Steve Case and others. It kept that round open, though, and today the company announced that it has raised an additional $7 million. Most of the new funding comes from existing investors, with BC Tech Fund via Kensington Capital being the only new investor. Mojio tells me that it kept the round open to ensure that it “had the runway to go global and the resources to grow [its] engineering talent.”
I briefly spoke to Giraud after today’s announcement. “We were very strict about carrying the cost burden of being a cellular-based device from the start, because we designed the business model to be at the intersection of the wireless carriers and the automotive OEM’s who I predicted would battle for control of the connected car,” he told me. “Our model intentionally aligned with wireless carriers so we could one day have them add Mojio’s to people’s cell phone plans and scale beyond any pure B2C angle.”
The addition of Deutsche Telekom is no coincidence then. The company is also specifically targeting wireless operators as partners and T-Mobile has already signed up in the United States. Given the continued involvement of Deutsche Telekom (and the fact that Mojio tells me it is building a team in Prague), I expect we’ll soon see more partnerships in Europe, too. Mojio was one of the first connected car gadgets to include always-on wireless connections that didn’t rely on using a cell phone in the car to connect to the wider internet, so this focus on carriers makes sense for the company, especially given that it already had a number of existing partnerships before its pivot.

Similarly, Mojio wants to use Alexa to give its platform access to Amazon’s larger personal assistant platform. “With this investment, the Alexa Fund is helping fuel the development of Mojio’s second generation Alexa Skill, which will harness the vast amount of automotive data being collected by Mojio’s open platform and bring new capabilities to Alexa,” Mojio writes in today’s announcement.  It’s easy to imagine a scenario where you could ask Alexa “How much fuel does my car have?” and have the service query Mojio’s platform for the answer.
For now, Mojio continues to focus on bringing its service to cars that aren’t already connected in some form or another. While that’s probably still a sizable market today, it will inevitably shrink over time. Going forward, Mojio will also have to build partnerships with car manufacturers directly, which could be a tough sell, because the likes of Ford, VW and others are also quickly becoming software companies and will likely not want to rely on a third-party platform for their own cars.

Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Vinod Khosla, Jack Ma, John Doerr and 15 other high-profile investors have formed a new venture firm, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, that will pour at least $1 billion into cleantech companies over the next 20 years.
The firm’s goal, according to its own website, will be: “to provide everyone in the world with access to reliable, affordable power, food, goods, transportation, and services without contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.”
BEV will invest in tech ventures at any stage, from seed through commercialization. The deals will focus on electricity, manufacturing, agriculture, buildings and transportation.
Cleantech was once the rage in Silicon Valley, with total venture capital dollars invested in clean tech hitting $6.1 billion in 2008 before the recession. But cleantech became a dirty word following the cratering of startups that had taken venture capital, as well as significant amounts of government loans, grants, subsidies or tax credits.
Along with scores of others that shut down, failing to save the planet or to realize meaningful returns for investors, were: solar panel makers Solyndra; Aptera, which attempted to make highly fuel-efficient cars; and waste-to-fuel company Kior. (Remember them?)
But a burgeoning world population, and energy needs growing along with it, are driving up demand for technology that can help people produce more of what they need with fewer resources. So cleantech is drawing investments and being discussed again, favorably, even if some VC’s avoid labeling their portfolio companies as such.
BEV is the formal, venture investing initiative of the Breakthrough Energy Coalition, a group announced at the 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference.
The group, comprised of tech and finance all-stars, pledged to invest in early-stage startups in nations that were ramping up their public, R&D funding for cleantech, to reach a collective $30 billion by 2020.
Besides making its venture fund known, BEV published a framework today called the “Landscape of Innovation,” which it intends to be “a guide to other public and private investors committed to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.”

706,New Michigan law prepares for autonomous future,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/09/new-michigan-law-prepares-for-autonomous-future/,2016/12/09,"
Michigan Governor Rick Snyder visited the Automotive Hall of Fame in Dearborn, MI, which honors the automotive past, to sign a bill that aims to enable the automotive future. The law creates regulations for testing, using and selling autonomous vehicles in the state and clarifies how these vehicles will be used on public roads.
The law specifically allows vehicles that have no human controls — no steering wheel, no pedals — to be tested in Michigan. It makes clear that both automotive companies and tech companies are able to operate self-driving ridesharing vehicles. This is no surprise, given that FCA, Ford, GM, Toyota, Google, Uber and Lyft were all partners in creating this legislation. And it allows the sale of autonomous vehicles to the public once the technology has been tested and certified.
The law cedes that testing and certification to NHTSA, according to an email from the Michigan Department of Transportation. “The traditional role has been for equipment standards to be determined and tested at the national level. That seems likely to be the same for autonomous technology.”
While this does allow for the sale of certified self-driving vehicles, there are no provisions in place yet for educating the driving public or the dealerships on the safe use of these future cars. “The news accounts of the Tesla incidents have certainly impressed upon the general public and those in the industry that there is an important need to be familiar with the vehicle characteristics,” the email stated. “The Michigan legislation does not proscribe a specific manner of addressing user familiarity with the technology, but key state agencies are ready to assist the private developers of the technology in this regard.”
The law also creates the Michigan Council on Future Mobility, which will be part of MDOT. This new entity will regulate connected-vehicle networks as they arise and keep tabs on the use of traffic data generated by these networks, such as crash information.

The California Department of Motor Vehicles posts a list of all the companies and entities cleared to test self-driving vehicles on public roads in the state, and that list has a new member: Nvidia. The graphics card-maker also builds processing units for use in autonomous driving systems, including those capable of deep learning.
Nvidia is working with a number of companies on the list as a supplier of processing power for self-driving, including Tesla and Delphi, but it’s also building its own test vehicles to help prove and improve its own systems.

You can see one of these cars in the video above, nicknamed BB8 and trained in California. This new license suggests it’ll get more training opportunities now, in real traffic conditions on real city streets.
Nvidia is doing this testing solo, with the aim of building its own contained, intelligent learning autonomous driving system — which it could presumably then add to the list of things it can supply to automakers looking for ready-to-drive systems from top-tier suppliers in the future, as an alternative to having to develop their own.

708,Tread connects car enthusiasts via plate numbers,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/07/tread-connects-car-nuts-via-plate-numbers/,2016/12/07,"
It is not uncommon in the automotive enthusiast community to admire another’s ride. The best most people could do was give a thumbs-up as they passed or leave a note on a parked car’s windshield. But no more; this is 2016. Today Tread launches, an app that connects enthusiasts using their license plate numbers.
There are many questions a person might have about the wisdom of an app like this. First of all, are drivers expected to use it while they’re driving? “We don’t want anybody texting while they’re driving,” said CEO and founder Jason Bosnak. “It’s not our intention for users to talk about a driver right in front of them.” He suggests letting a passenger, if you’ve got one in the car with you, use the app. Or remember the license plate number and message them via Tread when you’re parked. Or use a dash cam to capture the number for later.
The press materials for the app said that users could message other users to challenge them to a race, which Bosnak admitted was poor wording. “You could find someone who has a car that’s similar to your car and ask about parts and problems, ask if they race,” he said. “It’s not necessarily a race-off in the streets. We’re not promoting people break laws everywhere.”
Tread is promoting that enthusiasts can communicate with each other via this app rather than using forums or Facebook pages devoted to one make or even one single model. “It’s a segmented community,” Bosnak said. If you’re into cars, even if you’re really into your car, you’re probably also into other cars. Tread is aiming to connect people like you to share events, cool cars on the street and virtual garages.
Over the past year, Bosnak has worked to make a simple app to use on the go and a website with features like the virtual garage and connections to Facebook and Twitter. The app — which is available for iOS now and Android within a month or two — will always be free to users, but Bosnak hopes to use targeted ads. “We could pair up advertisers with the cars you drive or are interested in,” he said. For example, if you post on Tread about needing new front brake discs, the app could show you when those discs are on sale at the AutoZone a mile from your house.
The last concern is privacy, and it’s a concern for Bosnak too. “It’s very important, and we’ve spent a considerable amount of time thinking about it,” he said. He’s spoken with lawyers regarding the reasonable expectation of privacy; a car parked on the street is fair game, but a car parked in someone’s driveway is not. “We want to protect people so information isn’t disclosed,” Bosnak said. “It’s something the internet is challenged with.” Members have complete control over their vehicles on the site and can remove any post they don’t like. “I’m sure we’ll continue to learn how to better control our network. We want it to be enjoyable and safe for everyone to use.”

709,AeroVironment: official charger of the Chevy Bolt,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/06/aerovironment-official-charger-of-the-chevy-bolt/,2016/12/06,"
The 2017 Chevy Bolt is coming to California and Oregon before the end of 2016, and along with it comes its very own official charger from AeroVironment.
The company’s EVSE-RS charger has been available for some time, and AeroVironment is not new to the EV charging game. The company is kind of an unofficial charger for everyone else; it sells models compatible with just about every EV on the market — Ford, Fiat, BMW, Nissan, Toyota even Tesla. And though it’s available through dealerships that sell the Bolt, the AeroVironment charger doesn’t come with the car like a prize in a Cracker Jack box. It’s an official accessory that buyers will have to purchase. The retail price for the 30-amp 240-volt charger is about $1,000.
It is a Level 2 charger, which means it will charge your Bolt (or any EV) five times faster than plugging the car into a regular household outlet, which is known in the EV universe as Level 1 charging. The EVSE-RS is rated to be used indoors or out, so if you don’t have room inside the garage to park your car, it can be installed elsewhere so you can charge in the driveway.
No other electric vehicle on the market right now has an official charger. Tesla does have the Wall Connector home charger that is designed to work with its cars, but both the car and charger are made by a single company. Other companies like ChargePoint, GE, Siemens and JuiceBox all make home EV chargers that you can buy on Amazon. So it may be easier to buy an AeroVironment charger at the dealership when you buy your Bolt, but it’s not absolutely required.

Aftermarket heads-up driving accessory maker Navdy is teaming up with Harman, one of the leading suppliers of connected car systems and other components for automobiles. Harman, recently acquired by Samsung, has made a strategic investment in Navdy, and will also co-brand a new “Navdy with Harman” aftermarket HUD device that will be sold both directly to OEM automotive companies, as well as to consumers in North America starting in January.
The team-up is a clutch partnership for Navdy, which began shipping its first product this fall after a successful funding campaign that accumulated over $2.4 million in pre-orders from customers. The Navdy HUD allows anyone to add a heads-up display to their vehicle, which can project information directly onto a car’s windshield from a connected smartphone.
Navdy’s own product costs $799, which is fairly steep given other competitors selling similar devices via Amazon. Navdy’s software is more custom-designed, however, including hands-free gesture control, and its hardware is also designed to work in all lighting conditions. HUDs are a relatively common feature on new vehicles, but older cars looking to retrofit are a big and growing market, according to an IHS market survey cited by Navdy and Harman, which is part of the reason for Harman’s interest in this new tie-up.

Harman should provide Navdy with a lot more reach in terms of distribution, and the companies also note there will be some crossover bundle deals with Harman auto and audio accessory brand JBL. The Navdy ingredient also gives Harman a new category to add to its existing range of infotainment-related devices, in a field that could potentially become big business in an era where other early aftermarket standouts like Bluetooth add-on kits are becoming less relevant as cars without them installed as factory standard options are aging out of the market.
Harman’s recent purchase by Samsung in a deal worth $8 billion is a great indicator of how much interest there is in staking out real estate in the car market by tech companies. Aftermarket is a significant portion of this potential next focal area for tech, especially for capturing additional revenue opportunity now, rather than a few years down the road, and that’s good news for startups pushing the space forward like Navdy.

Ride-hailing requires a lot of machine smarts to maintain a competitive edge, so it’s not surprising to see Uber make a strategic acquisition in the artificial intelligence space. The company has acquired Geometric Intelligence, a startup co-founded by academic researchers with AI experience, and its team will provide the core for a new central AI lab being established at Uber’s SF HQ.
Uber’s doing a lot with machine learning already through its research team in Pittsburgh, but they’re focused specifically on solving issues related to autonomous driving. This new core team will be looking at applications for AI more broadly, with a focus on basic research that’s likely to have impact across a range of potential uses, including things like route management. It’s also yet another sign that Uber wants to be passed among tech bigs like Google, Apple and Microsoft whose interests range beyond a single domain.
Geometric Intelligence’s funding team includes NYU cognitive scientist Gary Marcus, Cambridge machine learning prof Zoubin Ghahramani, University of Central Florida comp science prof Kenneth Stanley and NYU PhD in neurolinguistics Douglas Bemis. Its staff of 15 include a number of high-profile data science and artificial intelligence academics, and all will retain their professional associations with their academic institutions as part of the deal.
The focus of GI’s research to date has been on solving the problem of how to make AI systems and agents that can do object or scenario recognition using far smaller sets of data than are normally required. We’ve done a lot to advance the AI requirement for processing power for sifting through massive data sets, but Uber’s new team was looking at the other side of the problem; making systems smarter with limited input. That could be a huge help in quickly helping ramp the effectiveness of products at Uber that don’t necessarily have an equivalent data set to draw upon.
Uber Chief Product Officer Jeff Holden noted in a blog post that regardless of which aspect of the company’s business you look at, there’s a common challenge found in “negotiating the real world” that represents a “high-order intelligence problem.” Building out capacity in basic research is almost certainly the most effective way to solve this problem across verticals.

713,Apple reveals autonomous vehicle ambitions in letter to US regulators,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/03/apple-reveals-autonomous-vehicle-ambitions-in-letter-to-us-regulators/,2016/12/03,"
Apple has publicly revealed its ambitions to play in the emerging market of self-driving vehicles with a policy recommendation letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
Wall Street Journal first broke news of the communique.
Precise details of Apple automotive products were not revealed in the letter. But it did state that:
“Apple uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive, and more personal. The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.”
Written by Apple Director of Product Integrity Steve Kenner, the letter calls for policies that will bring about: a clear understanding of who is liable for problems that occur when cars drive themselves; the maintenance of users’ privacy, cybersecurity and physical safety; and ensuring that the impact of self-driving cars on the public is as positive as can be.
The impact of any new regulation on a burgeoning industry could be chilling or make room for new brands, jobs and technological breakthroughs, of course.
Apple strongly calls for policies that treat newcomers in the automotive industry the same as incumbent leaders. A new automaker should not have to disclose more information about their autonomous vehicles, the letter suggests, before they test them on public roads in a safe and controlled manner.
This recommendation has the internet abuzz with the idea that Apple will make its own brand of self-driving cars, after all, not just the software or operating systems within them.
The letter also admonishes NHTSA to form policies that will protect drivers’ individual privacy.
Kenner writes:

“Apple agrees that companies should share de-identified scenario and dynamics data from crashes and near-misses…By sharing data, the industry will build a more comprehensive dataset than any one company could create alone…






[But] Data sharing should not come at the cost of privacy. Apple believes that companies should invest the resources necessary to protect individuals’ fundamental right to privacy.”





Rumors of an Apple car have long been swirling online, and were renewed when the company reportedly enlisted Bob Mansfield to head its auto division. Mansfield was formerly the leader of engineering teams behind products like the MacBook Air and iPad.
Following his appointment though, the Cupertino tech juggernaut reorganized its teams to focus on developing the “brains” within an autonomous vehicle, reportedly.
If Apple stays true to its winning playbook of owning both the hardware and the software within to make its entrance in transportation, we will one day see a self-driving car in its name.

714,Spatial helps users navigate like a native,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/01/spatial-helps-users-navigate-like-a-native/,2016/12/01,"
Lyden Foust was an ethnographer traveling the world on behalf of corporations, living in a city for months at a time to learn what he could, and reporting back to the people who hired him. “I realized people were telling their social media more than they would ever tell me as a researcher,” Foust said. And so he partnered with his friend Will Kiessling, a jet engine software engineer used to dealing with vast amounts of data, to create Spatial.
Spatial pulls data from “tons and tons of social sources,” Foust said, then uses it in aggregate to help users understand the city like a local would. Spatial pulls from more than 30 sources, including Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, and Tinder, but also from apps like Strava to find out where people are riding their bikes and weather apps to learn what people do when it’s sunny or rainy or snowing. “If you look at one source, it’s totally junk ,” Foust said. “You can’t understand it . But looking at them in aggregate, you can ask what’s happening on Instagram when it’s raining.”
Foust noted that there are many apps that try to get people from point A to point B, from their car’s navigation system to websites like Yelp. “The market is endless,” he said. So rather than building yet another app, Spatial is an API that any app maker or automotive company can license for their own use. In 2016, Spatial participated in the Techstars Mobility Accelerator program, and on Demo Day, the company announced a deal with Ford.
“If you ask any of these apps, Where’s a Chinese restaurant?, that’s fine ,” Foust said. “But if you ask anything beyond that – conditional questions – you end up on Google for an hour.” Spatial pulls data from its dozens of sources to tell users which bars have sunset views over the water, or which neighborhoods have the best Christmas lights.
Spatial is based in Detroit, which Foust said “makes it really difficult to raise money for an app.” Thus the decision to provide the API and sell directly to businesses. It’s a strategy that seems to have worked — Ford is the 9-month-old company’s largest customer, and Spatial expects to close a $2 million round of seed funding next week.

715,Tesla will move to open Richmond store after DMV win,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/30/tesla-will-move-to-open-richmond-store-after-dmv-win/,2016/11/30,"
Tesla has won the right to open and operate its own dealership in Virginia, after the state Department of Motor Vehicles commissioner reversed a ruling from September denying it a license. In his decision, the commissioner cited overwhelming public support, as well as unique sales and service requirements as reasons for his finding that “no dealer independent of Tesla” in proposed store city Richmond is fit to do so correctly.
Tesla’s been fighting for the right to open and run dealerships for its vehicles across the U.S., in what has become a state-by-state battle fought in local courts and regulatory bodies. The Tesla win in Virginia is significant, but it isn’t a total green light; the carmaker still needs approval from the state’s Motor Vehicle Dealer Board — still, all indicators suggest it’s going to be able to open and operate the Richmond location soon.
While the state’s Automobile Dealers Association lobbied to prevent the license being granted, the commissioner noted in his ruling that even by their own admission they would not be able to make money on operating third-party Tesla dealerships given the carmaker’s sale model. The commissioner also cited Tesla’s leading customer satisfaction stores for the quality of its service centers as another reason for granting the license.
Another reason given for allowing the license is the distance prospective Virginia Tesla customers would have to travel to find a store, and then to service one post-purchase. The full text of the decision is embedded below.
A Tesla spokesperson provided the following statement to TechCrunch when contacted:

Tesla applauds the Commissioner’s decision to allow us to open our new store and service center in Richmond, Virginia.
This decision will allow Richmond-area consumers to learn about and purchase their Tesla vehicles in closer proximity to their homes. We are thankful for the many Tesla owners and Virginians for their support.
We intend to swiftly begin construction to open our new store and service center at 9850 West Broad Street and look forward to joining Richmond’s business community.

Tesla, a great family brand
As interest rates climb, explore insourcing




As any new industry takes shape, technical fragmentation occurs. The connected car is new and hot and, like markets prior, there’s a huge land-grab unfolding in front of all consumers. Up close, it feels very much like the early days of smartphones: Everyone was trying to be a player. All companies built their own flavor of software and, as a byproduct, all hardware (smartphones) was weak, at best. Apple and Google (Android) quickly began to standardize that market and, well, the rest was history.
With the connected car, much is the same. Everyone is competing for space in your garage with the promise of life-changing car and home connectivity. The connected car as part of the larger home is the Wild West of the IoT. The future is very exciting and promising.
Your car can now talk to the internet — but what is it supposed to do and say? Car manufacturers are trying to figure out what makes sense for the drivers and passengers. Much is still unknown.
Currently, most major car manufacturers have their own flavor of car connectivity; to stay competitive, they need to. In broad strokes, they all do the same thing. They have some early iteration of touchscreen technology that incorporates streaming music, onboard computer diagnostics and basic controls for the car (heated seats, A/C, etc.). The more advanced car manufacturers have some companion applications that can precondition the car, unlock the doors and show historical trip details for basic social collaboration. Again, still very early in the life cycle.
The most advanced, in this case, is Tesla. Tesla does all of the above and begins incorporating what the future will likely be for all cars. Tesla has proper onboard computer displays, interesting and more natural human input to controls and connectivity to the car, even when you’re not driving, through an immersed online community and companion app.
Even with Tesla leading the way, we’re falling behind where the future is going. With every car company building their own siloed systems, we are still in the dark days — as we saw years ago with early software operating systems and more recently with smartphones.
We need an “Android type” system for the connected car, home and potentially IoT.
Here’s the big problem — like industries prior, this fragmentation means devices won’t talk to one another in any streamlined way. We have no standardized open framework for car suppliers to build their hardware (cars) on top of and, thus, developers will not..ever…ever…ever…spend time thinking about how cars and drivers can work together in a unified way. This is currently the biggest missed opportunity for market maturity.
In the most simple terms, we need an “Android type” system for the connected car, home and potentially IoT. We need to standardize how cars, appliances and the larger home talk to one another. As we begin to standardize, we will see, as we have in the past with other industries, a streamlined approach to human and computer interaction and a limitless opportunity for new market growth.
For instance, there are multiple areas where the connected car is going to have huge impacts. The first will be how the car interfaces with your home. The car, based on location and driving habits, will alert the house that you’re coming home. It will analyze the current weather and precondition your house. It will turn the heat or A/C on, condition the lights based on time of day and potentially preheat the oven — preconditioning your home for your arrival.
The second will be how you as a driver interface with your car, other cars and the larger exterior elements. A connected framework like this will know based on driving habits where you’re going and will automatically calculate driving suggestions based on weather, traffic (Google does this) energy efficiency (especially as we move more to electric) and other, similar cars in your fleet.
A world where you know in real-time — based on exterior temperatures, wind, cars around you and driving habits — suggested speeds you should drive for desired outputs. Such outputs would be: most efficient, fastest to destination or least congested.
A social layer where you can naturally communicate with “smart notifications” would allow you to communicate with other cars in your proximity, and automatically incorporate social tools like Instagram and Spotify, where your pictures and songs simply appear “on your road trip” as you drive, inside your app and car screen, ready to be shared with the world. This type of system would also enable recommendations for when more complex systems like auto-drive should be turned on and off.
The good news however is, this future is not nearly as far off as it once was. Fortunately, a few powerhouse companies and funded startups are working on this and already have early iterations in the marketplace. There are a few different categories taking shape within the automotive software industry.
There are companies like Google and Apple that are focused on taking software from your phone and interfacing with the car’s existing console systems. This is a necessary but incremental step in the right direction to bridge the gap from car manufacturer to software company.
Similarly, there are startups, like TeslaTracks and EVDriving, that are taking more of the open, social model, where tracking is done from the phone or computer to the car with an app interface on a phone.

Finally, there’s a suite of tools, like Automatic, that plug directly into the port in your car and push out driving-related information — which is not new, but is starting to play more of a role as drivers become comfortable sharing their data (especially with insurance companies).
All of these types of companies are helping shape how the automotive world will interface with software. Imagining a framework that can ingest and model multiple feeds as Android did would enable this type of deep communication. We have the data, we even have the devices to transmit such information, but while we’re making positive headway, we don’t yet have the mature software to incorporate and thus push downstream to the car manufacturers and, finally, consumers.
Many teams are working on a solution, and a winner will soon be decided. The company that wins will unlock an incredible amount of revenue, because connectivity is going to be the new horsepower.

717,Lucid Motors will begin manufacturing in Arizona in 2017,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/29/lucid-motors-will-begin-manufacturing-in-arizona-in-2017/,2016/11/29,"
Lucid Motors, a new electric car company, announced at a press conference today that it would begin building its manufacturing center in Casa Grande, Arizona, in 2017. Parts and supplies for the facility will come from the state of Sonora in Mexico, which borders Arizona. The company’s headquarters will likely remain in San Francisco.
Arizona Governor Doug Ducey said that the company expects to bring 2,000 new jobs to Arizona and invest $700 million in the site by the year 2022. Brian Barron, Lucid Motors’ director of global manufacturing, said that Lucid will begin hiring for the production facility as early as next year. Barron noted that he himself is a Navy veteran and that Lucid has committed to training and hiring American military veterans for positions at the new facility.
During the parade of local elected officials and Lucid executives at the lectern, two of Lucid’s alpha prototypes rolled into the plaza in front of the Arizona state capitol building in Phoenix, where the event was held. The cars were wrapped in black-and-white graphic camouflage to disguise their exact designs, but the cars did drive out under their own quiet electric power (unlike Faraday Future’s much-hyped prototype).
Lucid CTO Peter Rawlinson noted that the cars will have 1,000 hp, which had been announced, and that a version with a 400-mile range will be available. Lucid had also previously said that the cars, which will be in production in 2018 according to Rawlinson, will have some autonomous capabilities.
Rawlinson also said in his remarks that Lucid used the opportunities in creating an electric vehicle from scratch to condense the drivetrain so that the sedan could be “reimagined and redesigned,” particularly regarding interior space. The prototypes that were shown today were fine examples of the sedan form, but they hardly broke any significant new ground in exterior design.
Given the resurgence in buyers’ interest in SUVs, it’s interesting that Lucid’s designers chose to work with a four-door sedan as their first vehicle. The most recent stats show that sales of SUVs and crossovers (which fall into the light trucks category) are all outselling cars as of October. This gap has been widening for at least a year, so it seems that any electric vehicle startup that can develop a zero-emissions small SUV or CUV to better compete with Tesla’s Model X would find a potential sweet spot in the market. That could still be Faraday Future, and it could even still be Lucid Motors.

718,Intel creates a dedicated autonomous driving technology group,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/29/intel-creates-a-dedicated-autonomous-driving-technology-group/,2016/11/29,"
Intel is following up on news early Tuesday about its partnership with Mobileye and Delphi on self-driving tech with more autonomous vehicle news: it’s creating a whole group dedicated to pursuit of self-driving solution development, called – you’ll never guess – the Automated Driving Group (ADG for short).
The new Intel ADG will be headed up by Intel vet Doug Davis, who previously led the IoT group and is putting off his retirement after 30 years with the chipmaker to act as SVP and strategic lead for the group. Reporting to Davis will be Kathy Winter, who comes to Intel from new partner Delphi and will act as VP and GM of the ADG, handling more of the day-to-day responsibilities of managing the team.
ADG’s formation is part of a larger management re-org at Intel, but the introduction of a dedicated vertical focused on autonomous driving is probably the most significant of the shifts overall. Intel recently announced that it’s making $250 million bet on self-driving tech via its Intel Capital investment arm, and Tuesday’s earlier announcement regarding its chip supply relationship with Mobileye and Delphi shows it has grand designs on the emerging space.
Intel also noted that it will be providing Intel Core i7 processors for use in the Delphi/Mobileye platform, which is making its official debut in a test vehicle at CES in January. The Core i7s being used are essentially placeholders, however – Intel will be shifting the platform to a new, unnamed and more powerful processor the chipmaker is going to officially reveal sometime in the next few weeks (CES seems like a good bet for this, too).
Autonomous driving is only part of the ADG’s mandate; it’ll also focus on driver assist technologies, meaning it’ll continue the work that Intel is currently doing with a long list of automaker clients using its chips, including BMW, Daimler, Hyundai, Toyota, Tesla and more.
When asked about whether this will also lead to increased headcount or other resources dedicated to autonomous driving tech, an Intel spokesperson told TechCrunch that while “Intel has been continuing to invest in automated driving by a series of acquisitions (Nirvana, Itseez, Yogitech), earmarking $250M of Intel Capital funds for automated driving capabilities and continued R&D,” the company is “not commenting on specific headcount at this time.”
Intel also provided the following when asked about how it sees the opportunity present in the autonomous driving market:
Automated driving is long term growth opportunity for Intel. We believe there is an incredible opportunity to reinvent the driving experience and it will take a global ecosystem for this vision to come to fruition. The new ADG organization will provide the necessary focus and support for our long-term investments needed for our strategic automated driving endeavors.

719,Ford will begin testing self-driving cars in Europe in 2017,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/29/ford-will-begin-testing-self-driving-cars-in-europe-in-2017/,2016/11/29,"
Ford’s pushing forward in its efforts to get autonomous cars on the road, with a plan to begin testing self-driving vehicles in Europe next year. The testing is in advance of extending its plans to debut an autonomous car specifically for ride-sharing fleets in the U.S. in 2021 to Europe, sometime in the future following that initial launch.
Ford tells TechCrunch it will be testing autonomous cars beginning at its UK-based Engineering Center in Essex, and that it will also begin testing at its Research & Advanced Engineering facilities located in Aachen and Cologne in Germany. The company said it’ll also have more to share about its specific European testing plans in the future, but noted that these facilities are already well-versed in Ford’s current and future driver-assist tech efforts, and so will be well-positioned to lead the autonomous driving efforts in Europe as well.
Ford also commissioned a survey of Europeans regarding their opinions about self-driving and what it might lead to in terms of freeing up time for and options for people. The survey of 4,000 found that 16 percent of respondents would trust autonomous cars to ferry their kids to or from school. 72 percent plan to use the time to have those phone conversations no one seems to have bandwidth for anymore, and 64 percent would use the reclaimed hours to eat.
Time freed up by autonomous commuting isn’t insubstantial – Ford says its data shows that Europeans spend, on average, 10 full days per year in their cars. You can do a lot with 10 days back … like binge watch all existing seasons of Geordie Shore, for instance.

Mobileye and Delphi announced a partnership to build an affordable self-driving car platform it could sell to automakers starting in 2019 earlier this year, and now Intel is joining the two automative suppliers to provide the chips used in their autonomous system.
Intel’s processors will power the interpretation of input from the primarily camera and radar-driven self-driving system created by Mobileye and Delphi, which is aiming to bring costs down for potential purchasers by sidestepping more expensive sensor tech like laser-based LiDAR.
Chipmaker Intel has done a lot to try to ensure it’s a key part of the stack when it comes to the autonomous driving wave of the future. The company will be investing $250 million in autonomous driving technologies via its venture wing, for instance, and it announced earlier this year it would be working with Mobileye and BMW on a self-driving car for that company with a target street date of 2021. Intel rival Qualcomm has also made big bets on autonomous driving, including the acquisition of NXP Semiconductor, a leading provider of automotive silicon.
Mobileye told reporters that while the BMW partnership and its general platform “are very similar in approach,” the BMW team-up is distinct, despite having Intel on board as a shared partner, according to Bloomberg. The Mobileye and Delphi system is set to premiere at CES in January, which means we’ll get our first look at what it can do very soon.
Mobileye Chief Communications Officer Dan Galves provided the following statement to TechCrunch about the addition of Intel to the partnership:
Today’s news is an extension to the autonomous vehicle cooperation Delphi and Mobileye announced in August, when it was noted that there would be a companion chip in addition to Mobileye’s EyeQ®4 / 5 that would be used in the system. Delphi and Mobileye are providing all the software required for the system, which will run in combination on Mobileye’s EyeQ®4 / 5, and Intel will provide incremental computer processing power. As outlined in August, Mobileye will provide software to process 8-camera surround view, Road Experience Management (REM) mapping, and reinforcement learning algorithms for driving policy, while Delphi will provide processing of radar and Lidar sensor data, driving control software through their Ottomatika division, and vehicle integration capabilities.

Nissan’s doing its first big push into internet-connected cars, and the first steps are tentative, as you might expect from something as sensitive as provided a direct line to the internet to a vehicle: The Japanese automaker will be offering an option on new vehicle that provides notifications to drivers when they need to take the car in for maintenance or service.
The option will be available in select models, and with roll-out starting in Japan and India beginning in 2017, with planned deployment in additional markets continuing through and including 2020. Nissan also plans to sell the additional gadget needed to provide access to the new connected service, which can also work on older models via retrofit. It’s hoping to eventually see around 30 percent of its existing cars offering the capability to drivers.
Connected services are not just table stakes or value-add for Nissan customers; the automaker is hoping to drive considerable revenue from the new segment, with Nissan Corporate VP Kent O’Hara telling reporters that the idea is to have connectivity and other tech-related services drive up to 25 percent of Nissan’s post-sales revenue by around 2022, according to Reuters.

A new joint venture between major carmakers will attempt to make it easier to get around Europe using electric cars, thanks to a network of chargers with up to 350 kW charging capacity, which could drastically reduce overall charging times compared to what’s available today. The team-up includes BMW, Daimler, Ford and Volkswagen, and plans for roll-out of the fast-charging stations call for installations to start in 2017.
Initially, the venture has identified 400 sites in Europe, with the ultimate aim of delivering as many as “thousands” of charge points by 2020 (which is, not coincidentally, around when many of the product lines of the participating car makers are expected to skew more heavily towards EVs).
The base technology upon which the network will be based is called Combined Charging System (CCS), which is a quick-charging method that uses a combo AC/DC connector referred to as the “Combo Coupler” in order to deliver a max 350 kW delivery charging rate. The standard is supported by BW, BMW, Daimler, and Ford, but also by Hyundai, GM and FCA.
The newly released Chevy Bolt uses CCS, for instance, and the standard is controlled by the Charging Interface Initiative, a group founded by Audi, BMW, Daimler, VW and more specifically to push CCS as an industry standard. Tesla joined the standards body in March of this year, and was reported in February to be working on an adapter that would help it support the standard used by CCS chargers.

Hyundai is launching a new website called “Click to Buy” in the UK, where customers can purchase its cars directly with fixed pricing and no haggling. The online model of car sales is one that Tesla employs widely for its own vehicles, owing in part to its inability to run its own physical dealerships in many places.
The new Hyundai UK direct sales start January 6, 2017, and include the i10, i20, i30, Tucson and Santa Fe as available models with the planned addition of other cars in the Hyundai range in the weeks following launch. The website also includes custom configuration options, trade-in pricing for existing vehicle, finance options and direct payment of deposits.
For those using the finance options, there’s an additional step for signing legal paperwork and picking up the vehicle, as well as dropping off trade-in, and Hyundai is working with participating dealers to complete this part of the process. But for customers paying for their vehicle outright, Hyundai says its possible to buy a new car in “less than five minutes,” with home delivery and even pick-up of a trade-in vehicle also available as paid add-on options.
Hyundai has been operating digital online “stores” for a couple of years, but this is the first time they’ve offered the ability to purchase directly.

The next big gold rush




Over the past several years, the popularity of “sharing economy” models has skyrocketed — driven largely by stratospheric valuations for companies like Airbnb and Uber. The key to success has been finding a category with high demand but low capacity utilization, then relentlessly focusing on the customer experience to improve accessibility and trust. Although vehicles are among the most expensive assets purchased by consumers, their historical utilization rate has generally hovered around a dismal 4 percent.
Rideshare operators, dedicated to making on-demand transportation both cheaper and more accessible, represent the best current opportunity to start chipping away at this massive inefficiency. Within the next decade, the arrival of autonomous cars will supercharge this trend, with some estimates pointing to average vehicle utilization rate of nearly 10X today’s levels. However, focusing solely on a vehicle’s use in personal mobility overlooks another, more immediate, opportunity to drive shared value.
As the latest generation of vehicles rolls off the lot with native internet access and a host of advanced sensors, their data and communication infrastructure can provide a distinct opportunity for new services.
Some estimates show that by 2020, up to 98 percent of new vehicles will ship with internet connectivity as a standard feature. In fact, this connectivity is not only something consumers are increasingly demanding in order to access premium services, but also as an important precursor to autonomous functionality. The next generation of self-driving cars will use the internet to transmit coordinates to each other, communicate with local infrastructure and signal authorities in the event of emergencies (in addition to a host of other infotainment-driven functions). According to one estimate from Hitachi, connected cars will upload 25 gigabytes of data to the cloud per hour.
It’s not too early to start thinking more broadly about the role that cars play in today’s society. 
As we approach higher rates of internet connectivity among vehicles on the road, we can unlock new opportunities to drive value from the network as a whole. For example, companies like Veniam are looking to turn a fleet of connected vehicles into a mesh network with the capability of blanketing a city with internet access. In Veniam’s case, this is being done by installing Wi-Fi hotspots onto government-owned vehicles driving predictable daily routes. By comparison, a network of private cars has the potential to provide a much denser footprint with higher fidelity.
Another potential source of value is visual data collection. While today’s new production vehicles are increasingly being stuffed with high-quality cameras and sensors, their use is mostly restricted to supporting safety features like collision avoidance or adaptive cruise control. However, by combining real-time data with the capability to send data to the cloud, a distributed network of private vehicles can generate a broader set of insights. We saw the first order of this phenomenon play out using mobile phones to map traffic patterns, with Waze as a standout winner. The second order will entail deeper integration with embedded vision systems — providing real-time tracking of things like roadside accidents and availability of parking spots.
Aside from the visual data, there is also tremendous value in behavioral data. As every major car company scrambles to build its own autonomous navigation software, companies like Google and Tesla continue to extend their lead from ongoing pilots. The reason is that these companies prioritized data collection early on — standardizing internet connectivity in their vehicles and monitoring driving behavior as soon as rubber met the road.

Conversely, while companies like Ford and GM have far more cars in public hands, they have neither the infrastructure to collect the associated data nor the human capital to analyze it. Even Uber, which monitors behavior at the fleet level, lacks consistent access to camera feeds, which makes it difficult to put that behavior in context.
This could all change with newer model cars. For example, Ford might ask a driver to take a slight detour on their route home in order to model their behavior at a tricky four-way stop sign. Similarly, insurance companies could ask to observe ongoing driving behavior in order to determine a personalized risk assessment. The result of this approach would be a much more accurate window on consumers, which could be used to accelerate learning and improve the product experience.
While fully autonomous cars might still be some years off, it’s not too early to start thinking more broadly about the role that cars play in today’s society. Expanding access to on-demand transportation is certainly a step in the right direction, but still represents just one component of a much larger (and more exciting) picture of the shared economy.

725,Charge trucks tackle race tracks,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/28/charge-trucks-tackle-race-tracks/,2016/11/28,"
Charge, an Oxford, UK-based electric vehicle company, is testing its prototypes in the most time-honored way: at the races.
Since the dawn of the automotive age, inventors and manufacturers have taken their cars to the track to test their capabilities. These trucks aren’t racing, though; they’re the official support vehicles for the Formula E all-electric racing series. Formula E provides a particular advantage for Charge: the series uses urban street courses rather than tracks, the exact environment where Charge vehicles will be operating when they’re ready for the market.
Charge plans to build small delivery vehicles and larger, full-sized trucks to fit a variety of fleet needs. The description of the vehicles seems to hint at a plug-in hybrid powertrain, since the trucks will all be zero-emissions for the first 100 miles, but a “dual mode” will allow for a range of up to 500 miles via a motor that recharges the batteries.
The trucks are also designed to be modular, and Charge says that it will take one person four hours to assemble one truck. According to Charge’s math, ten men working two shifts a day could build 10,000 trucks annually. What this means to Charge is that it should be easy to scale their operations and manufacturing globally, allowing small facilities to build trucks closer to where they’ll be used rather than shipping them globally from a hub in the UK. It’s an idea both Local Motors and OX are investigating as well.
Charge’s involvement in racing doesn’t end with ferrying goods around race courses. The company is also involved in Roborace, the autonomous support race that will begin in earnest next season. Charge is helping the series develop the Robocar’s power electronics and motors.
The first Charge factories will open in 2017 near the company’s headquarters, with a goal of producing electric (or hybrid electric) trucks at a price “in line with conventional trucks.”

726,BlackBerry among 3 organizations set to test self-driving cars on Ontario roads,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/28/blackberry-among-3-organizations-set-to-test-self-driving-cars-on-ontario-roads/,2016/11/28,"
Canadian self-driving vehicle tests are about to kick off on Ontario public roads, with three groups approved to take part in a pilot licensing program that allows autonomous testing with a safety driver behind the wheel. BlackBerry is one of the three, along with the University of Waterloo’s Centre for Automotive Research and Erwin Hymer Group, a German maker of motorhomes and other leisure vehicles, reports The Globe and Mail.
The province is hoping to become a place automakers come to try out their self-driving tech, among a short but growing list of places around the world where testing those technologies is allowed on public roadways. The news of these three initial permit owners follows the provincial government’s announcement of their intent to allow such testing late last year.
Ontario’s advantage in providing a site for testing could lie in its variable weather; the province enjoys four full seasons, and provides a testbed for extreme conditions in its northern reaches. Other sites like Michigan, which is building a massive 335-acre test facility, offer similar road conditions, but Ontario could prove unique in just how intense it can get in terms of inclement weather systems – and any road in the province is fair game for testing under the rules put forward by the province.
Waterloo’s engineering talent, combined with Toronto’s academic expertise in machine learning and sizeable presence and investment by major automakers including GM, Toyota and others might also help Ontario press its advantage in the early days of autonomous driving development.
If you happen to live in the province (which I do), don’t expect to see autonomous test vehicles on the road just yet – the first trials from this initial group of participants are expected to kick off in early 2017.

From recording to reacting: Neural networks are changing notions of surveillance




This summer saw the inevitable controversy arise when a Tesla automobile was involved in a fatal traffic accident while operating in its headline-grabbing Autopilot mode. While early reports seem to point toward human error by both parties involved (the truck driver turning across traffic without sufficient time and space, and the Tesla driver allegedly watching a movie while behind the wheel), many people are debating what responsibility falls onto Tesla and its autonomous-driving functions.
Many have called out Musk’s “open beta” roll-out of the technology as irresponsible and dangerous, while others have wondered how a system with supposed redundancies could have misread the emergency situation so poorly. Regardless, it’s put the entire industry of autonomous cars under scrutiny as people ask themselves whether this is the kind of technology that should be on the road at all.
The fact of the matter is that this all stems from the age-old human instinct to fear things they do not understand. Autonomous-driving technology has been intentionally marketed as a hyper-advanced, quantum leap in car technology, closer resembling a NASA planetary rover in terms of technology than a Ford Focus. In reality though, it’s a step or two along the spectrum upon which we’ve been on for a long, long time: increasingly advanced driver safety systems.
Every car today features at least a few of these: airbags, ABS braking and traction control systems, to name a few. These safety features were all designed with the aim of reducing the huge number of vehicle injuries and fatalities every year, and it can be argued that all have done so. That being said, every single one of these technologies has had serious, fatal malfunctions, particularly in early roll-out, but even in mature phases of the technology.
New solutions will always have unfortunate growing pains that sadly result in the loss of human life.
Take for example airbag systems. Between 1990 and 2007, the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recorded 284 fatalities tied to airbags. While some of these were related to people of small stature, or extremely close driver positioning to the airbag ejection point, others were related to faulty deployment — or, in other words, a malfunction of the technology.
Since initial introduction in the early 1970s, airbags have gone under numerous revisions and improvements to safety. Despite these improvements, in 2016, malfunctions in this technology still remain, most recently with airbag maker Takata having to issue the largest recall in history, involving over 28 million cars and with an associated death toll of at least 11 so far.
Assistive Braking Systems (ABS) doesn’t enjoy a clean record, either. Numerous studies have indicated that ABS systems can actually cause a higher incidence of dangerous vehicle rollovers in certain situations.

Despite these edge cases of malfunction, or risks in marginal conditions, both airbags and ABS technologies enjoy a ubiquitous presence in cars. In fact, most consumers would simply not buy a car without these features today. It’s recognized that, while not perfect, these systems on the balance provide greater safety than otherwise. Malfunctions have dogged both technologies for decades, but nobody has thrown out the baby with the bath water, so to speak.
Yet here we are with what amounts to more advanced versions of cruise control — which some companies have branded “autopilot” or “autonomous” to appeal to our ever-increasing “technophilia” — and we hold it up to a far higher standard than these preceding technologies. Broken down into constituent parts, these systems could be called things like “blind-spot warning system” and “rear-end collision avoidance” and they would likely be embraced eagerly. But when brought together under such terms as “artificial intelligence” or “self-driving,” people seem to immediately gain a sense of unease about the whole affair.
The fact of the matter is that our vehicles are creeping up a trajectory of better safety through technology that we’ve always been on. Rolling out new solutions will always have unfortunate growing pains that sadly result in the loss of human life, but the stark reality is that they always have. Our inherent anxiousness or even fear of cars taking away our control of the vehicle is unfounded, because, in many ways, we’ve already let them.

728,Faraday Future’s factory construction paused; shipping timelines at risk,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/24/faraday-futures-factory-construction-paused-shipping-timelines-at-risk/,2016/11/24,"
Electric vehicle maker Faraday Future may not be able to make its first cars in time to hit its 2017 shipping deadlines, according to a new report by the Financial Times on Thursday. It’s hard to ship a car when your factory itself isn’t finished — FF’s Nevada-based manufacturing facility broke ground in April, but construction has since been paused because, according to state treasurer Dan Schwartz speaking to the FT, it hasn’t paid bills owed by the company to its construction partner.
The delay is temporary, according to comments made by general contractor Aecom, which is working with Faraday on the project, and construction will resume some time in early 2017. That’s going to push out the completion date considerably, and will make it quite difficult for FF to make its previously stated production timeline. FT also spoke to an anonymous former employee who said deliveries to customers within the 2017 time frame were “not possible.”
Part of the issue may be that primary financial backer LeEco has publicly acknowledged difficulties related to available cash, and the large investment its made in building cars, both itself and via partners like Faraday Future, was cited as one cause. LeEco recently raised an additional $600 million, but given Faraday’s financial reliance on LeEco, the Chinese company’s cash problems combined with this news of the factory delay don’t bode well.
Faraday Future has promised to show off its first production vehicle (pictured in a spy shot above) at CES in January, after revealing a Batmobile-like FFZERO1 concept last year. We’ll likely learn more about its anticipated schedule for delivering said vehicle at that time, too, and there will clearly be a lot riding on what they present at the show.

Maserati was said to be looking at 2020 as the target time frame for its first production electric vehicle, and now the company has confirmed to Autocar that a battery-powered electric drivetrain option will be made available in 2020 for its Alfieri two-seater sports car.
The EV version will follow the conventional fuel-based V6-powered Alfieri, which is slated to make its product debut some time in 2019. Part of the reason for the launch window being out further is that the chassis design used in the Alfieri requires weight savings and energy economy improvements, which Maserati is currently working on; its existing product design plans are due for refresh after 2018.
The report of Maserati’s Alfieri plans follows an earlier account by Car and Driver that their first vehicle would be a “grand-touring coupe” rather than a direct competitor for the Tesla Model S, but that it would also likely be a significant departure for Maserati in terms of its signature vehicle design.

730,NHTSA spells out what your phone shouldn’t be able to do while driving,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/23/nhtsa-spells-out-what-your-phone-shouldnt-be-able-to-do-while-driving/,2016/11/23,"
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released new voluntary proposed guidelines for software makers and device manufacturers, including smartphone makers like Apple and Google, which aim to cut down on driver distraction from mobile apps and hardware.
These guidelines, which are again voluntary, are based on research about what factors have led to road-related deaths stemming from driver distraction. They include recommendations that device manufacturers build infotainment pairing in to gadgets like smartphones by default, and add a “Driver Mode” that will create a simplified user interface for the device when it’s being used in a vehicle.
Sound familiar? It should – Google has essentially complied with these recommendations with its latest update to Android Auto, which simplifies the interface with larger touch targets, allowing a user to more easily control navigation, music playback and more while they’re using their phone via a dash mount in their vehicle. It brings the Android Auto interface previously only available on specific in-car infotainment units to any compatible Android device. NHTSA’s guidelines ask for some further steps, however, including locking out certain functions.
NHTSA notes in the opening to the guidelines that 10 percent to the 2015 recorded traffic fatalities involved at least one distracted driver, which was up 8.8 percent from the previous year, hence the need for urgent action on trying to curb that trend. NHTSA also defines three kinds of distraction it aims to correct with these voluntary measures: visual, manual (i.e., requiring you to take your hands off the steering wheel) and cognitive (taking your mind of the road).
The proposed guidelines in this second phase of NHTSA’s recommendations include feature lock-outs that occur when a smartphone is paired with a car’s infotainment system – these would include blocking the ability to show video unrelated to driving on a device screen, blocking the display of some types of pictures or graphics, and preventing display from showing automatically scrolling text (apparently some people read while driving using this kind of app). Non-voice text entry in general and other lengthy text display designed for reading is also on the proposed block list.
Driver Mode, in NHTSA’s proposal, would block those locked out features but offer a simplified, easier to use interface on the device itself for when pairing while driving isn’t an option or isn’t used by a driver. NHTSA doesn’t want passengers to be blocked from full use of their device, however, so it also asks for the development of tech that can automatically distinguish between drivers and passengers during use and lock out features only for drivers.
This last bit might be the tallest order among these recommendations in terms of getting OEM buy-in; making things like CarPlay and Android Auto available even when a device isn’t connected to an in-car infotainment system is relatively simple, but building in tech that automatically limits access to features in certain scenarios like driving, and that can also distinguish the difference between use by a passenger and use by a driver is a much bigger ask.
Even if its technically feasible, I can’t imagine smartphone makers being enthusiastic about building features into phones that specifically lock down aspects of their utility temporarily without user input. Still, NHTSA is calling for open comments so we’ll see how device makers respond.

731,Watch McLaren’s fully electric P1 go through some intense testing,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/23/watch-mclarens-fully-electric-p1-go-through-some-intense-testing/,2016/11/23,"

McLaren makes supercars, and to make those cars requires a lot of technical expertise and rigorous engineering. The new McLaren P1 fully electric car is no different. This open-top vehicle hit the test track recently with a seasoned driver at the helm – and the resulting video (via Jalopnik) is pretty intense.
McLaren’s outdone itself with the promo copy on this exciting new vehicle, so I’ll let them take it from here:
The diminutive McLaren P1™ differs from its larger brother in two important ways. Firstly, it has a central driving position, just like the iconic McLaren F1. Then, secondly, young owners will be able to experience what adults never could: an open-top McLaren P1™. It retains McLaren’s signature dihedral doors and has a three-speed transmission with a reverse gear. And, as with every McLaren, its acceleration is startling. The zero to maximum speed (3mph) dash takes just two seconds. As it’s the most compact model in the McLaren range, drivers should ideally be between three and six years of age, but we wouldn’t blame those who are slightly more mature for wanting to take it for a spin…

732,"Draper Nexus closes $175 million fund, LP’s include Panasonic, Canon and other Japanese tech giants",https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/22/draper-nexus-closes-175-million-fund-lps-include-panasonic-canon-and-other-japanese-tech-giants/,2016/11/22,"
Early stage venture firm, Draper Nexus, has closed its second fund at $175 million, according to Managing Director Q Motiwala. Its debut fund closed in 2013, at $50 million.
Limited partners in Draper Nexus are global tech conglomerates, primarily based in Japan.
For its second fund, the firm signed up about 20 LP’s including Panasonic, Hitachi, Kyocera, Shimizu, NEC, Canon and others. Most are global brands that early-stage tech entrepreneurs, whether they’re building enterprise software or consumer hardware, would love to include on their client rosters.
Draper Nexus was an early backer of marketing firm LiveRamp, AI-based cybersecurity providers Cylance, autonomous vehicle tech firm Nauto, and Enlighted, makers of smart lighting systems for commercial buildings.
Though the firm is young, it has already chalked up eight exits, most notably with its investment in Shift, a software-testing company that went public on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 2014. The company is thriving and Draper Nexus has retained shares in the business.
What makes Draper Nexus stand out from other, larger and older venture firms in Silicon Valley is an emphasis on helping startups lock in their first, or biggest enterprise customers.
Motiwala said, “We invest in companies that are not just exciting to us, but where we know we can bring some customer or channel partnership advantages to them. The large corporations in our fund have skin in the game.”
The firm assigns multiple partners to each startup, working to get them agreements with corporations and executives they would have had a hard time just meeting on their own.
With its second fund, Draper Nexus plans to back companies in transportation or mobility, cybersecurity, big data as it applies to complex industries such as insurance or logistics, AI and robotics.
About one-third of Draper Nexus’ investing team is based in Tokyo, and the rest is in San Mateo. The fund sometimes invests in companies that start with a regional focus on Japan.
In Japan, Motiwala said, Draper Nexus may back new marketing automation and adtech, startups. The country’s enterprise software providers have yet to catch up to the U.S. in these segments.
Up to 80% of Draper Nexus’ money is invested in early stage deals, and that’s a focus they want to maintain with their second fund.
They usually seek to co-invest with other firms, and sign a check up to $5 million in Series A deals. If they missed a particularly good opportunity, partners said, they will look at Series B deals. About 5% of Draper Nexus investments go to seed-stage deals, and the firm typically invests $250,000.
A rising star in the firm, senior associate Deepak Jagannathan, is helping to run a new program for Draper Nexus with the close of its second fund.
Dubbed GoPilot, the initiative will serve as something of an accelerator for already formed and funded companies.
Draper Nexus will invite early stage startups with enterprise software, services or hardware to pitch five to ten corporations in a given field at something like a closed demo day.
Startups that succeed walk away with 2 enterprise clients or business development agreements after they pitch. And Draper Nexus will put $50,000 in funding, at founder-friendly terms, into the startup. The funding will go to support the development of joint projects with large corporate partners.
“We have enabled more than 50 pilot projects already here, and were able to create a kind of template that works to make these things come together in a shorter period of time than it would normally take a startup. It’s a really important milestone,” Jagannathan said.
Meanwhile, corporations are happy to have external money support a pilot project that could otherwise be delayed while they try to find internal budget.
Draper Nexus also works to make sure that the terms of any business development deals are founder-friendly, so startups can, for example, retain intellectual property or avoid exclusivity that could limit their growth.

733,The 2017 Toyota Yaris points to the future of cars,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/22/the-2017-toyota-yaris-points-to-the-future-of-cars/,2016/11/22,"
When presented with a list of cars to test drive, the 2017 Toyota Yaris might not jump out at most people as the top choice. It’s not fancy, and it’s not a status symbol, but it’s got all the safety tech a person could want — and a touch screen — for $16,815.
The test Yaris had not one single extra. The optional equipment column was a big blank space. The 6-speed transmission was manual, the seat adjustment was manual; I almost expected to have to wind the windows down, but they were indeed electric. The 1.5-liter 4-cylinder engine’s 105 hp was fine for getting around town and hopping on the highway, but it’s not going to win you any prizes at Friday night drag races.
While the optional equipment column was bare, the standard equipment list was long. The Yaris, Toyota’s least expensive model, has Toyota Safety Sense, which features a low-speed precollision system that uses a camera-and-laser combo to sense and impending crash and alert the driver. The system will apply the brakes if necessary, and it’s capable of scrubbing up to 19 mph of speed.
There’s also a lane departure alert to let you know if you’re straying from your lane. And automatic high beams use a camera to detect oncoming vehicles and adjust the brightness of your headlights. Autonomous it is not, but it is a lot of safety technology for the money.
In the center console, there’s a 7-inch color touch screen, which surprised me. I poked the screen out of habit and was happy to see it respond. It’s got USB ports and Bluetooth so you can hook up your phone and use it hands-free. The Connected Service Suite gives you access to Pandora, Aha, and Stitcher.
There are a couple of obvious groups of likely buyers for a car like the new Yaris. First-time buyers who need a car but don’t have loads of cash would do well to consider the humble Yaris. It’s also great for parents who want to buy safe, boring wheels for a new driver.
Then there are people who don’t like bells or whistles or anything newfangled in their cars. They’re still driving Toyotas from the late 1980s. Those drivers should consider upgrading to the 2017 Yaris — you won’t be overwhelmed by buttons and doodads, but you will get the latest in safety technology. And just a bit of new-car smell.
The 2017 Toyota Yaris points toward the near future of vehicles. This kind of safety and connected car tech is getting cheaper and more ubiquitous, and we’ll find it in more and less expensive cars as new NHTSA rules take effect. Making this technology standard in cars with lower price points is critical for moving the needle on the number of fatal vehicle crashes in the United States.

Michigan’s new American Center for Mobility at the historic Willow Run one-time manufacturing complex broke ground this week, paving the way for the launch of the technologically advanced testbed for autonomous and connected vehicles. The 335-acre site will play host to a new facility designed to help automakers and other stakeholders globally test their cars, connected infrastructure tech, vehicle communication systems and more across a variety of conditions in the hopes of speeding up the roll-out of this tech for a safer driving future.
The new test facility, which was announced earlier this year, is designed to help Michigan reaffirm its position at the head of the U.S. automotive industry, with an eye to the changing priorities of the field given the rapid improvements being made in autonomous driving tech. The Willow Run site will play host to a brand new facility designed not only for testing, but also for research, product development, education and more.

It’s also about helping create and maintain voluntary industry standards for autonomous and connected vehicle tech going forward. The National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration presented draft guidelines for broad industry use around self-driving tech, but in addition to open comment and debate among the stakeholders involved, it makes sense that an actual full-scale testing facility where the parties involved can all interact and conduct research in tandem would help facilitate some kind of consensus building.

As you can see from the architectural images and diagrams representing what the site will look like when completed, miniature mock cities, highways, off ramps, rail crossings and more are part of the plan. In theory, the facility will offer a microcosm of most scenarios a car can expect to encounter in the real world, complete with the benefit of four seasons of weather including rain, ice and snow that’s a built-in Michigan benefit.
Michigan is investing in autonomous driving tech in a number of different ways, including via another project to build a testing ground led by Flint’s Kettering University, and University of Michigan opened its own test environment, dubbed “Mcity,” in Ann Arbor last year. The Willow Run project will be the largest in scope, however.

735,Uber launches in Bangladesh to continue its emerging market push,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/22/uber-bangladesh/,2016/11/22,"
With a global presence that already spans more than 450 cities worldwide, it isn’t often that Uber expands into new countries, but today the U.S. ride-sharing giant drove into Bangladesh for the first time.
The launch is capital city Dhaka is initially fairly limited but, like other Uber expansions, the plan is to open up to more parts of the city and beyond as more drivers register to use the service. With a population of 150 million people (and 18 million alone in Dhaka), Bangladesh could represent a lucrative new market for Uber but there are some emerging market factors to contend with.
For one thing, internet access stands at just 11 percent of the population despite more than 130 million active cell phones in the country. That’s something which mobile giant Telenor said makes the internet an “elite phenomenon,” and it clearly represents a huge challenge for any online business. In response to that, Uber has teamed up with Grameenphone, Bangladesh’s largest mobile carrier which is owned by Telenor, to help promote the service. Grameenphone was the conduit to launch a mobile health initiative in Bangladesh earlier this year, such is the power of mobile carriers in emerging markets.
In addition, as in other parts of South Asia and the surrounding areas, there’s a scarcity of credit and debit cards among consumers in Bangladesh. But Uber has been offering cash payments for some time, which helps overcome that issue.
Uber entered Pakistan, a country with a population of over 180 million, in March as part of a reported $250 million strategy to widen its position in Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, according to Reuters. These countries are far, far away from its global HQ in San Francisco and self-driving car pilot in Pittsburgh, which is exactly why it will be fascinating to see whether the firm can navigate the challenges of emerging markets and build out successful local businesses under very different conditions.

736,Volkswagen will begin making electric cars in North America in 2021,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/22/volkswagen-will-begin-making-electric-cars-in-north-america-in-2021/,2016/11/22,"
Volkswagen’s EV plans include manufacturing in North America starting in 2021, according to the company. The new production expansion is part of VW’s goal to ramp up to sales of 1 million electric vehicles globally by 2025, as electric becomes “the strategic core of the VW brand,” according to Volkswagen brand lead Herbert Diess speaking to Automotive News. Part of the electric push is to help VW increase its profit margin long-term, with EVs replacing fuel-burning models that aren’t selling well.
Volkswagen has Mexican assembly facilities for the Jetta, Golf and Beetle, but only has a single factory in the U.S. currently, while the vast majority of its manufacturing facilities are located in Europe. The company will be “stepping up” activities in the U.S., according to Diess, with a focus on producing vehicles that resonate with that market, including large SUVs and limousines, according to the brand leader.
While Volkswagen already offers electric drive version of existing vehicles, including the Golf, the company’s first pure EV design debuted in September at the Paris Motor Show. The I.D. concept is designed for production beginning in 2020, VW said at the time.

737,"Ola, Uber’s rival in India, launches an in-car entertainment platform for passengers",https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/22/ola-play/,2016/11/22,"
Ola, Uber’s main rival in India, has launched a connected car entertainment platform for its vehicles to make its trips more luxurious.
Nobody wants to be stuck in a cab for a long and boring ride — and the rides can be long in India’s traffic clogged cities. ‘Ola Play’ takes the idea of in-trip entertainment, which we’ve previous seen through initiatives like Uber’s integration with Spotify and Pandora, to the next level.
It features two touch-sensitive consoles — one for driver and one for passenger — which include entertainment options, trip-based features, an internet browser and more. It also syncs with a passenger’s phone, to enable them to use services like Apple Music, Sony LIV, Audio Compass and Fynd from their own device on the screens.
In addition to participation and partnerships from companies like Apple, Ola worked with India-based automotive firm Mahindra and Mahindra and Qualcomm on the hardware.
We’ve seen Ola argue that its rides must include entertainment features before. Last year, it added free in-car WiFi to its cars — at the same time Uber did — with the argument that its passengers should be able to enjoy a quality experience and help battle India’s often patchy mobile network signals. It took that a step further this year when it announced an ambitious plan to turn those roaming Wi-Fi cars into municipal Wi-Fi networks that Ola customers can access.
Now, with Ola Play, it is once again putting the focus on experience. The service be available within its high-end Ola Prime cars in Bengaluru, Mumbai and Delhi for “select customers,” but the plan is to increase Ola Play so that it covers more than 50,000 vehicles across India by March 2017.

It will be interesting to see what features Ola plans for the in-car platform, since it is already working with some brands — including fashion e-commerce firm Myntra — on ‘Ola Select,’ its benefits program which include the Wi-Fi package. It wouldn’t be too difficult to provide in-car shopping, for example, from a particular company to the potential benefit of both passenger and service provider.
Ola is locked in an intense battle with Uber, with the U.S. company diverting increased resources into India following the (impending) sale of its business unit in China in Didi Chuxing. Ola covers more cities in India than Uber right now, and evidence suggests it is just ahead in major cities, but Uber is upping its focus with new features for India and expansion plans, so Ola is forging ahead with its entertainment push to sway more affluent users — the kind that might be acquainted with Uber — to its service.
“I believe this will completely transform the consumer’s ride experience, giving the user the power to control the interactions within the car, and usher in a new era in the ride-sharing industry,” Ola co-founder and CEO Bhavish Aggarwal said in a statement.
“With over 60 million minutes spent in Ola rides every day, the impact on consumer comfort, convenience and productivity can be transformative. This will further propel ride-sharing as the first choice of mobility for many more millions,”Aggarwal added.
The launch also comes amid speculation that Ola is close to raising new funding. The company raised $500 million one year ago and, with Southeast Asia-based ally Grab raising a blockbuster $750 million despite operating in a smaller market, Ola will be hoping for a windfall, too. Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that Ola is close to raising $600 million — no doubt one of the objectives of today’s splashy and glamorous announcement is to help any ongoing investment talks progress.

738,NextEV’s new NIO EP9 electric supercar holds a Nürburgring world record,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/21/nextevs-new-nio-ep9-electric-supercar-holds-a-nurburgring-world-record/,2016/11/21,"

Chinese electric car maker NextEV has debuted its NIO brand, along with the first car from that electric car line, called the EP9. The first vehicle it revealed is already a world-record holder: it has the fastest lap time for an EV at the Nürbhurgring Nordschliefe test track in Germany, one of the most famous proving grounds for supercars.
The EP9 also beat the EV record at France’s Circuit Paul Ricard by around 50 seconds. EP9’s specs include a 0-124mph speed of 7.1 seconds, and a top speed of around 200mph. It also has a 0-60mph time of 2.7 seconds – which, astute EV fans will note, is actually 0.2 seconds slower than the current production model of the Tesla P100D with the Ludicrous Mode option (and soon to be 0.3 seconds slower, thanks to a speed-boosting easter egg update going out to Teslas in December).
Tesla has called its P100D the “fastest production car in the world,” so the EP9’s claim of being the “world’s fastest electric car” will definitely need direct head-to-head testing to prove the validity of one or the other. The EP9 isn’t quite a product vehicle yet, however – today’s unveiling isn’t a sales announcement.

The performance is impressive, however, and the car also has a charging system designed to provide a full “tank” in just 45 minutes, with a max range of around 265 miles. The EP9 is probably a stage-setter for NIO overall, as the company says it’s intended to be a “best-in-class” and “showcase” product in a release announcing the car.
NextEV’s U.S. CEO Padmasree Warrior explained in an interview with TechCrunch last December that she was looking for an opportunity to “build something from the ground up and make it big” in taking on the role at NextEV, and this debut car from the company definitely looks to fit that bill.

739,Chariot launches advance ride reservations for commuters,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/21/chariot-launches-advance-ride-reservations-for-on-demand-commuters/,2016/11/21,"
Chariot, the Ford-owned collaborative carpooling service currently operating in the Bay area, has launched advance reservations, letting riders book a seat on a Chariot up to seven days ahead of their actual trip. Previously, the only option was to grab a ride ad-hoc shortly before departure, an option which will continue to be offered alongside advance scheduling.
The decision to add an advance booking option was made because Chariot found that a lot of its users were using the service in predictable patterns, with regular frequency and along the same routes. It makes sense, given that Chariot is often used either for a rider’s entire commute, or for the first- or last-mile of a trip to and from work, getting riders from their homes or offices to a main transit artery like Caltrain, BART or the ferry.
Chariot will send a text to a rider who books in advance between 10 and 15 minutes before they need to be at their pickup spot, with the exact time of the pickup. The company says it built the feature in just a month, and is deploying it in its launch market of SF in hopes of refining it before it expands its overall services to additional cities over “the coming months.” Most recently, Chariot started running a last-mile route in Austin ahead of a wide public launch in the city happening in the next few weeks.

“About 80 percent of our riders are taking Chariot more or less within 15 minutes of the same time four or five days a week,” explained Chariot founder and CEO Ali Vahabzadeh in an interview. “We can’t think of anything more routine than someone’s commute, so why not make things easier and provide the ability to schedule this, and then it’s just one less thing they have to worry about when they wake up in the morning.”
Chariot will continue to offer instant on-demand service, too, and isn’t setting aside a specific amount of seats for either option. The company is using this launch to determine how much riders value this option as compared to others in preparation for rollout of its services to other city in the new year.
Remember that Chariot was acquired by Ford Smart Mobility earlier this year – I asked Vahabzadeh how this fits in with the carmaker’s larger plans around the future of transportation.
“If we think about Ford Smart Mobility’s overall efforts, we want to make it as easy as possible for the urban dweller to get around, and every city’s needs are different,” he explained. “This allows us to cater to people who either want to grab a ride when they’re ready, whenever they’re ready. Or there may are certain markets or cohorts of riders who want to plan out the week’s commute the way they plan out their work calendar.”
Chariot adds another testing ground for Ford to sound out the new topography of transportation in a post- or hybrid-ownership future for cars, especially in an urban setting. This product launch should help with Chariot’s overall appeal, and make sure it has more flexibility in markets outside of SF as it continues its expansion.

740,Self-driving car startup Nutonomy to begin road tests in Boston,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/21/nutonomy-boston/,2016/11/21,"
Self-driving taxi startup Nutonomy is expanding its autonomous vehicle trials to roads in the U.S. after it agreed to a partnership with City of Boston and the Massachusetts Department of Transportation.
Nutonomy was spun out of the MIT and is headquartered in Boston, but it initially begin trialling its ‘robo’ taxi service in Singapore in August, narrowly beating Uber — which is conducting tests in Pittsburgh — to the punch. Nutonomy’s relationship with the Singaporean government, which was part of its most recent $16 million funding round, was critical to helping it get a start in the Southeast Asia city-state, where it aims to launch a commercial service to the public by 2018.
In a statement, Nutonomy said it will begin testing Raymond L. Flynn Marine Park in the Seaport section of Boston before the end of this year. It plans to use its self-driving Renault Zoe electric vehicle which includes its software system and engineers on-board to observe and take the wheel if and when necessary. The cars won’t be tasked with collecting passengers, however, unlike Uber’s autonomous vehicles.
Nutonomy is working with Grab, Southeast Asia’s billion-dollar Uber rival, in Singapore to help it get access to more data and ferry its customers from A to B. It remains unclear whether it will forge a similar partnership with Lyft — a key Grab ally in the U.S. — in order to actually collect passengers in the U.S. For one, though, it does have the support of government officials who will help “expand the testing area to other parts of the city in the near future,” Nutonomy said.
“Boston is ready to lead the charge on self-driving vehicles, and I am committed to ensuring autonomous vehicles will benefit Boston’s residents. This is an exciting step forward, and together with our public and private partners, we will continue to lead the way in creating a safe, reliable and equitable mobility plan for Boston’s residents,” city mayor Martin J. Walsh said in a statement.

Tesla revealed it would be building all vehicles complete with all the hardware onboard they need to achieve full self-driving in the future, and also published a short demo video of the prototype software in action at the time. Now, a new video shows a self-driving Tesla making its way through a city neighbourhood complete with a lot of traffic and quite a few intersections.
The video provides a driver’s eye view of the trip, including a clear look at how the human behind the steering wheel (who’s there only for legal compliance reasons) never once touches either the wheel or the brake and gas pedals. The video also shows three separate views of what the Tesla optical cameras are seeing at all times during the drive, including colored overlays showing what the onboard computer is detecting in terms of objects and lane markers.
This new look at the fully self-driving version of Autopilot in action is definitely impressive, and helps boost confidence that Tesla might even be able to meet founder and CEO Elon Musk’s goal of doing a cross-country test drive sometime late next year.
There’s also a Benny Hill cut of the video, in case the Paint it Black backing track on the longer version is a bit too heavy for your tastes.

Tesla’s focusing on its work on autonomous driving as a huge potential gain for driver safety, but a video from a Tesla Model S P85D shows that some current features not related to self-driving are actually already helping prevent accidents.
Tesla owner Jason Hughes captured a narrow miss in his car using a rear-mounted dash cam, showing the moment a Prius coming up from behind clearly didn’t notice that he’d stopped to turn left into a parking lot.
The distracted Prius driver realizes late that he’s going to plow into the Tesla, and makes a turn toward the curb to avoid it. But by the time he’s reacted, the P85D is actually already clear of the danger zone, something Hughes attributes to his car’s instant acceleration, which comes from its electric motors’ ability to provide torque instantly, unlike in a fossil fuel-burning vehicle.
Hughes says he got back up the posted speed limit shortly after this clip ends, which gives you a sense of just how fast the P85D can accelerate. My own car definitely wouldn’t have fared as well in the same situation.

743,BMW and Baidu’s self-driving car partnership has reportedly run out of gas,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/18/bmw-baidu/,2016/11/18,"
It’s been an up-and-down week for Baidu and its autonomous-driving car vision. On the plus side, the Chinese tech firm yesterday announced that it had begun testing self-driving vehicles in Wuzhen. But, on the negative, its partnership with BMW has reportedly fallen through according to comments from executives.
BMW’s China CEO Olaf Kastner reportedly told Reuters that the alliance is over because “the development pace and the ideas of the two companies are a little different.”
Wang Jing, who leads the autonomous vehicles project at Baidu, added that his company is now “open for any partners, [and] actually I’m talking to many.”
Baidu declined to comment. BMW did not immediately respond to a request for comment; we’ll update this post if it does.
Baidu had been using a fleet of modified 3-series vehicles from BMW, with tests expanding to the U.S. earlier this year. However, its tests in Wuzhen are with vehicles supplied by Chinese automakers BYD, Chery and BAIC. In August, Baidu received permission to conduct similar tests in California.
Baidu is aiming to get its first production vehicles on the road using its technology by 2018, with a broader, mass production rollout targeted for 2021.
Tests aside, Baidu has invested considerable resources into the artificial intelligence and tech that powers its self-driving cars. It partnered with chip-maker NVIDIA to develop a “top-to-bottom” platform for autonomous vehicles. Elsewhere, the search giant was part of a $150 million investment in California-based LiDAR-maker Velodyne — alongside Ford — to help make its sensor components more affordable for mass market production.
BMW, meanwhile, is reportedly aiming to launch a fully self-driving vehicle in 2025. The German automaker has reportedly accelerated its electric vehicle plans following changes at the executive level, including a new CFO, and the merger of its marketing and sales divisions for Mini and BMW into a single organization.

744,Lyft wants more explicit protection of consumer data from NHTSA on self-driving,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/17/lyft-wants-more-explicit-protection-of-consumer-data-from-nhtsa-on-self-driving/,2016/11/17,"
Lyft has released extended comments regarding the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration’s guidelines on autonomous driving, released earlier this year. Lyft’s formal comments address a number of areas where it thinks the NHTSA policy is spot-on, including vehicle interiors designed to maximize passenger safety, but also outline some parts where they feel the government agency could improve its guidelines.
Lyft’s primary complaint seems to be that NHTSA doesn’t make it explicit in the guidelines that it’s not seeking consumer use data, specifically around identifying information including names, phone numbers, credit card info and usage data, including real-time and historic geolocation data. NHTSA’s policies encourage data sharing between OEMs and government agencies in order to speed the development of safe autonomous driving tech, but Lyft clearly wants to make sure that while doing so it can also continue to offer its customers the kind of privacy it ensures today.
The ride-hailing company also took time in its comments to outline where it fits in with highly autonomous vehicles (HAVs), basically as a network operator. It thinks that it and other ridesharing platforms are going to be key to educating consumers about how self-driving cars work, and what’s happening in real time with the vehicles when riders are using them. Lyft wants ridesharing’s role as an educational conduit for consumers made more formal in the guidelines, to basically spell out that it’s replacing human drivers as a way to explain how this whole thing works.
Lyft also wants more assurances that any HAV framework will apply nationally, and asks that provisions requiring individual licenses for each state be removed from the model guidelines NHTSA provides for adoption by individual states. Finally, it also wants Congress to award NHTSA more authority in terms of its statutory exemption powers when it comes to authorizing testing and introduction of automated driving technologies.
The full letter from Lyft to NHTSA is embedded below.

Tesla Easter eggs are a lot more interesting than most of those found in video games: case in point, its next one will boost the acceleration of the P100D variant of its Model S up to a 2.4-second 0-60 mph time with Ludicrous Mode, with a quarter-mile achievable in as little as 10.6 seconds. The P100D Model X will also get a slight boost, with 0.1 second shaved off both times.
The current P100D with Ludicrous Mode is already the fastest production car in the world, according to Tesla, but the 0.1-second improvement will put it at the very top of the heap for 0-60 acceleration, beating out the $845K Porsche 918 Spyder — which also claims a 2.5-second time for that standard measure of performance.
Tesla’s delivering the speed boost via a software update coming next month. While Tesla has delivered performance improvements via software changes in the past, this is the first time it’s offering up such a tweak as an Easter egg, which means owners will have to figure out how to unlock the hidden feature before they can use it.
Other Tesla Easter eggs include a mode that turns the in-car display into a James Bond-themed console from the Lotus submarine car used in The Spy Who Loved Me. You unlock this by keying “007” into the car’s service console login.
There’s no word yet on how the new speed improvements will be unlocked when they roll out via an update in December, but it likely won’t take long for intrepid and enthusiastic P100D owners to find out once it’s available.

Internet giant Baidu is fast-forwarding its own self-driving car tests with a new public trial of autonomous vehicles, including cars supplied by Chinese automakers BYD, Chery and BAIC. The public tests opened for passengers on Tuesday, and have ferried around 200 people, as of today, across a 3.16 km (around 2 miles) stretch of road in tourist destination Wuzhen, which has been “mapped with centimetre accuracy,” according to Baidu.
The driverless vehicles are equipped with Velodyne LiDAR, video cameras, millimeter wave radar and a computer brain to make sense of all that data developed by Baidu in-house and installed in the trunk. The cars switch lanes, negotiate intersections, pass slower cars and even make U-turns, achieving a max top speed of 60 km per hour (37 mph) in accordance with the local speed limit.
There is a driver present in case of a need to take over control, but they don’t have their hands on the wheel throughout the trip unless necessary, according to Baidu. A display within the car shows passengers info, including traffic conditions and objects along the path.
Baidu’s targeting 2018 for the first production commercial vehicles on the road using this tech in a non-test capacity, with a broader rollout, including mass production, targeted for 2021. The company has made good progress on that road to date, given that it only began its autonomous driving business unit in earnest back in December 2015, though it had clearly been working on the project for some time since it also announced a successful test of automated driving tech in Beijing at that time.
Baidu also recently began testing its vehicles in California, after receiving a permit for autonomous testing from the state DMV earlier this year.

747,NextEV isn’t giving up on auto ownership,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/16/nextev-isnt-giving-up-on-auto-ownership/,2016/11/16,"
Padmasree Warrior, CEO of NextEV, took the stage at the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show to make a case for car 3.0. Noting the car of the future is likely to be electric and connected is not radical, but Warrior’s assertion that individual ownership of cars is not going to completely go away is less commonly heard at tech and auto events anymore.
The cutting edge of automotive technology and predictions is leaning toward the shared economy overtaking personal ownership of vehicles in the near future. Large manufacturers like Ford are preparing themselves for it, as are newer companies like Uber, Lyft, ReachNow, Car2Go and many others.
But as Warrior pointed out, “Mobility is a symbol of freedom.” Americans now spend 30 percent of their income on owning cars, and in India and China, households spend more than 100 percent of their income on cars. It’s often the first thing people buy when they get a job, she said, because “car ownership is aspirational.”
NextEV asked potential customers what premium meant to them in this future car. It didn’t mean leather seats or more buttons on the center console; the company found that premium meant getting back their time.
In addition to the environmental benefits of driving an emissions-free electric car in a large city, the car will learn your normal routine, your favorite settings and your most frequent errands. It will take over what tasks it can (someday, possibly all of them), freeing you to think about or do other things. Many cars and navigation systems can already save time during the commute wherever possible; Warrior says they will only get better at it without merely replicating apps on our smartphones.
“Car 3.0 will be the smartest device you own in the next few years,” Warrior predicted. “[It] will be a robot that looks like a high-performance car.”

Every automaker seems to be partnering up for car sharing, and Hyundai is no exception. The carmaker is teaming up with WaiveCar, a startup offering ad-supported car sharing with a pilot program currently operating in Santa Monica. The team-up will see Hyundai’s first EV, the IONIQ, incorporated into WaiveCar’s fleet, beginning in LA.
Hyundai is offering the IONIQ to WaiveCar users for up to two hours per trip on-demand for free, with ads displayed on the car’s body and on a roof-mounted display as a way to recoup the costs of driving for WaiveCar. WaiveCar’s top-taunted displays have their own built-in 4G data connection, and change the advertising they show to onlookers based on where the car is traveling and the time of day. After the initial two-hour period, the car can be kept for an additional $5.99 per hour, or returned to a designated WaiveCar drop-off point.
For Hyundai, it’s a double-dip marketing campaign: the cars display IONIQ advertising, and they also offer drivers a chance to take one for a spin totally free of charge, with fewer restrictions and more real-world use opportunity than if they’d come into a dealership for a test drive. To start, Hyundai is deploying 150 cars for use with WaiveCar, with availability beginning in early 2017.
It’s a smart partnership for Hyundai and WaiveCar both, as it gives the former a car-sharing partner with a unique model that’s a great fit for promoting its EV strategy, and the latter a steady inventory supply with vehicles that are less expensive to maintain than fuel-based cars. Show-rooming vehicles (giving users a chance to see what ownership would be like) is part of every automaker’s strategy with car-sharing services and partnerships, but this one, given the market and the EV angle, seems particularly apt.

750,LeEco secures $600M in fresh funding as financial issues reportedly halt electric car project,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/16/leeco-funding/,2016/11/16,"
There’s good news and bad news for LeEco, the ambitious Chinese tech company that is working on electric cars, smartphones, smart TVs and more.
Fresh from the leaking of an internal letter from billionaire CEO Yueting Jia which cautioned against its rapid international expansion, the company has landed $600 million in fresh funding. At the same time, however, the brakes have apparently been hit on its electric vehicle project in the U.S.
LeShi, LeEco’s Chinese parent company, raised the new cash from more than 10 Chinese companies, Reuters first reported. A spokesperson declined to name the investors specifically, but did tell TechCrunch that the backers are all Jia’s classmates from Beijing-based Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business.
Jia wrote to the company’s 10,000-plus staff earlier this month warning that the company’s growth on multiple new projects was unsustainable. LeEco began in smart TVs and a Netflix-like service, but it has fanned out into commerce, smartphones and an electric car project with U.S.-based Faraday Future.
The letter was assumed by many to mean that LeEco’s U.S. operations and the electric car project that it is working on with Faraday Future are in jeopardy. However, speaking at the TechCrunch Beijing event last week, LeEco’s North American operations lead Brian Hui denied that his business would be impacted. He also stressed that the development of the car is the firm’s “highest priority” and will continue. Hui did admit that LeEco is entering a new phase of its business which, among other things, will mean fewer large scale investments like the recent $2 billion acquisition of Vizio.
The commitment of new financing looks to have come at just the right time with reports suggesting that LeEco and Faraday Future are desperately in need of money for the car project, which is aimed at toppling Tesla.
Jalopnik reported that work on the duo’s proposed $1.8 billion manufacturing plant in Nevada has paused, while it is apparently behind on payments to its construction firm.
LeEco did not comment on the current situation of the factory when we asked. Reuters reported that the initial $300 million in capital will arrive before the end of November, wherein it will go towards the Faraday Future partnership and the fledgling LeMall business in the U.S., an e-commerce platform for selling LeEco’s hardware.

751,Intel announces $250 million for autonomous driving tech,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/15/intel-announces-250-million-for-autonomous-driving-tech/,2016/11/15,"
When Intel decided to take a crack at its first keynote at an automotive event, it swung for the fences. The company’s CEO, Brian Krzanich, took the stage at the Los Angeles Auto Show‘s Automobility event this morning to announce that Intel Capital would be investing $250 million in autonomous driving over the next two years.
Technologies that will benefit from the investment include connectivity, context awareness, deep learning and security. The goal of autonomous cars is to improve safety by removing as much human error as possible, which requires the vehicles and their data to be safe and reliable.
Intel’s processing power itself comes into play with the amount of data required for autonomous driving. Krzanich pointed out that cars are already equipped with a variety of sensors, cameras and controllers that create, gather and transmit data. He said the automotive industry needs to be prepared for 4 terabytes of data being generated by every car every day.
The fact that Intel chose to make this announcement at the LA Auto Show’s press days highlights the massive crossover that’s happening between technology and transportation. Representatives of every major car manufacturer were at CES 2016, one of the biggest shows for consumer electronics. The North American Auto Show will debut Automobili-D, its tech-focused event in January 2017. And this is the first year of Automobility, the rebranded tech event at the LA Auto Show.
As cars become devices that we drive (or not) and devices become more integrated with our transportation experience across modes, including bike sharing and public transit, cross-pollination between tech companies and auto manufacturers is becoming more than the norm — it’s becoming a necessity.

752,Jaguar’s first electric SUV aims for 80% charge in 90 minutes,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/15/jaguars-first-electric-suv-aims-for-80-charge-in-90-minutes/,2016/11/15,"
Jaguar’s showing off the I-PACE, an electric concept SUV that it’s aiming to bring to production sometime in 2018. The I-PACE looks like a sensible small utility vehicle, with a five-door design and performance-tuned features including a target 0-60mph time of “around” four seconds, a 310+ mile range and a 50kW DC charging mechanism that helps it reclaim 80 percent of its total range capability from zero in just 90 minutes.
The I-PACE looks similar in dimensions to the Tesla Model X, with a broad rear-end designed for max boot space tapering to a slim and sleek rounded front. The idea was to make a car designed for sport-loving drivers, with a low, road-hugging cockpit and yet with tons of usable space for those in the family way.
I don’t understand why car companies can’t name their all-electric concepts without invoking all-caps, dashes or isolated letters, but the I-PACE does look like an intriguing machines, especially if it actually makes it to production in 2018. Besides the exterior design, which I think succeeds in being attractive as well as properly engineered for electric efficiency, I also like the cockpit concept, which uses two large touch screens combines with a digital instrument cluster display to create what Jaguar called a “flightdeck” for the driver.

The full length glass roof is also signature futuristic indulgence, which is not to say it’s unwelcome, but ultimately it’s a mighty nice looking vehicle in large part because it’s such a departure from Jaguar’s existing lineup in terms of design language.
Concept cars are still only that, of course, and a lot can happen between conception and production, but Jaguar definitely looks to be rolling in the right direction with its all-electric debut.

753,Nexar’s vehicle-to-vehicle network will use dash cam AI to prevent accidents,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/15/nexars-vehicle-to-vehicle-network-will-use-dash-cam-ai-to-prevent-accidents/,2016/11/15,"
Cars are on their way to pooling their collective smarts, but vehicles that have built-in communication tech and intelligence processing are still a ways off for many. Nexar is a startup hoping to make collective collision avoidance a more achievable reality in the short-term, using their Ai-based dash cam app.
Nexar’s app is available for iOS and Android, and uses your phone’s camera to monitor the road ahead as you drive, recording events when it detects danger using its artificial intelligence engine. The video of the event is then automatically uploaded to the cloud for later reference, and the phone also logs sensor data to help recreate a simulation of what happened to your vehicle at the moment of the incident.
Starting today, the app will also start providing crowdsourced data to help predict and prevent collisions, by sharing that info among users of its app, starting in San Francisco and New York first. The idea it to provide real-time warnings about potential collisions using just the smartphone itself, building a road map that can be shared across its pool of users.
Using data collected by individual instances of the app about accidents, Nexar’s network will use real-time interpretation of the data to try to anticipate the best way to minimize the impact of these accidents and alert other drivers on the network before they also become involved. If you think about multi-car pileups, often the issue is that cars involved later in the process just don’t have the information they need quickly enough to avoid being caught up.
Waze provides similar crowdsourced warnings about upcoming traffic obstructions and collisions to watch out for, but Nexar’s use of video analysis and machine learning applied to computer vision could help it be more responsive in real-time to incidents that pose an immediate threat.

Level 5 self-driving tech is the highest variety, which aims for fully autonomous vehicles with no need of human steering mechanisms. AdasWorks, a Budapest-based startup launched in 2015, is charing its name to AImotive and expanding to a new U.S.-based Mountain View office to further its efforts in making Level 5 autonomy a lived reality for people and cars.
AImotive’s goal is to offer a full suite of self-driving enabling technologies to carmakers, via its full-stack aiDrive offering, which includes a number of AI-powered engines for learning to identify different objects organized by class, landmark-based location recognition, real-time object tracking and control of not only gas and brake, but other car features including headlights and horn. AImotive also offers aiKit, which covers collection, simulation and data testing; and aiWare, the hardware designed for use in vehicles, provided embedded computing for advanced neural networks used to drive its AI.
AImotive’s aim is to provide scalable Level 5 autonomy to carmakers regardless of chips used, with technology that can truly work at the global level, across different geographies, climates, environmental conditions and cultures. Its team of 120 is primarily “researchers and developers,” founder Laszlo Kishonti said in a press release, and its tech is designed to apply AI research to help self-driving cars adapt to different driving styles across the world in real-time.
AImotive has raised $10.5 million in funding to date across a seed and Series A round, from investors including Robert Bosch Venture Capital, Draper Associates, Nvidia and more.

755,China’s Didi partners with car rental giant Avis ahead of planned global expansion,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/15/didi-chuxing-avis/,2016/11/15,"
China’s Didi Chuxing revealed last month that it has plans to expand into global markets, and today we got the first hint of what that might look like after the Uber rival announced a tie-in with U.S. car rental giant Avis.
The partnership will see Avis introduce an option for booking cars overseas — in 175 countries, to be precise — inside the Didi app. The option is strictly for booking rental cars, not chauffeured cars or taxis. The upshot is that Chinese tourists who are traveling abroad get a fairly convenient way to plan their travel once they land and before they jet off, assuming that they want their own four-wheels.
TechCrunch understands that the initial integration will go live in early 2017 ahead of Chinese New Year at the end of January. (That makes sense since many Chinese travel overseas for the holiday period.) Further down the line, Didi may increase its integration with Avis to allow users to book cars — and potentially more — on the ground once overseas.
This isn’t a spectacular, fireworks-filled first push overseas, but it is a move that could play a part in helping Didi to identify countries where its users are particularly keen to manage their transportation options, and thus markets where the company could expand its services organically. Yes, Didi does have investments in Uber rivals in the U.S. (Lyft), India (Ola) and Southeast Asia (Grab), but it has said that its global expansion could come in the form of starting its own operations or buying local services. There’s no word on when the global expansion may come, for that matter.
Perhaps interesting to note, Didi confirmed to us that this “strategic partnership” does not include any investment on either side. Had that not been the case, it might have been telling of Didi’s global plans, but it isn’t.

Electric cars and hybrid vehicles can be incredibly quiet – so quiet that a populace used to cars that make noise can be hurt when sharing space with them. New NHTSA standards for automakers aim to help fix that with audible alerts hat are required on all new hybrid and electric going forward beginning September 1, 2019.
The new sound requirements applies across the U.S., and should help prevent as many as 2,400 pedestrian injuries each year once they span the range of EVs and hybrids on the road. The new rule specifically states than all-electric and hybrid cars that have four wheels and weigh under 10,000 pounds must make an audible noise when traveling either backwards or forwards at speeds up of to 19 miles per hour. Beyond that, NHTSA says a nose isn’t required, because tires and wind provide enough.
The rule comes fully into effect at the beginning of September 2019, as mentioned, but half of all new electric and hybrids made must comply a year prior to that, by September 1, 2018. This could impact a significantly larger portion of vehicles by then, given the current vehicle roadmaps of the various automakers, which are looking forward to adding many more electric cars to their lineups.

758,Samsung is buying Harman for $8B to further its connected car push,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/13/samsung-harman/,2016/11/13,"
Samsung is increasing its focus on the connected car after the Korean firm announced plans to buy auto and audio product maker Harman in an all cash deal worth $8 billion.
You may best associate the name with audio equipment, but Harman is big on cars, too. The acquisition is Samsung’s largest to date and a big deal for its automotive ambitions. Around 65 percent of Harman’s sales — which totaled $7 billion over the last year — were for car-related products. Samsung added that Harman products, which included connected car devices and audio systems, are installed in an estimated 30 million vehicles worldwide.
Samsung lags Google and Apple on in-car entertainment and software systems (Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, respectively) so this deal will give it the kind of reach that could allow it to compete more evenly with its rivals inside the car.
“Harman perfectly complements Samsung in terms of technologies, products and solutions, and joining forces is a natural extension of the automotive strategy we have been pursuing for some time,” Oh-Hyun Kwon, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Samsung Electronics, said in a statement.
Terms of the deal will see Samsung pay $112.00 per share. That’s a healthy premium on Harman’s current share price of $87.65, and it gives the deal a total value of approximately $8 billion. The transaction is expected to close by mid-2017, at which time Harman will become a standalone subsidiary of Samsung. Dinesh Paliwal will continue to lead the firm as its Chairman, President and CEO, both Harman and Samsung said.
“Samsung is an ideal partner for Harman and this transaction will provide tremendous benefits to our automotive customers and consumers around the world,” Paliwal added via canned comment.
With Google rapidly advancing its automotive technology and Apple reportedly developing an electric vehicle (or not), it is perhaps not surprising that Samsung has made ground on automotive itself in 2016.
This summer, it invested $450 million into China-based electric car maker BYD, which includes Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. among its investor base. Other reports suggested that the Korean giant was also eyeing up a bid for Magneti Marelli, a manufacturing subsidiary of Fiat Chrysler.
This investment will go beyond automotive, though, according to Samsung. The firm said it plans to marry its own electronics division and expertise with that of Harman for audio — both on the consumer and professional side of business — and connected devices, aka the internet of things, or IOT for short.
IOT is still very much a buzzword, but Samsung said it plans to utilize Harman’s 8,000 developers to “deliver the next generation of cloud-based consumer and enterprise experiences, as well as end-to-end services for the automotive market through the convergence of design, data and devices.”
Other notable acquisitions from Samsung of late include Viv, a highly regarded virtual assistant from the creators of Apple’s Siri service, and cloud computing company Joyent.

Hyperloop One and the United Arab Emirates are on the fast track to building out the first hyperloop system. Just today H1 announced it would build the first commercial hyperloop transportation system from Dubai to Abu Dhabi.
The journey is 99 miles (159.4 km) long and normally takes about two hours by car but H1 promises it would take a mere 12 minutes in the hyperloop.
H1 is partnering with the Dubai Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) to evaluate the feasibility of building this system in greater Dubai and the UAE and the announcement follows the next stage of development for the company, which is gearing up for its “Kitty Hawk” moment early next year when H1 will test a full-scale prototype of its system in the Nevada desert.
It’s also part of the company’s next stage of progress in Dubai. Last August H1 co-founder Shervin Pishevar hinted the first hyperloop would be built overseas and the company announced in October it received $50 million in funding from DP World Group of Dubai, the third-largest ports operator in the world, to build a hyperloop system to move cargo throughout the country and the world.
On top of the news, H1 revealed an original design concept for the portals and pods that would take passengers from Dubai to Abu Dhabi in H1’s autonomous transportation system.
Hyperloop One will work with McKinsey and architecture and engineering firm BIG to evaluate the concept of a build out for a passenger system in the UAE.
You can see what H1 has dreamed up in the video below:

760,The insurance impact of self-driving cars and shared mobility,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/08/the-insurance-impact-of-self-driving-cars-and-shared-mobility/,2016/11/08,"




Seth Birnbaum
Contributor


Seth Birnbaum is the CEO and co-founder of EverQuote, the largest online auto insurance marketplace in the U.S.


“We’re going to see more change in the next five to 10 years than we’ve seen in the last 50,” said Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors, on record. While that statement is now a year old, it continues to ring true. Vehicle ownership is changing and self-driving cars will be implemented in the next decade. What will affect the insurance industry more: self-driving cars or shared mobility?
Self-driving cars
One of Google’s self-driving cars recently was involved in one of the most damaging driverless car collisions yet. It wasn’t the autonomous car’s fault when a driver ran a red light and collided with the side of the vehicle, causing the airbags to deploy, but it was a scenario the car did not know how to avoid.
The driver took over and applied the brakes, but it was too late to prevent a collision.
While self-driving cars will likely be much safer than human-driven vehicles once they’re widely adopted, will they really be safer when there are still people driving on the road? How do you account for the complex and elusive “human element”?
Which leads us to the question: What happens when insurance is brought into the picture? The traffic light was green for six seconds before the self-driving car pulled through — and it was still hit.
The self-driving car industry is expected to grow exponentially over the next 20 years, and insurers will have to learn to swim — or sink.
Auto insurance will have to adapt to this impending technology in the immediate future, as well as in the long term. While self-driving cars are expected to reduce accidents by 90 percent, 81 percent of Americans feel they are safer driving themselves. If they feel that way, will drivers be willing to pay more for the technology? Volvo recently stated that their autonomous car technology will likely add $10,000 to the car’s cost.
With consumer hesitation and other legal barriers, it may take decades before self-driving cars are fully adopted. As a result, there will likely be a more immediate, transitional period that insurers will need to plan for — a period where both self-driving vehicles and human-driven vehicles are on the road.
A car driving itself changes a lot more for insurers than does multiple drivers using the same vehicle.
As self-driving cars are released to the public, there may be accidents involving that “human element” as the public adapts to the technology. Insurers will have to cover these types of collisions — perhaps, ones similar to Google’s self-driving car accident — in the short term. In the future, there also will be new risks to insure, such as sensor damage, satellite failure and other new technology.
Perhaps, insurance will take on a no-fault form, in which neither party is at fault, and each car owner’s insurance covers their own vehicle. Or insurance could become similar to utility cost with a premium cost based on mileage or usage. There also may be risks involving driverless-car hacks and cybersecurity. Will insurers cover cybersecurity issues or will the manufacturer?
The answers to these questions can’t all be determined now, but insurers will have to react to this paradigm shift sooner rather than later. Comprehensive coverage for fires, animals, floods, theft, earthquakes and vandalism will still be necessary, and that type of insurance will not need to change very much, except for replacement cost adjustments.
Infrastructure is also expected to change as self-driving cars become readily available, and this could impact the way that insurance operates, as well. Currently, not all roads are smoothly paved with clean, visible road lines. What about snow and other weather conditions? How long will it take before self-driving cars can drive everywhere and not only on perfectly lined, mapped roads? Self-driving cars still have a long way to go before they’re fully autonomous at SAE Level 5, but once there — if the safety claims are true — insurance costs will likely decrease for both drivers and providers.
Shared mobility
Cars are parked 95 percent of the time. For that reason, and because of convenience, ridesharing services have exploded in recent years, resulting in a very profitable and innovative industry. Uber is currently valued at nearly $63 billion and Lyft has seen recent record growth. Shared mobility of cars is expected to continue expanding in the coming years through ridesharing services, but also through carsharing.
Carsharing, in which multiple drivers have access to the same vehicle, will likely grow in popularity in the coming years. Services, like Maven or Zipcar, that connect drivers to available vehicles will continue expanding because of increased competition and economic scale. As shared mobility is offered in more locations with focused customer segments, more transportation needs will be met. Over time, households may have less of a need for car ownership; as a result, multi-vehicle households may become single-vehicle households. Eventually, people may decide not to own a vehicle at all.

While shared mobility will likely overlap with self-driving cars at some point, it may affect the insurance industry in different ways as car ownership changes.
Shared mobility will have a more immediate impact on the insurance industry. Cars will wear down faster with more frequent use, and there may be more accidents with multiple drivers. Insurers will need to adapt to covering multiple drivers who may not be in the same household or family, and who may not always be driving the same vehicle.
As a result, coverage will likely become more focused on driving habits with usage-based insurance (pay how you drive) or become more centered on a pay-per-mile basis. Companies like MetroMile are already using this model, and it will likely grow in popularity as carsharing does. Instead of paying for insurance even while your car is parked, you pay based on the miles you drive.
Insurance tech will also play a role with shared mobility as telematics devices can more accurately measure in real time who is driving the vehicle and how safe a driver they are.
Self-driving cars or shared mobility?
While shared mobility will have a more immediate impact on the insurance industry, self-driving cars will certainly impact the insurance industry more overall. A car driving itself changes a lot more for insurers than does multiple drivers using the same vehicle.
That said, the two sectors will overlap at some point in time. Self-driving features will continue to be incorporated in ridesharing, and will eventually be implemented in the carsharing industry. At that point, the two sectors will collide as insurance continues to adapt to new developing risks. Self-driving cars and shared mobility will both be disruptive for the industry — it’s only a matter of time.

761,Tesla acquires Grohmann engineering to boost production,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/08/tesla-acquires-grohmann-engineering-to-boost-production/,2016/11/08,"
Tesla just announced that it will acquire Germany’s Grohmann Engineering, in a deal that will see the global engineering leader become Tesla’s new Advanced Automation facility based in Germany, a new subdivision of the automaker dedicated to helping Tesla increase the automation and effectiveness of its manufacturing process.
“This will really be our first acquisition of significance in our whole history,” explained Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk on a call discussing the news, noting that Grohmann was their “first choice” in terms of bringing on expertise to help it “build the machines that build the machine.”
Tesla expects this to help drive “exponential improvements” in its production process, in terms of both speed and quality of output, while cutting the cost-per-vehicle at the same time. The new facility will also grow its engineering workforce considerably in the next two years, with a target of adding more than 1,000 jobs throughout Tesla’s new Advanced Automation division in both engineering and skilled technician roles. Grohmann currently employs around 700 people, including hardware and software engineers.
“We thought it was important that Tesla become, in part, a German company,” Musk said, regarding the investment in the country. “That’s what this was all about.”
Tesla CTO JB Straubel explained that Tesla has been working with Grohmann in a partnership for the past few months, and found that the teams complemented each other well and were achieving a lot in terms of automation improvements, and determined they could do even more as a combined company. Both Musk and Grohmann founder Klaus Grohmann also expressed deep mutual respect for each other’s companies because of their similar foundational stories.
This new acquisition represents a significant investment in Tesla’s production processes at a very fundamental level, similar to some of the company’s moves to take ownership of other aspects of its business at a more basic level, including with the new inverter used in its Powerwall 2 home storage battery, and with the software used in its forthcoming self-driving technology.
Musk has previously identified production as a key area of personal focus in terms of driving improvement. He noted that he has camped out in the past to help facilitate production rate improvements that helped Tesla meet its vehicle output goal of 2,000 cars per week, and has also identified production rate limits as a key area for improvement the company is pursuing in its home energy business.
In a blog post detailing the news, Tesla noted that it’s already been able to boost production by 400 percent over four years, and it expects to be able to drive that up further as a result of this new acquisition. Tesla is anticipating that the deal will close by early 2017, once it receives clearance from German regulators. Tesla did not disclose the financial terms of the deal.

NXP Semiconductor, which made headlines recently after entering into an agreement to be acquired by Qualcomm, unveiled a series of new products today that make it clear why they were a high-value target for the mobile chip giant. Each of three new products NXP announced today promises to advance tech related to self-driving vehicles.
In the autonomous car market, NXP revealed a new microcontroller product for use with vehicle radar that will supply four times more computing power to these systems, which will lead to better performance and higher accuracy for radar detection features, which include automatic braking, lane change and cruise assist. NXP also says this will help considerably improve the speed of detection and tracking of objects that might get in an autonomous vehicle’s path, including pedestrians and bikes. The new micro controller is already in testing with some of NXP’s top customers, and will hit wide availability later in 2017.
The second new product is a trucking solution developed in partnership with DAF Trucks, Honda and Siemens, which uses vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication to improve reaction time for connected autonomous truck platoons to achieve 30 times faster reaction time when compared to human-controlled vehicles by 2017. This would allow trucking companies to operate convoys of transport trucks with much higher efficiency when compared to similar arrangements that rely on human reaction time to do things like keep distance, and deal with unexpected events like personal vehicles cutting in between members of the convoy.
NXP and Cohda Wireless are teaming up for NXP’s third product announcement. The new partnership will let NXP make use of Cohda’s V2X development algorithms, which will make it a lot easier for customers of both companies to use their technologies together to build in smart decision-making systems that involve culling data from infrastructure like traffic lights, radar detection and other vehicles around them, for instance.
As we suspected, it looks like NXP will continue to act as an industry leader in autonomous driving tech under Qualcomm, which should definitely help it return value for its new owner.

763,"Oryx nano antennas allow autonomous cars to see farther, better",https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/07/oryx-nano-antennas-allow-autonomous-cars-to-see-farther-better/,2016/11/07,"
Oryx Vision has created a “coherent optical radar system,” according to CEO Rani Wellingstein, that improves the depth perception of autonomous vehicles. The Israel-based company has emerged from stealth after Series A fundraising and is positioning itself as a competitor to lidar systems.
Wellingstein pointed out that traditional lidar detects light with photoelectric sensors, “basically measuring the energy of the light.” But Oryx Vision uses what the company describes as nano antennas that are detecting with an electromagnetic wave, which allows the system to access additional information.
The advantage is increased range and sensitivity for an autonomous vehicle that needs to know exactly what is surrounding it and what those things are doing. The Oryx antenna operates at a 10-micron wavelength that can see through fog and, unlike lidar, not get blinded by bright sunlight.
Oryx engineers began working about six years ago to build a device that could surpass some of lidar’s shortcomings. It took a year and a half just to get the prototype to the point of being a usable, reliable array that can actually be used for imaging.
Oryx says its antennas are also less expensive than the lidar systems being used in cutting-edge autonomous vehicles now. The cost of the imager the system uses is about the same as the camera in a mobile phone, and the company is using “the cheapest, most boring laser on earth,” Wellingstein said in a phone interview. The system uses very simple optics, so there’s no steering, no rotating elements and no optical rays to account for.
Oryx has 20 people in the company so far, but now that financing is finalized, Oryx plans to hire more talent in Israel, Silicon Valley and Germany, and maybe elsewhere, depending on the demand from auto manufacturers and autonomous vehicle disruptors, Wellingstein said. The company is targeting companies that are building fully autonomous vehicles of the near future rather than the advanced driver assistance systems we’re seeing in cars today.
“A lot of the most ambitious players are retreating from these spaces — Apple, Google,” Wellingstein said. “We think the technology aspect is still not there. Autonomous driving is about vision and decision, and there’s currently a gap between the two. There must be another technology, another sensor [besides lidar], to close that gap. Most of the players we’re talking to are not aware there is another technology. That is where we are.”

The race for self-driving autos is heating up; undercover startup Zoox is fetching a value of $1.5 billion even before unveiling their first product.
TechCrunch has confirmed that the company recently raised $50 million from Hong Kong-based hedge fund Composite Capital. The round was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and comes just months after $200 million in funding raised at a $1 billion valuation. 
Zoox does not have plans to sell the cars directly to consumers, but instead plans to create a service to rival Uber. They haven’t announced specific timetables for its release, but have referred to it as a “five-year vehicle development program.”
The startup was formed by Jesse Levinson, a leader in Stanford’s self-driving car group, and Tim Kentley-Klay, an Australian entrepreneur. Zoox formed less than two years ago, but the Menlo Park-based startup has already hired more than 100 employees, some from companies like Tesla, Alphabet and Apple.
General Motors’ $1 billion acquisition of Cruise Automation earlier this year helped raise the valuations of auto startups. Sources tell TechCrunch that traditional automakers are considering buying more startups.
Uber has already begun testing its self-driving service in Pittsburgh. The company also recently purchased Otto, to add to its autonomous fleet. 
But these vehicles are still highly regulated; Comma.ai recently threw in the towel amid much frustration. 
Zoox previously raised funding from DFJ, Lux Capital and Blackbird Ventures.

It’s taken a while, but the company today launched an update to the Android Auto app for — well — Android that makes good on this promise. Even if your car isn’t Android Auto compatible, you can now get all the benefits of Android Auto without the cost of a new mid-size sedan.
So what’s the point of that? Android Auto on the phone provides you with a simplified interface that combines directions, music, and incoming messages into a relatively distraction free experience. That’s essentially the same interface you would see on an in-car display with Android Auto support. Android Auto works with popular apps like Spotify, Pandora, Google Maps and others.
Like all things Google, the app will also soon let you use “Ok Google” commands to use directions, send messages and control your music.
One smart thing Google has done here is given users the ability to automatically start the app when the phone is paired with your car’s Bluetooth network.
The Android Auto app is compatible with any phone that runs Android 5.0 and newer. Google says the update will roll out to users in more than 30 countries over the course of the next few days, so if you don’t see it yet, don’t despair and buy an Audi A6 just so you don’t feel left out.

766,Tesla to charge new owners for Supercharger use after around 1K miles,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/07/tesla-to-charge-new-owners-for-supercharger-use-after-around-1k-miles/,2016/11/07,"
Tesla’s network of Superchargers have so far offered free, unlimited use to drivers of Tesla vehicles, but that was never going to last forever. Tesla announced upcoming changes to the Supercharger program today, which will introduce a fee for owners who purchase their vehicle after January 1, 2017 – but only if they exceed 400 kWh of charging in a year, which translates to roughly 1,000 miles of driving.
Once that threshold is passed, Tesla owners will begin being charged an incremental fee depending on usage, but one that will still undershoot the price of filling up a fuel-based car’s gas tank. As mentioned, orders until January 1, 2017 and existing owners and orders aren’t affected – they still get free Supercharging for the life of their vehicle, provided they take delivery before April 1, 2017.
Tesla says the change is about adjusting the economics of Supercharging in a way that “allows us to reinvest in the network, accelerate its growth,” but also notes that while they will begin charging customers after a certain point, the “Supercharger Network will never be a profit center,” which implies all funds generated will go to maintenance and expansion/improvement of the resource for drivers.
The timelines for the changes to come into effect mean that any Model 3 owners will have the capped Supercharging plan, and Tesla isn’t yet revealing the specifics of its usage-based pricing. That effective 1,000 mile cap means that the needs of many, many drivers will be met before they hit that Supercharge limit, however, since this really only impacts those using their cars for trips outside the car’s considerable range when they don’t have time or inclination to stop and charge at a normal rate.
Tesla also says it’ll release further details of how the pricing for charging beyond 400 kWh will work later this year, but also notes that these details may vary over time and by region, depending on the price of electricity and other factors.
We always knew the unlimited free Supercharger program couldn’t last forever. At least legacy Tesla owners will at least be able to find some comfort over not getting hardware needed for self-driving in their cars with the knowledge that they can at least use Superchargers indefinitely.

National U.S. Privacy Laws Are Needed




Ford, GM, Toyota and VW are just a handful of the car manufacturers planning to put self-driving cars on the road in the next five years. If you ask Uber or Tesla, they might say driverless cars have already arrived… which means we’re running out of time to secure one of the juiciest new targets for hackers.
Hacking a car is easy. Just ask Tesla, Jeep or Mitsubishi. As self-driving cars reach the masses, they’ll dramatically raise the stakes for cybersecurity. If your computer gets hacked, it can be costly. If your car gets hacked, it can be deadly.
The Department of Transportation’s (DoT) recent guidance on self-driving cars is a good start in addressing cybersecurity, but leaves a lot to be desired. Granted, the DoT does admit its lack of technical expertise, and requests special hiring tools to attract security experts who can best vet this new technology.
But we can’t afford to wait long for stricter rules. The current language — words like “best practices,” “guidance” and “should” — leaves room for wide interpretation that could leave cars vulnerable. Here’s how the DoT can take a page from other industries and keep drivers safe without slowing the advance of self-driving technology.
Why we need stronger cybersecurity rules for driverless cars
Security policies often lag behind rapidly evolving technologies, many of which are built on well-known or open systems with standard programming and networking, leaving wide open doors for hackers. Self-driving cars fall into this category, and the software behind them makes it dramatically easier for everyone from common criminals to terrorists to infiltrate and take control of a vehicle.
Now would be a fantastic time for the government to sound relevant on cybersecurity, after the NSA breach, DNC hacks and other embarrassments have shown its inability to defend against state-sponsored attacks. Stronger rules would restore some confidence in a car industry that doesn’t exactly have a spotless record of doing the right thing. From ignition switches to airbags, there have been egregious product quality issues where manufacturers have put economic interests before passenger safety.
These tough questions around self-driving cars will have to be answered sooner rather than later.
Imagine what would happen if a terrorist, a hacktivist or even a common criminal took control of an autonomous car. They suddenly have a two-ton projectile that puts hundreds of lives at risk. Imagine the next evolution of ransomware, when a hacker takes control of your vehicle and will only relinquish control if you pay up. Not to mention the potential privacy implications if someone could remotely monitor conversations, driving habits and other information gathered by vehicles.
What the DoT rules should include
When it comes to public safety, “best practices” aren’t going to cut it. What we need are policies and testing that ensure the computer systems and software onboard self-driving cars are secure and robust enough to prevent today’s toughest hacks.
Autonomous vehicles should have the same stringent testing standards as in air travel. If you’ve ever seen FAA testing of new airplanes, you know it’s a test of their limits, stretching the wings to their breaking point, hurling ever-larger projectiles at windows and so on. The government should apply the same strict testing to cybersecurity in driverless cars. Put all new vehicles through DDoS attacks and advanced persistent threats to see what they can handle. Challenge hackers to see who can crack the system and where the vulnerabilities lie. With stricter testing, we can assure a safer ride before driverless cars reach the masses.

Here Is How To Address Car Hacking Threats

Once they’re on the road, we need a certification system that requires renewal. Just as cars must go through regular inspections for emissions and mechanical safety, driverless cars should be evaluated for cybersecurity. Once a driverless car is declared secure, it’s going to need continuous updates as the threat landscape changes. Regular check-ins and recertification will ensure that passengers, pedestrians and other cars on the road aren’t at risk because a vehicle didn’t receive its latest patch. Certification should also extend to the vendor community so that those providing technology and services must ensure the same levels of security as manufacturers.
If those requirements aren’t met, the government must hold manufacturers responsible with strong penalties for violations. In the financial services industry, breaches of ethics and other safeguards are met with fines, civil and criminal prosecution and other strong retribution. “Best practices” have no teeth. If the government hopes to regulate driverless cars, it’ll need tough penalties for safety violations, especially for cybersecurity, which is among the most significant vulnerabilities for passengers.
There also are a number of gray areas on which the DoT will have to rule. While the guidance acknowledges the ethical questions, that doesn’t improve the safety of passengers or bystanders. If a driverless car is hacked and hits a pedestrian, who is responsible? The owner? The manufacturer? The passengers? What happens in parking garages, tunnels and other spaces that lack connectivity? These tough questions around self-driving cars will have to be answered sooner rather than later.
How stronger rules can help autonomous vehicles
Some have argued that a lighter regulatory hand at this point in the driverless car evolution is needed — we don’t want to limit innovation or put a brake on progress. To that, I say brakes are a good thing. Would you drive 90 miles per hour if you didn’t have brakes on your car? Probably not. Brakes allow us to move quickly, with the systems in place to slow down when necessary.
The stakes are more extreme than ever before. For most people, the Yahoo data breach isn’t a big deal, apart from the need to change their password and maybe keep an eye on their credit reports. For those who have had their identities stolen or been hit with ransomware, the consequences are steeper and more disruptive. For those riding in a car, a hack could be the difference between life and death.
Autonomous vehicles will likely usher in safer, more convenient and more efficient transportation options… but only if we do everything we can to keep them secure.

768,What Tesla’s new Gigafactory means for electric vehicles,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/06/what-teslas-new-gigafactory-means-for-electric-vehicles/,2016/11/06,"




Jussi Pikkarainen
Contributor


Jussi Pikkarainen is marketing project manager for Skeleton Technologies, a pioneer in the ultracapacitor energy storage industry.


Tesla‘s new Gigafactory opened at the end of July in Nevada, with much excitement from both the media and the general public. Only 14 percent of the massive structure has been built, with the rest of the $5 billion project to be concluded by 2020. According to Tesla, battery cell production will start in 2017; by 2018, the Gigafactory should be cranking out cars to the tune of 500,000 Model 3s per year. A big part of Tesla’s need to build the Gigafactory lies in the reduced expenses for lithium-ion battery production it provides.
The Gigafactory is a marvel of modern production technology, “a machine that builds machines,” as Tesla CEO Elon Musk puts it. In addition to being cool, it offers unprecedented economies of scale for lithium-ion battery production, lowering the price from $190 per kWh in April 2016 to an estimated $130 per kWh once complete. The huge scale of the production, coupled with reduction of waste and a vastly reduced supply chain, provide significant savings and ultimately a 30 percent reduction in battery production costs.
The Gigafactory is a big statement from Musk, and a clear sign that Tesla believes the world is ready for full electrics. But does the world agree? Are lithium-ion batteries the way to go? The total number of cars sold in 2015 was around 72.37 million. Electric vehicles accounted for around 0.8 percent, or 540,000, of that number, a significant step up from about 376,000 EVs sold in 2014, but still less than 1 percent of cars sold worldwide.
As far as Tesla goes, the company sold 50,580 vehicles in 2015, 0.07 percent of all cars sold globally, less than 10 percent of all electric vehicle sales. So, Tesla is winning the publicity battle, but so far it’s the big, traditional car manufacturers such as Renault-Nissan that are winning the zero emissions war. Nissan-Renault, the manufacturer of Nissan LEAF, the most-sold EV in the world, and a slew of other electric vehicles, sold 100,000 EVs between August 2015 and August 2016.
So for now, Tesla has gone all-in for lithium-ion batteries. What other options are there? Brands such as Ford, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Toyota — essentially all the big players on the market — are working mostly on hybrids in addition to their traditional lines of cars. To understand the benefits and downsides of each type of car, let’s first take a closer look at the electric and hybrid vehicles on the market today.
From Prius to Model X
Electric and hybrid cars can be divided into four main groups: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) and Fuel-Cell Electric Vehicles. Each have their advantages and disadvantages, but what’s certain is that each type is a more environmentally friendly choice than a conventional, fossil fuel-powered combustion engine vehicle.
Battery Electric Vehicle (BEVs)
Battery electric cars rely only on the battery pack to power the engine, which means the range is generally fairly limited. The one exception currently is Tesla; their Model S has reached a range of around 270 miles or 430 kilometers — although the numbers Tesla provides must be taken with a grain of salt, because the range depends largely on the size of battery pack you choose, how fast you drive, how cold or warm the weather is, whether you are using air conditioning or not, etc.
As mentioned, no other car manufacturers build only BEVs, but many companies are offering them in addition to their plug-in hybrids and traditional gas- or diesel-powered cars. In addition to Tesla, the best-known examples are the i3 from BMW, the Chevrolet Spark EV, the Mitsubishi i-MiEV and the Nissan LEAF.
The Gigafactory is a big statement from Musk, and a clear sign that Tesla believes the world is ready for full electrics. 
The biggest problem BEVs have is the lack of charging stations, and the time it takes to fully charge the battery pack. Tesla is working on building their Supercharger network to solve the issue, but other car brands are currently not able to use the Supercharger network. Of course, the lack of range only becomes an issue when you need to travel longer distances than a typical daily commute to work and back.
Another hurdle that BEVs need to cross is the high price of purchase. Once again, this is something Tesla is looking to remedy, and a large number of potential buyers are eagerly awaiting the launch of Model 3. However, the Model 3, Tesla’s lowest-priced EV starting at $35 000, is still not an inexpensive car by any means.
Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)
Plug-in hybrids have a conventional gas- or diesel-powered engine in addition to a battery pack. Hybrids are popular because they combine long range and low fuel consumption. PHEVs can be recharged from an outlet and the battery pack can be used for short distances. Once the power runs out, they can be recharged, or the driver can rely on the engine to keep driving. PHEVs are, of course, not as environmentally friendly as full EVs or fuel-cell EVs, but pollute significantly less than traditional cars. BMW i8, Chevy Volt, Toyota Prius Plug-in and Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV are some well-known examples of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles on the market today.
Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs)
Conventional hybrids with gas-powered engines and electric motors are actually not considered “electric vehicles” and cannot be recharged from the power grid. They are powered entirely by a gasoline engine and regenerative braking. The best-known examples of HEVs are Toyota Prius, the first truly successful hybrid, Honda Civic Hybrid, Toyota Camry Hybrid and Ford Escape Hybrid.
Fuel-Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs)
The last option for the green-thinking consumer is the fuel-cell powered FCEV class. Fuel-Cell Electric Vehicles usually operate by converting hydrogen gas into electricity to power an electric motor. The conversion process of hydrogen gas to electricity produces only water and heat, which means the FCEV class is the only class of EVs together with BEVs that can be classified as zero-emissions vehicles.
There’s one major difference between FCEV and BEV vehicles, though, and that is the Achilles’ heel of BEVs: lack of range. FCEVs rival modern gas engines in range and fueling is just as easy, with about five minutes needed to fill the fuel cell.
So why are there not more FCEVs on the road today? The technology is relative new, which means the biggest problem is lack of fueling infrastructure and, of course, as vehicle production numbers are currently low, the price per unit is high. Of the few FCEVs currently on the market, the Hyundai Tucson FCEV is only available for lease, and prices for the most-sold FCEV to date, Toyota Mirai, start at around $58,000. There are also many problems associated with the production and storage of hydrogen, which we’ll dig into a bit later.
What’s holding back electric vehicles?
To give you an idea of the timescales in which the car industry works, consider this: Toyota started development on its FCEV technology in 1992 and started selling the Toyota Mirai in 2015. That’s 23 years. It’s very common for car models to reach an age of 7-8 years before getting a facelift, which might just mean minor changes to the design of the car and possibly some upgrades under the hood.
Now let’s compare that to Tesla. Founded in 2003, Tesla brought its first car, the Roadster, on the market in 2008. Musk has later admitted that the Roadster “was completely unsafe,” it “broke down all the time,” and it “didn’t really work.” Nonetheless, to bring a new car model to the market five years after the company was founded is impressive. Eight years removed from the launch of the Roadster, Tesla has the Model S and the Model X, with Model 3 a few years away.
In the time most car manufacturers make mostly cosmetic changes to existing models that are based on old, proven technology, Tesla brought to market completely new car models with highly complicated, often unproven technology. Without Tesla lighting a fire under the backsides of the more traditional car companies, it’s very likely that electric cars would experience a slower introduction to the market.
Fossil fuels possess energy density capabilities far beyond what batteries can achieve.
But the Tesla engineers can’t solve all the problems of the electric car industry by themselves.
Let’s turn our attention to energy storage, an undervalued industry. There is a lot of talk about renewable energy production, but energy storage is sort of an afterthought to many. If you have ever wondered why renewable energy is not more prevalent despite us possessing the technology to power the world with it, the reason is energy storage.
Wind and sunlight are inherently unstable sources of energy, because the sun doesn’t shine 24 hours a day, nor does the wind howl away at an endless, steady pace. Energy storage devices are needed to balance the times of highs and lows. The small, incremental improvements in battery technology over the last 267 years — since Benjamin Franklin first coined the term “battery” to describe a set of linked capacitors he was using — have not been enough to keep up with the ever-growing global need for energy storage.
The same logic that applies to our homes, factories and shopping centers applies to our cars. Fossil fuels possess energy density capabilities far beyond what batteries can achieve, which means that despite their well-documented drawbacks concerning the environment, gasoline-powered cars will not disappear until energy storage catches up.
For a typical consumer, the jump from a combustion engine to a full electric, or even a hybrid, is a big leap. Even with constant upgrades and advancements in battery technology, lithium-ion batteries are heavy and suffer from capacity deterioration, leading to EV owners having to change the battery packs in their Teslas, or other electric vehicles, within 5-10 years. By Tesla’s own admission, the battery pack capacity starts deteriorating latest at 4-5 years of use, and by the 8th year, the battery pack capacity is expected to have decreased by 30 percent. With range being the top concern for most buyers, that’s cause for worry, especially with the price of a battery pack replacement hovering currently at a minimum of $12,000, according to Tesla, although the talk on the Tesla Motors Club forums circles at much higher numbers: from $25,000-$45,000.
The prices for EVs will decrease as the technologies involved become mainstream and economies of scale come into play with higher production numbers, so the problem we are left with is range. Extending the range requires one of two things: adding more batteries, which makes the car much heavier, or a rapid acceleration in the energy storage capability of lithium-ion batteries.
Adding more batteries is hardly an ideal solution, but can we expect big increases in lithium-ion battery capacity? Current lithium-ion batteries hold more than twice the amount of energy compared to the first Sony-manufactured lithium-ion batteries introduced to the market in 1991. If a doubled capacity in 25 years of constant research is the best the smartest people on the planet can achieve, it’s not realistic to expect huge increases. In fact, the consensus among the research community is that at most a 30 percent increase in energy by weight is possible for lithium-ion batteries. What that means is that lithium-ion batteries will never be the solution electric vehicles need to dethrone the internal combustion engine.
Without Tesla lighting a fire under the backsides of the more traditional car companies, it’s very likely that electric cars would experience a slower introduction to the market.
Knowing that, why in the world would Tesla put all its figurative eggs in the lithium-ion basket? Because lithium-ion batteries are currently the most cost-effective solution to furthering Elon Musk’s Master Plan, Part Deux, the key word being “currently.”
Therefore, Tesla’s gung-ho approach to lithium-ion batteries should not be taken as a statement on the future of electric vehicle energy storage. Tesla is an early adopter, and even more often the inventor of new technologies, and will surely adopt any advantage in energy storage they deem viable enough to improve on the current designs, regardless of the investment made into lithium-ion batteries. Musk himself has predicted that ultracapacitors, not batteries, will be the breakthrough for electric vehicles.
What’s preventing Tesla from using ultracapacitors? Ultracapacitors, or supercapacitors as they are also known, have several advantages over batteries, the incumbent energy storage technology. Ultracapacitors charge and discharge in seconds, have a lifetime up to 500 times that of lithium-ion batteries and are highly reliable. Sounds perfect, right? Well, not quite. Energy density, the one crack in the ultracapacitor armor, is keeping them off car manufacturers’ short list of potential replacements for lithium-ion batteries. They’re perfect for powering start-stop and Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems, but alone they’re not the answer.
The future of electric vehicles
Sooner or later, the reign of lithium-ion batteries will come to an end, because the inherent limitations of lithium-ion batteries mean that better alternatives must emerge. If we circle back to the four types of electric vehicles discussed earlier, only one does not rely on battery technology: the Fuel-Cell Electric Vehicle.
Hydrogen, the fuel used in FCEVs, is an extremely plentiful element, and when pure hydrogen is derived from renewable energy sources, the entire chain of energy production and consumption is free from carbon emissions. There is a group of devoted FCEV believers within the automotive industry; Toyota is perhaps the most enthusiastic among them. Toyota and Honda have been feverishly working on their FCEV models, with the Toyota Mirai and the Honda Clarity both already on the market, to get a head start on other manufacturers, but the competition is getting its act together. Lexus and Audi both debuted their hydrogen concept cars, the LF-LC and the h-tron quattro respectively, at the Detroit Auto Show in January.

At the outset, hydrogen looks like a promising alternative to fuel the future of transportation, but what does Elon Musk think? When asked to comment on FCEVs while visiting the Automotive World News Congress in Detroit in 2015, Musk was, true to his nature, quite direct in his appraisal, calling FCEVs “incredibly dumb.” Musk is not alone in his scathing criticism. Robert Zubrin, the author of Energy Victory, was quoted in the Economist as saying hydrogen is “just about the worst possible vehicle fuel.”
The disdain is easier to understand if we look at the two biggest problems FCEVs face: the production and delivery of large quantities of hydrogen. It’s currently very costly to produce hydrogen, especially carbon-free, and transferring it is equally expensive. Not to mention that the electricity needed to produce hydrogen could be directly used to power electric vehicles already on the market. It’s looking increasingly likely that FCEVs, despite not relying on batteries, are not the answer.
Where are we headed, then? We can already produce the utopian dream of an electric car enthusiast: a zero-emissions electric vehicle that uses a combination of ultracapacitors and batteries. Batteries provide the range, ultracaps the power and regenerative energy — it’s a perfect marriage of slow and fast energy storage. Is it perfect as a car? Not even close. It’s pricey, and either extremely heavy with longish range, or just heavier than an average car, but with a very limited range. In some years, lithium-ion batteries will hit a wall, and we’ll need an alternative energy storage technology. Whether it’s ultracapacitors, hydrogen, methanol, a combination of existing technologies or something completely different, it remains to be seen.
The sad thing is that Tesla is currently the only car manufacturer with the courage (take note Apple) to push the boundaries and make things happen, while other manufacturers seem to be content at developing hybrids and conducting small-scale tests hoping for a miracle. And what makes that even more baffling is that even though Tesla is the one manufacturer making huge investments on the Gigafactory and lithium-ion battery production, if and when the times comes for another technology to overtake batteries, Elon Musk will be there, ready to pounce. Until then, we’re stuck with Tesla. I can live with that — for now.

769,2016 Mercedes-Benz C350e soothes range anxiety,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/03/2016-mercedes-benz-c350e-soothes-range-anxiety/,2016/11/03,"
The 2016 Mercedes-Benz C350e plug-in hybrid sedan is not a Tesla fighter. It’s not even much of a Chevy Volt fighter. It is a very comfortable, very refined plug-in-hybrid mid-range Mercedes. So if that’s your jam, this is your car.
The C350e has a 2-liter gasoline engine and a 60-kW electric motor, for a combined 275 hp and 443 lb-ft of torque, which means quick merging on the freeway. Mercedes is estimating fuel economy to be about 100 mpg, based on European ratings, but there’s no official word from the EPA here in the states yet, where the testing is tougher and the numbers are likely to be lower.
If you want to dip a toe in EV ownership despite your range anxiety, the Mercedes does travel up to 20 miles on electric power only, depending on how you drive. Mash the accelerator, and you’ll drain the battery quickly. The engine will kick in then, and it will run in a more conventional hybrid mode.
The battery fully charges in 2.5 hours at a 240-volt outlet, but it takes 8-plus hours at a regular 120-volt household plug. That’s pretty typical for an electric car, but Mercedes chose to put the plug at the back of the car. That means you either have to back into the garage or parking space or hope that the public charging station has a long enough cord to reach. You can also get quite a bit of energy back from the regen braking system.
This was after ~5 miles of normal driving.
The C350e will only be available (at least at first) in the eight ZEV states that follow California’s lead on zero-emissions rules, including Oregon, where I tested this car. That’s unfortunate, because, it seems to me, people who drive in areas with less EV infrastructure and longer distances between destinations would benefit more from this technology. Use E-mode to run errands in town on electric power only, then use the hybrid mode to drive 200 miles to the next town.
The test vehicle I had was loaded with every bell and whistle: leather upholstery and linden wood trim, head-up display, parking assist, sunroof and even a light fragrance dispersed throughout the cabin. Standard equipment already includes radar-based regenerative braking to recharge the battery, automatic headlights and windshield wipers and collision prevention technology. All told, the price as tested was $61,040.
In related Mercedes news, Daimler AG is bringing its energy storage business to the United States. Mercedes-Benz Energy Americas will develop and sell vehicle-grade lithium-ion batteries for home and business use, similar to Tesla’s Powerwall.

The Obama Administration announced on Thursday that it will create 48 national charging corridors for electric vehicles, covering off 25,000 miles of U.S. highways running through 35 states. The initiative will include a partnership between 28 states, local utilities, EV charging companies and car makers GM, BMW and Nissan.
Reuters reports that the combination of stakeholders is designed to help “jump start” the addition of more EV charging stations into the mix, perhaps accelerating the pace beyond what any individual concern working along would be able to accomplish.
One company that has already been trying to blanket the country in accessible charging stations for electric vehicles is Tesla, which passed the 700 mark for Supercharger sites globally earlier this year. Tesla plans to expand the network even further across the U.S. this year, as you can see from its projected Supercharger location map current as of this writing:
Tesla’s projected Supercharger locations for the end of 2016.
In June, the White House announced the expansion of a federal loan program for promoting EV use to include hardware and software for charging facilities, with a max loan value of $4.5 billion total across the program for energy programs. At that time, the administration announced it was partnering with around 50 stakeholders, including automakers like Tesla, GM, Ford, Nissan, BMW, and Daimler to promote EV charging station creation.

771,"Next-gen Ford driver assist includes auto backup braking, evasive steering help",https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/03/next-gen-ford-driver-assist-includes-auto-backup-braking-evasive-steering-help/,2016/11/03,"
Ford is detailing new features coming to its driver assist system, with a timeframe for arrival in new vehicles within the next two years. The new additions include the ability to detect people and objects on course to pass behind a vehicle, and auto-braking when in reverse if the driver fails to heed warnings about said objects; and another new feature will help human drivers with evasive steering when it’s the only option available to help avoid an accident.
Other new additions include a wide-angle rear camera for a more comprehensive look at what’s behind your car via the in-dash display, and a new parking assistant that can either parallel or perpendicular park (including backing into a spot, a maneuver which I avoid with gusto) with only a single button press required on the part of the driver.
Existing Ford vehicles already offer a range of driver assistance features, of course, including lane keeping and cruise assist, but these new features go beyond what’s already available.
The new features provide the vehicle much more control in case of situations where a driver might not be able to react in time to prevent an accident, going beyond the kind of assistive tech generally available today, which tends to be more about helpful nudging, than really assuming control.

The new cross-traffic braking system will explicitly will act on behalf of the driver in their best interest if a warning goes ignored, actually braking the vehicle in response to a potential collision it predicts in the case of an object crossing a reversing vehicle’s path in situations where a driver couldn’t possibly see the oncoming obstacle.
Ford’s also going to introduce a tech called “evasive steering assist” which will help human drivers steer their cars around stopped or slower vehicles in front, in cases where braking won’t succeed in avoiding a collision and the driver instead attempts to steer around the obstacle. This makes a lot of sense, since drivers often tend to overcorrect in these instances when left to their own devices, leading to problems like ending up in a ditch beyond the shoulder or even rollovers.
The new features, which also include a new wrong way alert system that will provide both audio and visual warnings when a driver starts going the wrong way down a road, are being developed out of Ford’s Research and Innovation Center in Aachen, Germany, and will start seeing real-world road use in the next couple of years, as mentioned.

772,Carrobot joins the aftermarket HUD fray,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/02/carrobot-joins-the-aftermarket-hud-fray/,2016/11/02,"
If you want to add a head-up display (HUD) to your car, you’ve certainly got choices. In addition to Navdy and its Chinese clone Roav, Carrobot launched in October to bring its eye-level interface to cars that don’t have the tech built in.
Carrobot distinguishes itself from its competitors, most notably Navdy and Exploride, by having full voice control for all functions as well as a Bluetooth remote control. All three can handle the expected functions, like GPS navigation, phone calls, messaging, and music; Carrobot and Exploride are also wifi hotspots via the OBD-II port plug-in, and they’ll provide additional alerts from your phone.
All of this is possible because these aftermarket HUDs use your phone plus information from your car, if it’s connected via the OBD-II port. You position the device on the dashboard between the steering wheel and the windshield, and connect it to your phone and car. The device projects information from your onto a clear screen, which makes it appear as if the information is hovering in space in front of your car. Carrobot even performs some driving assistance tasks, like letting you know if you’re straying from your lane.
Carrobot is in the crowdfunding stage on Indiegogo, with an estimated shipping date of March 2017. It’s already shipped a first version to the Chinese market, so it expects to be able to hit this North American target date without delays. (Navdy, we’re looking at you.) Carrobot starts at $199, with more feature-filled versions at $399 and $499.
HUDs are becoming more available as an option baked right into vehicles at the factory, but the technology has been around for years. Early HUDs were in luxury cars like Audis, BMWs, and Cadillacs, but the systems are finding their way into less expensive cars. A press release from March 2015 noted that at the time, 30% of all GM vehicles sold in North America were equipped with a head-up display.
But as people transition to new automotive technology faster than they buy new cars, aftermarket HUDs are likely to gain traction. These devices also take into account consumers’ preference for using their own apps on their own phone in their cars. It’s on the aftermarket manufacturers to make the experience as seamless as it would be with a built-in system.

773,Uber’s latest redesign aims for a quicker pickup,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/02/thequickerpickerupper/,2016/11/02,CONTENT ERROR
774,Facebook slaps down Admiral’s plan to use social media posts to price car insurance premiums,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/02/uk-car-insurance-firm-wants-to-scan-social-media-posts-to-price-premiums/,2016/11/02,"
UK insurance firm Admiral had intended to launch an app this week offering discounted car insurance premiums to first time drivers based on an algorithmic assessment of their Facebook posts.
All drivers would have had to do is sign in with their Facebook login to grant permission to the company to scan their Facebook posts in order to get a potential discount on their car insurance premiums.
However the experiment has fallen foul of Facebook’s platform policy, which puts strict limits on how developers on the platform can use the information users share with them.
Clause 3.15 of the policy also specifically prohibits use of data obtained from Facebook to

…make decisions about eligibility, including whether to approve or reject an application or how much interest to charge on a loan.

In an interview with The Guardian about the opt-in firstcarquote app, project lead Dan Mines described it as “a test”, saying: “We are doing our best to build a product that allows young people to identify themselves as safe drivers… This is innovative, it is the first time anyone has done this.”
The algorithms that Admiral had developed for the app apparently aimed to glean personality traits from users’ Facebook posts by analyzing how posts were written — with individuals who scored well for qualities such as conscientiousness and organization more likely to be offered discounts vs those who came across as overconfident/less well organized, as judged by their Facebook postings.
Photos were not intended to be used to assess drivers — the analysis was purely based on text updates to Facebook.
“Our analysis is not based on any one specific model, but rather on thousands of different combinations of likes, words and phrases and is constantly changing with new evidence that we obtain from the data,” Yossi Borenstein, the principal data scientist on the project, told the paper. “As such our calculations reflect how drivers generally behave on social media, and how predictive that is, as opposed to fixed assumptions about what a safe driver may look like.”
Giving a more specific example of how Admiral’s app would be assessing a Facebook user’s attitude behind the wheel, The Guardian suggested overuse of exclamation marks in Facebook posts might count against a first time driver, while posting lists and writing in short, concrete sentences containing specific detail would be seen as a plus.
Admiral said no price rises would be incurred as a result of using the app but discounts of up to £350 were set to be offered — although the company was also not ruling out expanding the project in future to loop in additional social media services and, potentially, to also increase premiums for some drivers.
“The future is unknown,” said Mines. “We don’t know if people are prepared to share their data. If we find people aren’t sharing their data, then we won’t ever get to consider that [expanding firstcarquote].”
As it turns out, the app’s future is unknown as Facebook is not prepared to share user data with Admiral for this eligibility assessment use-case. Which, if the team had read Facebook’s platform policy, should have been immediately clear.
Presumably Admiral has been working on the app for multiple months at the very least. Yet again, any Facebook platform developer should be aware that all apps are subject to final review by the company before they can go live to ensure compliance with its platform policy. Even “test” apps.
Admiral now says the firstcarquote launch has been delayed — noting on the website that: “We were really hoping to have our sparkling new product ready for you, but there’s a hitch: we still have to sort a few final details.”
It also touts other use cases for the app — such as being able to see what some other new drivers have paid for car insurance and some details of the cars they drive. Although that’s a far cry from offering first time drivers discounts based on how many exclamations marks they typically deploy in their Facebook posts.
We tried to contact the company with questions but at the time of writing Admiral had not responded, and its press office had professed itself too busy to speak — with an outside PR firm being engaged to fence queries. We’ll update this story with any response.
In a statement provided to TechCrunch a Facebook spokesperson confirmed Admiral will only be able to use Facebook accounts for login and identity verification — so not for scanning post data. The company further suggests the insurer intends to rework the app to create an alternative data source to assess drivers’ eligibility.
The Facebook spokesperson said:

We have clear guidelines that prevent information being obtained from Facebook from being used to make decisions about eligibility.
We have made sure anyone using this app is protected by our guidelines and that no Facebook user data is used to assess their eligibility. Facebook accounts will only be used for login and verification purposes.
Our understanding is that Admiral will then ask users who sign up to answer questions which will be used to assess their eligibility.

It’s worth noting that Facebook has itself patented using social graph for assessing eligibility of creditworthiness, as the Atlantic reported last year.
US patent 9,100,400, granted to Facebook in August 2015, includes a specific method for authenticating an individual for access to information or service “based on that individual’s social network” — with one of the examples given using the scenario of a service provider being a lender who assesses an individual’s creditworthiness based on the average credit rating of the people the individual is connected to on their social network…
In a fourth embodiment of the invention, the service provider is a lender. When an individual applies for a loan, the lender examines the credit ratings of members of the individual’s social network who are connected to the individual through authorized nodes. If the average credit rating of these members is at least a minimum credit score, the lender continues to process the loan application. Otherwise, the loan application is rejected.
It’s unclear whether Facebook intends or intended to launch any such creditworthiness assessment service itself — we asked and it did not respond. But many patents are filed defensively and/or speculatively. And, as the Atlantic notes, using a person’s social graph to assess creditworthiness would run huge risks of attracting discrimination lawsuits. So the patent does not really read like a serious product proposal on Facebook’s part.
Beyond that, if Facebook’s platform were to become implicated in weighty external assessments of individuals, with the potential to have seriously negative impacts on their lives, the company would risk discouraging users from sharing the sort of personal data its ad-targeting business model relies on. Which is surely part of the reason it’s denying Admiral the ability to scan Facebook posts to assess driving proficiency.
Facebook is already negatively implicated in state surveillance activity as a honeypot of data utilized by intelligence and law enforcement agencies. And on privacy grounds, given its own business model relies on profiling users for ad targeting. But stepping into offering formal assessments of individuals’ creditworthiness, for example, would feel like a massive pivot for the social media giant — although the temptation for it to try to unlock more ‘worth’ from the mountain of data it sits on is only set to grow, given AI’s rising star and growing appetite for data.
In a blog post welcoming Facebook blocking Admiral from scanning users’ posts, digital rights organization the Open Rights Group points out the underlying biases that can make any such algorithmic assessments problematic.
“There are significant risks in allowing the financial or insurance industry to base assessments on our social media activity,” writes Jim Killock. “We might be penalised for our posts or denied benefits and discounts because we don’t share enough or have interests that mark us out as different and somehow unreliable.  Whether intentional or not, algorithms could perpetuate social biases that are based on race, gender, religion or sexuality. Without knowing the criteria for such decisions, how can we appeal against them?”
“Insurers and financial companies who are beginning to use social media data need engage in a public discussion about the ethics of these practices, which allow a very intense examination of factors that are entirely non-financial,” he adds.
Facebook’s data is rich, but often ambiguous, may lack context and presents many risks. It is not clear to us that social media information is an appropriate tool for financial decision making.
Asked for his view on the risks of Facebook itself using its platform to sell assessments on the fitness of its users for accessing other products/services, such as financial products, Killock also told TechCrunch: “Rules on profiling and use of data have to ensure that people are not disadvantaged, unfairly judged, or discriminated against. Facebook’s data is rich, but often ambiguous, may lack context and presents many risks. It is not clear to us that social media information is an appropriate tool for financial decision making.”
Also blogging about Admiral’s attempt to turn Facebook data into premium-affecting personality assessments, law professor Paul Bernal voices similar concerns about what he dubs the “very significant” risks of such a system being discriminatory.
“Algorithmic analysis, despite the best intentions of those creating the algorithms, are not neutral, but embed the biases and prejudices of those creating and using them,” he writes. “A very graphic example of this was unearthed recently, when the first international beauty contest judged by algorithms managed to produce remarkably prejudiced results – almost all of the winners were white, despite there being no conscious mention of skin colour in the algorithms.”
Bernal also argues that the sort of linguistic analysis Admiral’s app was apparently intending would have “very likely”  favored Facebook users in command of “what might be seen as ‘educated’ language – and make any kind of regional, ethnic or otherwise ‘non-standard’ use of language put its user at a disadvantage”.
“The biases concerned could be racial, ethnic, cultural, regional, sexual, sexual-orientation, class-based – but they will be present, and they will almost certainly be unfair,” he adds.
Bernal goes on to suggest that Facebook users develop “survival tactics” as a short term fix for defeating any assessments being made of them based on their social graphs and footprints — urging especially young people (who are perhaps currently most at risk of being harmfully judged by their social media activity) to “keep the more creative sides of your social life off Facebook”.
He also calls for a push by regulators towards developing a framework for algorithmic accountability to control the autonomous technologies being increasingly deployed to control us.
“Algorithms need to be monitored and tested, their impact assessed, and those who create and use them to be held accountable for that impact,” he adds. “Insurance is just one example – but it is a pertinent one, where the impact is obvious. We need to be very careful here, and not walk blindly into something that has distinct problems.”
Algorithmic accountability was also flagged as a concern by a UK science and technology parliamentary committee last month, in a report considering the “host of social, ethical and legal questions” that arise from growing use of autonomous technologies, and given how quickly machine learning algorithms are being deployed to wrangle insights from data-sets.
The committee recommended the government establishes a standing Commission on Artificial Intelligence aimed at “identifying principles to govern the development and application of AI”, and to provide advice and encourage public dialogue about automation technologies.
While, in the US, a recent White House report also considered the risk of biases embedded in AI.

775,Otonomo raises $12 million to make data from connected cars useful,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/01/otonomo-raises-12-million-to-make-data-from-connected-cars-useful/,2016/11/01,"
Even if self-driving cars aren’t part of our daily lives yet, vehicles are becoming internet-connected at a rapid pace.
Gartner predicts that one-fifth of all autos on the road, and a great majority of new vehicles being produced worldwide, will have wireless network connectivity by 2020. Yet, few organizations have access to use the data generated by these vehicles today.
That’s where Otonomo, a startup based in Herzliya, Israel comes in.
The company’s systems gather driver and vehicle data from disparate automakers and original equipment manufacturers. It then normalizes the data, so different organizations can use it to learn more about drivers collectively, or reach them with new products and services.
Otonomo has raised $12 million in venture funding to scale its technology and business. Bessemer Venture Partners led the round, joined by StageOne Ventures, Maniv Mobility and LocalGlobe.
Along with the venture funding, Otonomo announced that Steve Girksy, a former vice chairman of GM, and Mary Chan, a former general manager of OnStar, have joined its board of advisors. Andy Geisse, who previously ran AT&T Business Solutions, joined Otonomo’s board of directors, as well.
Bessemer Venture Partners’ Vice President Amit Karp said what Otonomo is doing today will help bring new products and services to automotive and adjacent industries like insurance, smart cities, transportation and travel, or finance.
Otonomo CEO and co-founder Ben Volkow illustrated many examples where data from vehicles could be useful now that developers and corporations can get their hands on it more easily.
A mayor’s office could study driver behavior at major city intersections to optimize signage or traffic lights for better safety. Companies like Starbucks, Dunkin’ Donuts or McDonald’s could deliver a coupon to drivers who have been on the road for a long while already, and whose vehicle is approaching one of their stores. And insurance adjusters could attain data directly from a vehicle, rather than waiting for a driver to self-report it, in the event of an accident in order to process claims faster.
“If a company or developer wants to build a service for connected cars, today they will have to deal with all the original equipment manufacturers, attain the data, normalize it, and strike all kinds of commercial agreements with automakers. Otonomo, is a neutral third party they can go to instead,” Karp said.
He compared Otonomo to Stripe for payments online or Twilio for communications.
Otonomo intends to use its newly raised capital for hiring, product research and development, and to continue building relationships with critical auto makers and original equipment manufacturers, the CEO said.
One of the keys to making data from connected cars accessible to other businesses is making sure that it is disclosed only as local, state and national laws, and different business policies will allow.
“Inside our policy engine we have hundreds of rules configured. We work with lawyers and know all the different regulations and rules. If a car maker shares data with whoever, they know we check all the parameters, then blur, anonymize and otherwise make sure they can share the data without violating anyone’s privacy or rules,” Volkow said.
The CEO said automakers are eager to work with Otonomo because the company is helping them monetize data that they were shoring up, but Otonomo is not a competitor to their core business the way that other tech firms like Google or Apple may appear, given their initiatives to build self-driving cars and related systems.

776,Uber and GM partner to offer drivers car sharing through Maven,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/01/uber-and-gm-partner-to-offer-drivers-car-sharing-through-maven/,2016/11/01,"
Uber has announced that it will be teaming up with GM’s car-sharing company, Maven, allowing drivers to rent GM vehicles on a weekly basis in a 90-day pilot program to see how the arrangement works. This is separate from, but similar to, GM’s Express Drive program, wherein the carmaker makes vehicles available to Lyft drivers on an all-in short-term rental basis when they lack their own vehicle to qualify for use with Lyft.
The pilot project with Uber is debuting in San Francisco, and will operate only in that city for the time being. Maven expanded its own services (which primarily focus on providing Zipcar-like short-term rentals to members) to San Francisco residents earlier this month.
Per-week fees for use of the GM vehicles provided for use by Uber drivers is set at $179 for the pilot project, plus taxes and fees. Drivers also can use the cars for their own personal trips, in addition to the time they spend using them to ferry Uber passengers. This is in line with what Lyft drivers pay for GM cars via Express Drive, per GM VP of Maven and Urban Mobility Julia Steyn, according to Automotive News.
GM’s move isn’t surprising, given how much time and effort it’s investing in exploring alternatives to individual ownership in its future-focused mobility programs. It is interesting, however, in light of the closeness of the company’s relationship with Lyft before now, and rumors that circulated previously that GM may have suggested to Lyft it was interested in purchasing the smaller company, though Lyft has since denied that any formal acquisition talks took place.
Maven branching out into car sharing services that extend beyond the direct-to-consumer model is interesting, too — it suggests that the GM subsidiary could become far more than just a GM-vehicle exclusive Zipcar or car2go alternative. Business-to-business in addition to B2C offerings will make Maven a far more versatile tool in GM’s utility belt.

777,Sondors 3-wheeled EV uses new crowdfunding equity to raise $500k,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/01/sondors-3-wheeled-ev-uses-new-crowdfunding-equity-to-raise-500k/,2016/11/01,"
The Model Sondors 3-wheeled electric vehicle is the latest automotive startup to take advantage of new rules to raise funds. Sondors is using equity crowdfunding, “where a crowd of accredited and nonaccredited investors alike can invest up to $1 million in an early-stage company,” according to Grant Harvey, who is working with the company on this campaign.
This particular type of crowdfunding came into being as part of the JOBS Act passed in May. It’s different from the Regulation A+ stock offerings that Elio Motors used to raise funds for its gasoline-powered 3-wheeled car. Harvey worked with Elio on that campaign as well; both used the StartEngine capital crowdfunding site. Harvey said that Elio’s campaign “is the largest equity raise via Reg A+ in the country.” Sondors has some experience in successful crowdfunding as well. The company founder, Storm Sondors, previously raised $10 million on IndieGogo for his Sondors eBike.
The Model Sondors EV campaign had a minimum raise of $70,000, which the company raised within a day on StartEngine. The campaign is now halfway to its maximum allotted raise of $1 million with two months of fundraising left. The company plans to have a working prototype complete and ready to unveil within 12 months of the campaign’s closing date, with sales of 120,000 vehicles projected in the first year.
Crowdfunding small cars is an idea that’s spilling over into other countries. Uniti Sweden is using a similar campaign via FundedByMe to raise funds for its little electric car (with four wheels), and it’s 180% funded with more than two weeks left in the campaign.
The Model Sondors aims to provide inexpensive, accessible electric transportation. The car will be available with 50-mile, 100-mile, or 200-mile ranges, with a goal starting price of $10,000. It will also be able to recharge in a normal household outlet, so there’s no need to hire an electrician to install a charging station.
The tough sell isn’t the technology or the price point; it’s likely to be the shape. Sondors and Elio (and Arcimoto) are all putting bets on the three-wheeled design, which has not been a big hit in the past. Does anyone else remember the Dr. Seuss-esque Corbin Sparrow? It’s okay if you don’t; it’s apparently going to be resurrected next year. There are motorcycle-like trikes and recreational vehicles from Polaris and Morgan, but the 3-wheeler has yet to become a popular everyday vehicle. It’s licensed like motorcycles in most states, which lowers the regulatory hurdles required of a new car company. But even Toyota has a 3-wheel concept, so maybe its day will come.

Fisker Inc., the new electric car company founded by Henrik Fisker (not to be confused with his previous venture, now Karma) has revealed the design and specifications of its first vehicle, the luxury sport sedan all-electric EMotion (see what they did there?). The car will boast a top speed of 161 MPH, and will have a 400 mile range from its electric battery.
The body of the vehicle (which you can see in the renders above and below) is designed to help with aerodynamic performance, according to Fisker, Inc., helping it achieve both that ambitious range and its top speed. The look also shows how Fisker has moved the interior space forward, which the company says will help amplify the space to make it more comparable to full-size luxury sedans on the inside than to their “closest competitors,” which is almost certainly an unstated reference to the Tesla Model S.

Fisker also shared that the new EMotion will have a composite frame constructed of carbon fiber and aluminum, and new batteries created using graphene and produced by Fisker Nanotech, a dedicated battery supplier set up as a joint venture including Fisker and Nanotech Energy Inc.,
Fisker says that the EMotion will have all the hardware required to allow for full self-driving in the future, the tech for which is being supplied by a supplier the carmaker says it will reveal soon. As a result, the interior space is designed to be able to provide access to screens and infotainment to any seat, both front and rear, for use while the car is driving itself.
The EMotion now has a name and a defined look, but when is the thing actually going to ship? It’ll be produced in the U.S., Fisker says, and delivery timeframes will be made public once the actual car is first shown in public starting sometime in the middle of next year.

780,Volvo won’t mark its first self-driving cars to avoid trolling by humans,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/31/volvo-wont-mark-its-first-self-driving-cars-to-avoid-trolling-by-humans/,2016/10/31,"
Volvo has little confidence that human drivers will be reliably kind and courteous to the first robot cars to hit the road: The carmaker plans to leave its first road-faring self-driving cars, a pilot group of 100 SUVs leased to users in London sometime in 2018, completely unmarked. Details of the plan come from Volvo senior technical lead Erik Coelingh, who shared the info with The Guardian.
“I’m pretty sure that people will challenge them if they are marked by doing really harsh braking in front of a self-driving car or putting themselves in the way,” Coelingh explained to the British outlet, explaining why the automaker decided to leave the vehicles without any obvious indication that they’re fully autonomous.
It’s a reasonable fear to have: A recent study found that a sizeable number of human drivers are looking forward to the advent of self-driving cars precisely because they believe they’ll be able to bully them, since self-driving software will be tuned to go to any length to avoid collisions and drive as safely as possible. Because of the networked nature of self-driving systems, however, it’s possible networks could learn to identify specifically bad drivers over time, which might end up impacting their insurance and other factors, too.
Still, Volvo doesn’t want to tempt fate by giving hot-headed or aggro drivers any reason to single out their test cars rom the crowd, and that’s probably for the best. There’s no predicting the behavior of a cornered animal fighting for survival, and that’s what the human driver is soon to become.

781,Toyota partners with Getaround on car-sharing,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/31/toyota-partners-with-getaround-on-car-sharing/,2016/10/31,"
Carmakers continue to look at the future of transportation and invest in alternatives to individual ownership: Toyota is the latest to make a bet on a mobility model espoused by a startup, with a strategic investment in SF-based car sharing provider Getaround. Toyota’s investment also comes with integration with Getaround’s platform on the technology and finance side, incentivizing Toyota car owners to participate.
Getaround allows car owners to rent out their own vehicles when they’re not in use, in order to decrease the amount of time they spend idle and help car owners use their vehicles to help offset the cost of owning them in the first place.
As part of the new strategic partnership, Toyota will offer new vehicles, beginning with premium Lexus cars, for rental via Getaround with completely keyless entry and driving via their smartphone. Then beginning in January 2017, Toyota’s financial services wing will let Toyota car lessees make payments on their vehicle directly from their Getaround earnings pool, eliminating a step between revenue generation and applying that to offsetting the cost of the car.
The tie-up between Toyota and Getaround is reminiscent of some other carmaker/startup partnerships, including GM and Lyft. It’s also similar to the model Tesla envisions for its future Tesla Network, wherein car owners will be able to rent out their vehicles on-demand when not in use. Tesla’s future car-sharing revolved around the use of self-driving versions of its car, however.
More and more, automakers are making a wide range of bets on what follows individual car ownership in terms of other models for mobility, especially in urban areas. Building direct support of car-sharing into the platform is a smart bet, as is incorporating it directly into the financing model, as Toyota has done here.
Getaround won TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield at Disrupt New York in 2011. Competition from companies including Turo, as well as major automakers like Tesla eyeing the business model, indicate the space will probably get more competitive or see consolidation as carmakers look to bring expertise in the area in-house.

Armin G. Schmidt is founder and CEO of Advanced Telematic Systems, designing and guiding the development of software solutions for the mobility industry. Schmidt has held a variety of positions at innovative technology companies across Asia, Europe and the United States.


The Cité de l’Automobile in Mulhouse, France, is an amazing place. It has the largest collection of automobiles on display, thanks to the Swiss brothers Hans and Fritz Schlumpf and their obsession with cars. The money they needed for their collecting came from their business; the brothers owned a spinning mill for woolen products. Funnily enough, the German translation of “Schlumpf” is smurf. If anyone remembers the Smurfs, they would call it smurftastic.
Because of their excessive collection — and also because of the shift in textile production toward Asia in the 1970s — the brothers’ business eventually became insolvent, so they left France and returned to Switzerland. By that time, their collection of automobiles was so valuable that the French government placed a historical protection order on the collection to save it from destruction, break-up or export, and, in 1978 it was deemed a French Historic Monument by the Council of State.
Some years ago I had the privilege of visiting this place, which is now the largest car museum in the world. Indeed, it is a time capsule for the glory days of the automobile. When you walk through the museum’s enormous halls, filled with hundreds of classic cars, you see that most of them are from a time when “startups” (yes, I think you could attribute today’s term to those past entrepreneurs) built cars from scratch, creating brands and fighting for their own piece of the new mobility market. Horses were no longer a state-of-the-art form of transportation, thus horse riding ultimately became a luxury hobby, as we now know it.
The first auto boom was fueled by the invention of new technologies and the industrial revolution, which gave startups at that time the chance to engineer and build the first automobiles with a limited amount of funding. For example, in the 1920s, the main construction method was body-on-frame, which allowed a much more modular construction and the combination of parts from different suppliers. Then the unibody designs came and introduced highly integrated cars with more expensive set-up and development costs — but with positive cost effects on a large scale. With EV we now see the return of concepts with body-on-frame, like the BMW i3 with a rigid frame housing the drivetrain and battery.
The following names are just a fraction of the brands represented in the museum in Mulhouse. You can call yourself a true automobile expert if you recognize more than three of the brand names, and, if you do, the next drink is on me: ABC, Amilcar, Arzens, Aster, Ballot, Bardon, Barraco, Barré, Baudier, B.N.C, Bollée, Brasier, Charron, Cisitalia, Clément de Dion, Clément-Bayard, Clément-Panhard, Corre La Licorne, Darracq, Decauville, De Dietrich, De Dion-Bouton, Delage, Delahaye, Delaunay-Belleville, Dufaux, Ensais, Esculape, Farman, Fouillaron, Georges Richard, Gladiator, Gordini, Horlacher, Hotchkiss et Cie, Hotchkiss-Gregoire, Jaquot, Le Zèbre, Lorraine-Dietrich, M.A.F., Mathis, Maurer-Union, Menier, Minerva, Monet-Goyon, Mors, Neracar, O.M., Panhard & Levassor, Pegaso, Philos, Piccard-Pictet, Pilain, Ravel, Rheda, Richard-Brasier, Ripert, Rochet-Schneider, Sage, Salmson, Scott, Sénéchal, Serpollet, Sizaire-Naudin, Soncin, Turicum, Vermotel, Violet-Bogey, Zedel.
These fine startups produced motor vehicles in a time when the entry barrier was not yet defined by the combustion engine — a market that was ultimately dominated for more than 40 years by the likes of GM, Ford, Mercedes, Toyota, BMW, VW and others. This left a huge gap between the big guys and the smaller players, such as McLaren, Bugatti, Lotus and others.
Certainly there were startups like DeLorean, Fisker and Artega, but developing a combustion engine car, manufacturing, marketing and selling it, not to mention maintaining a dealer value chain, was (some say still is) a game dominated by size and pure financial power. Successfully creating a new startup in the car category was no easy task. Every venture receiving less than an estimated $100 million investment would fail, sooner or later. Especially for investors, this category was largely viewed as untouchable, due to the extensive risk involved and a low success rate.
We are seeing a large number of new startups aiming to create new cars, commercial vehicles and other methods of transportation.
That all changed with one guy and a roadshow in Taiwan in 2004. He was trying to secure funding there, and in various other places, for his first model: the Roadster. Most components of the prototype car at that time were sourced and developed on this island of 23 million people, which is famous for supplying more than 80 percent of the world’s PC and Notebook manufacturers, delivering nearly all chips for the iPhones and other consumer electronic devices, as well as being known for its own manufacturing powerhouses, including Foxconn, Pegatron and Wistron.
At the time of Tesla’s launch in 2006, the company’s engines were manufactured at the Tesla facility in Taiwan. Elon Musk understood from the very beginning that the IT and automotive worlds would intersect. He secured the initial funding and started to think big — not listening to the advice from many so-called experts. Tesla raised more than $180 million by 2009, to deliver 147 cars.
Several years, and billions in investments later, the world sees that Tesla was able to do what other companies never dared — attack the traditional heavyweight car industry. Because of computer power, a new level of momentum and the state of evolution, we are now entering another chapter in the “Innovator’s Dilemma” This theory, purported by Harvard professor Clayton Christensen, describes when new technologies cause great firms to fail. And more importantly, competitive products have been created that premium companies like Audi, BMW, Toyota and Mercedes now take very seriously.
The huge financial and technology barriers have been broken down. The venture capital world is delighted by the opportunities and has begun to attack this category. Over the last five years the M&A transactions in this space have grown in excess of $220 billion.
Entry barriers based on highly sophisticated production, such as the combustion engine, will be phased out. Electric components are becoming more mainstream. For instance, e-drivetrains are outsourced nowadays to ODMs, such as Magna, and will eventually go to the Foxconns of this world.
But more importantly, Tesla’s unique advantages in machine learning, and its lack of exposure to legacy systems (internal combustion tech, unconnected cars) give it the chance to tap into larger and faster-growing markets ahead of its competitors. The move from the traditional model without connectivity and computers will change to one of owned autonomy, shared mobility and, eventually, to Autopia-on-demand autonomous mobility.
We are seeing a large number of new startups aiming to create new cars, commercial vehicles and other methods of transportation. Some names include: NextEV, Atieva, ThunderPower, Gogoro, Navya, Borgward, Local Motors, ZMP, Faraday Future, Starship, Varden Labs, Easy Mile, Auro Robotics, Gaius Automotive, Elio, LeEco, nuTonomy, Dyson, Mission Motors, Boosted, Lit Motors, Renovo Motors, Inboard Technology, Future Motion, GLM, Dubuc Motors, Dagmy Motors, Newton Vehicles, ALTe Technologies, Lumen Motors, Barham Motors, Highlands Power, Myers Motors, Tratus, Virtus Motors, AC Motors, Scalar Automotive, Fenix Vehicles, Marfil, Esco Motors, Lithos Motors. I expect to see hundreds more on the scene in the coming years.
Don’t be surprised if there are Red Bull-branded cars driving around in the near future.
Even the most innovative mobility concepts eventually require a vehicle. In comparison to today’s vehicles, they might have a different form factor, or be made from different material, be powered differently and controlled in another way. But someone has to develop, manufacture, sell, maintain and guarantee the vehicle. Existing automakers still have those competencies and the ability to adapt over time, if some parameters can change, as described. They have the knowledge and the processes to turn a profit while still producing such a complex, long-lasting, safety focused product, and they know how to scale it. In addition to this, they have an existing brand, reputation and customer loyalty that will last for a certain time.
The premier brands will, for a certain period, have an advantage. And so do the fast and cash-laden newcomers. We also will most likely see brands and companies focusing on certain mobility niches. Many future developments will be based on still-open questions, such as how new vehicles will be used, how urban and rural area mobility will be separated, how fast e-vehicles and autonomous technology will take the lead and be accepted or how regulations will accelerate or slow down certain development.
Consumers still look for some branding values in the automotive environment. Companies such as Porsche, as well as other premium brands, benefit from this, and therefore won’t likely be as affected as other mass-market brands. New and existing brands will be used for cars, as in the past Fender for the VW Beetle, Paul Smith for Mini, Gucci with the Fiat 500 and numerous others. Don’t be surprised if there are Red Bull-branded cars driving around in the near future.

Also, even if automotive mobility becomes smarter and cheaper, brands will play their part. Even easyJet, Virgin and Ryanair, a few low-cost carriers in the aviation industry, are brands with positioning. In aviation, the service providers (airlines) are the popular brands chosen by travelers, not the makers of the vehicles (airplanes). This might be an imaginable parallel between the automotive and aviation industries.
Remember the list of car companies exhibited at the Cité de l’Automobile? Startups that have come and gone, leaving museum pieces as their legacy. In the same vein, clearly not all of the current automobile companies mentioned herein will still be around in the next few years — but some of them will certainly become dominant fixtures in our everyday mobility.
There are so many new brands and innovations entering today’s huge $6.4 trillion (McKinsey) market of mobility that are not only creating cars, but also developing completely new ways of approaching mobility, which will result in fewer fatalities, safer roads and many more improvements.
Some time down the road a museum like the Schlumpf brothers’ will most likely consist of brands that we all know of today. I am looking forward to seeing a collector gathering together all these new vehicles (the ultimate mobile devices) and creating this museum. It will be interesting for our kids and grandchildren — and not simply because it’s associated with Smurfs. History always repeats itself.

783,Vehicle security device Ernest launches today,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/28/vehicle-security-device-ernest-launches-today/,2016/10/28,"
Ernest is a bit difficult to describe. It’s a device, it’s two devices, it’s an app, and according to its founder, Arturs Pumpurs, it’s a kind of virtual butler. The system secures your vehicle, tells you where it is, and controls your garage door or, if you have one, gate. The Kickstarter campaign starts October 28 and runs through December 7.
The project began as a way to protect vehicles, with a Bluetooth 4.0-enabled device that can be installed by the user but should probably be installed by professionals. That’s because if you have the immobilizer feature, Ernest keeps fuel from getting to the engine unless it recognizes your device. You can allow other people with other devices to use the car, and you can also revoke those privileges.
The Ernest GPS devices, like many car-related apps and devices, will show you your car’s location plus driving information like speed and distance. It will also guide you to your car if you forgot where you left it or you share it with other people.
The same secure Bluetooth-based sharing principle applies to garage doors and gates. This requires a second Ernest device that you install in the gate or door panel itself, not in the car. Then, you connect the same Ernest app on your phone, the one that controls access to your vehicle, to the door device. Once again, you can share and revoke access to your garage door.
While Ernest would make one person or family’s life a bit easier, there’s potential here for security in the sharing economy. When your car and private garage are used by multiple people, knowing who has access and cutting off that access when, say, their vacation rental is up would be helpful. If a car is being shared, it would be nice to know who used it when and how many miles were driven by each owner. Just set every user up with the app and give them access.
During the Kickstarter campaign, the Auto GPS (without the immobilizer feature) starts at $60, and prices go up from there. It’s too expensive for a fleet operator to use, but it might work for limited sharing situations.

784,Maven expands car-sharing network to L.A.,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/28/maven-expands-car-sharing-network-to-l-a/,2016/10/28,"
GM’s Maven car-sharing service is adding yet another city to the list of places where it’s available: Los Angeles. The addition of L.A. comes quick on the heels of its recent expansion into San Francisco, which means there are now two California markets on board.
Maven is GM’s in-house alternative to offerings like Zipcar and Enterprise CarShare. The program will host an initial fleet of 60 cars for members to choose from in L.A., available on-demand 24 hours, from pick-up locations located in the downtown, Little Tokyo and South Park areas of the city to begin with, with planned expansions down the road.
Maven is also touting over 23 million miles driven across 12,000 reservations at this point, after a launch in early 2016. That number also includes makes driven via GM’s Express Drive program with Lyft, whereby drivers who want to act as service providers for the on-demand ridesharing network can rent out cars on demand, too.
“Los Angeles is a natural fit for Maven because of the city’s incredible appetite for cars,” said Julia Steyn, vice president of Urban Mobility and Maven in a press release.
Part of GM’s goal with Maven is showcasing new vehicles, which means members get access to Chevy Cruze, Malibu, Tahoe, Volt, as well as GMC Acadia and Yukon, and Cadillac ATS, CTS, CT6, XT5 and Escalade. Drivers will be charged a rate depending on their vehicle, starting at $8 per hour and with daily rates also available. All cars include OnStar, and in-car 4G LTE wireless connections.

785,Comma.ai cancels the Comma One following NHTSA letter,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/28/comma-ai-cancels-the-comma-one-following-nhtsa-letter/,2016/10/28,"
Renowned iPhone hacker turned entrepreneur George Hotz (aka geohot) has cancelled his autonomous driving startup’s first official product, the Comma One aftermarket add-on that would’ve allowed certain cars to gain Autopilot-like highway driving assistance abilities.
Hotz announced the news on the Comma.ai official Twitter account, noting that the decision to cancel was made after he received a letter from the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The NHTSA letter explained that given its mandate of ensuring safety on U.S. roadways, it needed to ensure the Comma One is compliant with regulations before it can be offered for sale.
NHTSA then issued a “special order” directed at Comma.ai, which insisted that the company provide detailed answers to 15 questions related to Comma One, its design, testing practices and information regarding safety trials, intended target vehicles and anticipated sales timeline. These appear to be fairly standard requirements for a device that purports to be able to take over operation of your car, even if only in limited circumstances.
Hotz tweeted from the official Comma.ai account that rather than providing the requisite response, the company would instead be cancelling Comma One entirely, and turning its attention to “other products and markets,” since Hotz says that the prospect of a life “dealing with regulators and lawyers… isn’t worth it.” Hotz noted that he was tweeting from Shenzhen, China, which could suggest he was in the process of working on some aspect of Comma One’s production.
The Comma One was unveiled for the first time at TechCrunch Disrupt SF this past September, when Hotz presented the product and announced that it would be shipping to early customers by the end of this year. On stage, I asked Hotz about safety issues and concerns, but he expressed confidence that Comma One wasn’t doing anything existing technology on the market doesn’t already offer.
Hotz had criticized competitors for not being able to actually ship autonomous or driver-assistance features on stage, and also detailed a series of exchanges between himself and Tesla CEO Elon Musk around a potential job offer for Hotz at the electric car company.
We’ve reached out to Hotz for more info on the Comma One cancellation and what kind of alternative products and markets Comma.ai is looking at next, but had not received a response in time for publication. The full NHTSA letter received by Comma.ai is embedded below.

786,How to watch Tesla’s solar roof unveiling live,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/28/how-to-watch-teslas-solar-roof-unveiling-live/,2016/10/28,"
Tesla is having a special event Friday at 5:30 PM PT, and the company is streaming the show live on its website. You can definitely expect to see a brand new solar roof product, as well as Powerwall 2.0, since Elon Musk himself has said those are the focus of the launch.


Solar roof plus Powerwall 2.0 launch event will be webcast live on https://t.co/46TXqRrsdr at 5:30pm PDT tomorrow
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 27, 2016



It’s common practice when Tesla has a launch event for it broadcasts the stream directly from its home page, so that’s your best bet for watching live while the solar roof first sees the light of day (get it?). And there will be light, because the start time of the event has been pushed up slightly to 5:30 PM PT to ensure there is:


Solar roof unveil now at 5:30pm sharp (need daylight, for obvious reasons) California time tomorrow.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 27, 2016



Tesla’s solar roof is going to be an actual roofing replacement material, rather than something you add to the roof after the fact. Musk envisions it being used by customers in new home builds, and in situations where an existing roof has reached the end of its life and needs a full replacement.
Previously, Musk talked about how this roof would be integrated not only with a second generation of Tesla’s Powerwall home energy storage battery, but also a Tesla vehicle charger, so that will likely also be part of the unveil. Taken together, it should present a fairly complete look at what Tesla wants to offer customers in terms of a whole-home energy solution, so check back on Tesla.com at 5:30 PM PT/8:30 PM ET to see what’s revealed, and of course we’ll have coverage of everything as it happens here on TechCrunch, too.

787,What to expect from the Tesla solar roof event on October 28,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/27/what-to-expect-from-the-tesla-solar-roof-event-on-october-28/,2016/10/27,"
Tesla is hosting an event this coming Friday in L.A., and it’s doing so in tandem with SolarCity. This will be a sort of preview of what we can expect from the companies once they combine into one under the Tesla umbrella, which should happen soon, provided investors are on board. We know that Tesla will show off a new roofing material with integrated solar panels, with an integrated Powerwall 2.0 home energy storage solution and Tesla charger, because Elon Musk told us so — but we don’t know what else we might see.
Solar roof
The solar roofing solution is something that Musk has discussed a number of times, including first during a SolarCity conference call and then on Twitter, and most recently during Tesla’s own earnings call on October 26. The big difference between this and past solar panel offerings from SolarCity is that these are designed to replace traditional roofing materials, not be added on after the fact. Musk has said that this means they expect it won’t appeal as a retrofit solution, but will instead appeal more to new builds or those due for rooftop replacement.
The roof image depicted in Tesla’s event invite.
On Tuesday’s Q3 Tesla earnings call, Musk said that he believes the solar roof material “looks better than a normal roof.” He teased that “you’ll be quite impressed by what we debut on Friday,” saying “it’s exceeded [his] expectations” and concluding that he “thinks it’s really great” before stopping himself from saying more in the interest of preserving the surprise.
Musk’s plan includes an initial goal of replacing some 5 million rooftops in the U.S. with Tesla’s solar-gathering alternative, and all of this is part of his “Master Plan,” which has always included “Provide solar power” as one of his goals. Part 2, revealed in July, includes this as one of four new goals.
Create stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage
Powerwall 2.0
That brings us to Powerwall 2.0, which is the battery storage portion of that equation. Tesla’s first Powerwall debuted in April 2015, and offered home storage for either 7 kWh or 10 kWh for $3,000 and $3,500, respectively.
Tesla’s original Powerwall.
The revision to Powerwall set to be unveiled at Friday’s event should be flatter than the previous edition, and shown and sold in Tesla stores, rather than exclusively via distributors, as reported by Electrek. The site has also previously reported that Tesla plans to double the storage capacity of the new version of the power pack, and produce them in greater volume.
If Tesla can increase capacity while keeping costs at or near level, that would be a terrific accomplishment and a big incentivizing factor to help expand sales to a broader group of potential customers. Storage is a key component of a self-sufficient solar electric power system for the home, and greater capacity also helps ensure your Tesla vehicle can take full advantage of the system, too.
Tesla charger
The new charger could be integrated directly into the Powerwall 2.0 as an option, which could help improve the speed of charging, depending on how it’s drawing and supplying current to the connected Tesla vehicle.
There’s also a possibility that it could then act as a virtual extension of the Powerwall, Electrek theorizes, feeding energy back into the grid in instances where it would do more good in your home than in your car, during a power outage for example.

Tesla has previously previewed a prototype charger that uses an articulating robotic arm to automatically find your Tesla’s charging port and plug in, but we haven’t heard much about that since the company showed a video of it in operation in August 2015. Musk recently tweeted that video, however, while discussing how a fully self-driving Tesla equipped with the company’s new sensor suite and on-board computer could drive itself across the U.S. on demand.


Using the automated solid metal snake charger :) https://t.co/lBG6GamNqJ
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 20, 2016



It would be great if the snake charger was part of the system unveiled at this event, but we don’t have any strong indication it will at this point.
This might be the best look we’ve ever had at what Elon Musk’s Master Plan looks like taken in totality, so it’s definitely worth checking out. TechCrunch will have live coverage of the event as it happens, so check back on October 28 for much more.

788,Tesla touts reliability and production improvements as reasons for Q3 success,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/26/tesla-touts-reliability-and-production-improvements-as-reasons-for-q3-success/,2016/10/26,"
Elon Musk began Tesla’s earning call regarding its third-quarter results on an up beat: He suggested that Q4 will also be strong for the company, deflating some analyst commentary that the results for this most recent reporting period might’ve been up at the expense of the next one.
“We currently believe Q4 will be profitable excluding non-cash stock-based expenses,” he said on the call, noting that “there’s a chance — just a chance — this will be true even including non-cash stock-based expenses” and adding that the results for Q3 represent “one of the best moments ever in Tesla.”
Tesla CFO Jason Wheeler explained that Tesla made a lot of deliveries at the very end of the quarter, which will carry over to Q4, helping with that quarter’s receivable balance. Musk also noted that contrary to some analyst supposition, the numbers for this quarter were not accomplished via discounting, which has actually been “absolutely shut down to zero” at this point, and which were “few and far between” even leading up to now.
Musk discussed how production of the 100 kWh battery pack used in the new P100 models has also improved, from only “limited” volume during the last quarter, and sold represent “a pretty significant portion of the mix” for the upcoming reporting period. 100 kWh production is currently one of Musk’s top priorities, the CEO noted, adding that he has a progress call on the subject “seven days a week.”
Wheeler also cited reliability improvements for cars coming off the line as a driver of cost improvements, since there are fewer warranty-related costs as a result. Musk characterized reliability improvements as “massive” and Wheeler specified a 92 percent improvement in warranty costs for the Model X specifically since its launch. This is promising news considering Consumer Reports just released a report dinging the Model X for reliability issues.

Musk also addressed general productivity improvements, noting that they’ve reached their 2,000 vehicle per week target in part by Elon Musk camping out in the “friggin factory” to improve delivery — along with the help of  key members of the Tesla team. Tesla CTO JB Straubel also noted on the call that Tesla has put “a huge amount of engineering intention” into bettering the overall capital expenditure cost of vehicle production lines.
The rosy financial picture led Musk to reiterate and elaborate on an assertion he made previously on Twitter that he doesn’t anticipate the need for a capital raise in the near future, either for Tesla or for SolarCity.
“Take this with a grain of salt (as in speculation or best guess), but our current financial plan does not require any capital raise for Model 3, at all,” Musk said. “That’s different from saying whether we should raise capital or not, to account for uncertainty, to have a larger buffer or to de-risk the business,” he cautioned.
“It seems like we probably won’t want to do a capital raise even in Q1,” he added. “I’m not saying we won’t, but it’s not looking like we will.”
The Model 3 line is designed to be a cash generator as production ramps up, Musk said, which should help improve Tesla’s overall cash position through next year. That, combined with Musk’s prediction on the call that capital expenditure should be higher this year than next overall, should help improve the company’s financial picture further going forward.

789,"Musk on Tesla Network: “It’s not Tesla vs. Uber, it’s the people vs. Uber”",https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/26/musk-on-tesla-network-its-not-tesla-vs-uber-its-the-people-vs-uber/,2016/10/26,"
When Elon Musk revealed Tesla’s plan to ship all Tesla’s made going forward with all the hardware they need to achieve full autonomy, the company noted that car owners would not be able to use their future self-driving Teslas to drive for Uber or Lyft. Instead, they’d be able to rent out their cars on demand using Tesla’s own Tesla Network for ridesharing. On Tesla’s Q3 earning call, Musk addressed claims this was a shot across Uber’s bow.
Asked on the earnings call whether Tesla Network was designed as a revenue-generating line of business for Tesla itself, or more as a value-add offering designed to incentivize vehicle purchases and grow market share, Musk noted that it was actually not just one or the other.
“It’s a bit of both really,” Musk said on the call. “This would be something that would be a significant offset on the cost of ownership for a car, and a revenue generator for Tesla as well, but the majority of the revenue would go to owners.”
Musk also then addressed observer characterization that this might be Tesla’s plan to compete with Uber (and other ride-hailing services directly).
“This has been characterized as Tesla vs. Uber,” he said. “But it’s not Tesla versus Uber, it’s the people versus Uber.”
Clearly, Musk sees the Tesla Network as a way to give vehicle owners a way to control monetization of their own vehicles, in an arrangement that likely will drive more revenue generation for vehicle owners than might be derived from working through with Uber or Lyft and subsequently offering those services a percentage of revenue derived from providing their vehicles.

790,Tesla says it actually posted a profit this quarter,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/26/tesla-says-it-actually-posted-a-profit-this-quarter/,2016/10/26,"
Well that was unexpected — Tesla reported today in its third-quarter that it had earnings of 74 cents per share, compared to Wall Street’s expectations of a loss of 54 cents per share.
In other words: Tesla said it actually made a profit this quarter on a GAAP basis. Tesla shares quickly jumped around 5.5 percent following the company posting a rare profit for the quarter.
“Furthermore, we expect this to continue into Q4 and project positive GAAP net income (excluding non-cash stock-based compensation) despite [Zero-emission vehicle] credit sales in Q4 likely being negligible,” the company said in a statement. “We set new records for vehicle production, deliveries and revenue, which led to GAAP profitability and positive free cash flow (cash flows from operations less capital expenditures). At the same time, GAAP total automotive gross margin and gross profit per car increased substantially.”

Tesla still said it planned to ship around 50,000 vehicles for the second half of the year, with 25,000 planned shipments for the fourth quarter this year. The company also said it still plans to be on track to deliver 500,000 vehicles in 2018. The company had originally targeted that shipment goal by 2020, but it bumped it up earlier this year accompanying an earnings report and a large number of pre-orders for the Model S.
Throughout the year, Tesla has made a lot of aggressive moves, including working to expand its self-driving car efforts, and ramping up its car shipments. Earlier this month, Tesla reported that it shipped 24,500 cars in the third quarter. Tesla actually revised that estimate slightly upward by around 300 cars.
Tesla is still in a tricky position as it works to push through its acquisition of SolarCity and deals with some delays in satisfying the full demand for the Model 3 — which recently started listing with shipment in 2018. It’s also trying to increase spending to ramp up production of the Model 3 and Model X, and earlier this year sold around $2 billion in shares to satisfy that spending.
Tesla shareholders will vote on the SolarCity acquisition on November 17. Tesla said it brought in $2.3 billion in revenue, compared to Wall Street’s estimates of $1.98 billion.

791,Uber’s new Driver API gives developers access to Uber’s other user pool,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/26/ubers-new-driver-api-gives-developers-access-to-ubers-other-user-pool/,2016/10/26,"
Uber has had developer tools for reaching riders for over two years, but now it’s also letting third-parties build products tailored specifically to its driver community, via a new Driver API revealed Wednesday. The Driver API will provide developers a direct channel to build apps for a targeted user group of drivers that Uber says is over 1.5 million people strong, according to a Medium post from Uber product lead Chris Saad, which is itself larger than most consumer-side communities enjoyed by a lot of apps and services.
The Driver API will make driver profile data, trip, earnings and other info available to developers for the purpose of creating apps tailored to enhancing or complementing the Uber driver experience. It’s also exposing Driver Ratings data, which Uber says can be useful as a kind of reputation metric to “bootstrap trust” for new services, or to act as a measure that can drive rewards.
Drivers have control over authorizing apps to access this data, similar to how apps that use Facebook or Google accounts for login or registration request access to that profile information. The three endpoints available to developers including driver profile info, including rating as mentioned; trip info, including things like distance and fare; and payment, including payments made to the driver, when and for how much.
Uber has already been working with some partners to demonstrate potential uses of the Driver API, and the results include a resume building tool, a Sears Auto Center loyalty points reward program based on number of completed trips and an app that creates route recommendations based on combined trip data to maximize driver earring potential. There’s also a Stride app for helping drivers keep on top of their taxes and earnings, and an upfront payment app called Activehours.
The Uber Driver API is available in a limited capacity now, though documentation is available publicly for anyone considering applying for access, which Uber will gate for the time being. Uber is smart to start making the most of the other side of its two-sided marketplace with these new developer tools, both in terms of further capitalizing on a sizeable resource and in terms of building an ecosystem that could lead to more loyal service providers.

792,GM puts IBM Watson in cars with the new OnStar Go platform,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/26/gm-puts-ibm-watson-in-cars-with-the-new-onstar-go-platform/,2016/10/26,"
GM is creating what it’s calling the “first cognitive mobility platform” in partnership with IBM, using the latter company’s Watson learning supercomputer. What that means is that cars featuring the new product, which is a continuation of GM’s OnStar offering called ‘OnStar Go’, will be more aware of their surroundings and better able to automate interactions both with the driver and with  businesses and facilities around them.
The system actually sounds similar in concept to Amazon’s Alexa, since it’s designed to allow your car to plug into connected services around you, and since IBM and GM actually call the abilities OnStar Go can gain “skills” in their press release revealing the new platform.
OnStar Go makes use of machine learning to analyze data gathered by the driver and use that to make informed decisions about potential product and service offerings from things in proximity to the car or within the car itself. For instance, it could recognize when the car is low on fuel, identify a nearby pump, pre-activate the pump for use and let the driver pay directly from their dash, or it could allow for pre-order of a coffee for pickup from a drive-in window, or use your listening habits to create a personalized radio station.
A lot of the potential uses described by IBM and GM in the release for OnStar Go make it seem like the platform is designed specifically to create more marketing opportunities for partners, and indeed the press release leads with this summary of the rollout plans:
Starting in early 2017, OnStar is expected to give millions of GM drivers the ability to connect and interact with their favorite brands.
Still, it sounds like it should be beneficial to customers, especially if drivers get the chance to specify which skills they want to be notified about and which they don’t. IBM and GM have already revealed some launch partners, and they include ExxonMobil, which will be able to tell drivers where nearby fill-up stations are, and okay payment from within their vehicle; iHeartRadio, which is using Watson’s personality insights to create personalized stations that are designed around a driver’s schedule; and MasterCard, which will let credit and debit cardholders pay for stuff right from their car’s dash.
The new OnStar Go features are set to go live in vehicles from GM by the end of 2017.

793,Lending Club zooms into car refinancings in turnaround effort,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/25/lending-club-zooms-into-car-refinancings-in-turnaround-effort/,2016/10/25,"
Many Americans learned through Lending Club that they can refinance their credit card debt online; now, the lending marketplace is hoping they’ll start refinancing their automotive loans using its platform, too.
Indeed, though automotive lending is a massive market, car refinance is far smaller owing to a lack of awareness, suggests Lending Club CEO Scott Sanborn, with whom we spoke by phone earlier today. “People know they can refinance their home. But after their home, their car is their second-largest purchase, yet the car refinance market in the U.S. was about $40 billion last year.”
In comparison, the overall U.S. auto loan debt market had grown to $1.103 trillion by this past June, according to the research firm Experian Automotive.
For Lending Club, it’s a prime opportunity (no pun intended), though it carries plenty of risk, as well.
The publicly traded, San Francisco-based company has struggled throughout 2016, following the forced resignation of its founder and CEO Renaud Laplanche in May over alleged conflicts of interest and a mishandled sale of loans to Jefferies Group.
Laplanche’s departure shook investors’ faith that the platform was among the strongest in the world of online lending. It also prompted more investors to examine whether the platform had become overly reliant on Wall Street banks that were looking for yield but are notoriously fickle customers.
Scott Sanborn, who took over as CEO and who’d served as the company’s chief operating officer prior, has taken drastic steps to get the company back on course, but none has had a meaningful impact just yet.
For example, in addition to hiring a new CFO, a new COO, a new general counsel and a new chief capital officer, Bloomberg reports that a separate new initiative hasn’t gone as well as hoped: providing loans to small businesses via partnerships with Alibaba and Alphabet.
Asked about that earlier today, Sanborn says that what “gives us confidence when I think about auto is that it’s not just leveraging our technical skills and learnings but also takes advantage of our marketing acquisition skills,” which he suggests Lending Club has been less able to do with its small loans program, given that it’s depending on partners for their distribution.
Sanborn also argues that though Lending Club has plenty of competition, the large auto lenders aren’t among its worries, given the relationships they have with car dealers, who would “generally lose some of that revenue” if auto lenders offered their customers refinancing options, too.
We’ll see soon enough whether Sanborn is right.
Lending Club will begin refinancing car loans for California consumers with FICO scores above 640, and whose cars are less than 7 years old and have been driven fewer than 80,000 miles. Sanborn says that interest rates for California customers will range from 2.49 percent to 19.99 percent, and that the average borrower could save $1,350 over the life of their loan.
Initially, the loans, which Sanborn says will range from $5,000 to $50,000, will be made off the company’s balance sheet. Eventually, he says, the program will be extended nationwide to a wider variety of borrowers, and it will be funded by the same sources of capital that currently provide personal loans to borrowers at Lending Club.
Asked about the widespread perception that those capital sources are largely Wall Street investors who’ve lost some of their appetite for Lending Club’s platform, Sanborn says that impression is wrong.
“If you look at the mix of investors who are funding these loans, a large base are individuals — some of them regular everyday people but also high-net-worth individuals,” he says. Meanwhile, a “considerable portion of [our lenders] are regional and community banks that have been pushed out of consumer lending because it’s a business of scale.” As for Wall Street, he calls it a “minority” source of Lending Club’s overall funding.
Sanborn also dismisses concerns over rising auto loan default rates that have prompted some banks to scale back and for regulators to voice concern about deteriorating underwriting standards. Fitch Ratings underscored the issue in a late August report that found that among subprime and deep subprime borrowers — meaning those with FICO scores of less than 600 — 4.6 percent are 60 days or more behind on their auto loan payments, a 17 percent increase from a year earlier.
That data won’t apply to Lending Club borrowers, says Sanborn. “When you hear about where credit has been overextended, that’s deep subprime, and that’s not where we’re focusing at all,” he says, calling current default rates “well within historic norms, even if 2016 doesn’t look as good as 2015.”

794,Apple could be developing its car OS in Canada,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/25/apple-could-be-developing-its-car-os-in-canada/,2016/10/25,"
More details about Apple’s software team for its not-so-secret car project are emerging. According to a new report from Bloomberg, Apple has hired quite a few engineers in the Ottawa suburb of Kanata. The company also opened an office there and could be developing its car operating system from there.
The reason why Kanata is so hot right now is because BlackBerry’s QNX office also happens to be there. QNX is an operating system for cars and runs many infotainment systems in major car brands, such as Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, GM, Ford and nearly everyone else.
Back in July, another report already indicated that QNX CEO Dan Dodge left the company to join Apple. Since then, around two dozen employees reportedly joined him, along with non-QNX employees.
According to Bloomberg, the team is working on an operating system for cars — and I certainly hope Apple calls it carOS. But it’s unclear if the team is focusing on the infotainment aspect or the software layer that is going to run the entire car.
Apple is now reportedly working on autonomous driving technology and not a full-fledged car. The idea is that Apple could partner with existing car manufacturers to integrate Apple’s technologies.
In addition to this strategy shift, Apple has yet to decide if the car project is viable. If Apple’s car team can’t build a promising demo before the end of 2017, the company could cancel the project.
As you can see, there are a lot of rumors going different ways about Project Titan. Apple could be hiring but also firing, Apple could be opening a new office but also reducing the scope of the project… If the car project is real, there’s one thing for sure: Apple doesn’t really know what it wants to do.

795,"2016 Lexus GS-F is fast, but not from the future",https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/25/2016-lexus-gs-f/,2016/10/25,"
It’s unfair to critique anything outside its purpose. You can’t judge a poem using essay criteria; you can’t pit the latest album from Leonard Cohen against Beyoncé. So you have to ask, even in reviewing a car, what its purpose is and does it succeed. The 2016 Lexus GS-F is meant to be a performance sedan, and in that it definitely succeeds.
But they gave it to me, an automotive tech and alternative fuels expert, to review. I write about the future of transportation, which is likely to be autonomous, less petroleum-based, and shared. This car had few ADAS features, ran only on gasoline, and there’s no way you’d want to share it if you owned it.
The F in the car’s name lets you know that this GS has been tuned by Lexus’s performance division. It’s got a 5-liter engine with 467 hp and 389 lb-ft of torque, and an 8-speed gearbox. Through the torque vectoring differential system, the driver can choose the appropriate setting for the driving at hand: normal, slalom, or track.
The Lexus Safety System with pre-collision included lane keeping assist and radar-based cruise control, but they did not work below 32 mph. The lane keeping assist provided some mild steering assistance, but mostly it blinked and beeped if you swerved across the line. There was no traffic jam assist or self-parking technology; it did have pedestrian detection, blind spot monitoring, and a rear cross-traffic alert, but those are all passive systems.
2016 Lexus GS-F instruments
The GS-F had an Eco mode, which isn’t that unusual. What was unusual, and what makes this car potentially worth the $86,770 price tag as tested, was that it was so easy to switch from Eco mode to Normal mode to Sport S or S+ mode. An on-the-fly twist of a knob in the center console was all it took to change the driving dynamics from saving fuel and driving responsibly to releasing the full-throated roar from under the hood.
That’s another surprise: the very un-Lexus-like sound of the engine. For a company that has long prided itself on silent engines and quiet cabins, I could definitely hear the growl of the engine, especially in sport mode. That’s because in either of the Sport modes, the car’s Active Sound Control “electronically synthesizes and assists the sound to the engine and the exhaust note in response to accelerator and shift lever operations, then disperses a sonic note via the speakers installed at the front and the rear of the cabin.” That plus the huge, aggressive grille made for a pretty badass drive.
So the GS-F succeeds in its purpose as a performance sedan, even though it isn’t taking many steps toward an autonomous, shared, electrified transportation future. But we’re not there yet, so you might as well have a blast while you can.

796,"Lyft picked up 17 million rides in October, up more than twice that amount from last year",https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/25/lyft-picked-up-17-million-rides-in-october-up-more-than-twice-that-amount-from-last-year/,2016/10/25,"
Lyft launched an aggressive marketing campaign in Spring that seems to be paying off. The rideshare company says it delivered 17 million rides this month (so far), more than 2.4x’s the amount the company did at the same time last year.
Data from research firm 7Park also shows Lyft gaining in U.S. market share on Uber year over year in major metropolitan areas where Uber has dominated since 2014.

Lyft's ambitious future vision includes self-driving dominance by 2021
Cruise founder Kyle Vogt on why he joined forces with GM


 It’s still just a drop in the bucket when compared to its rival, though. Uber has the lion’s share of the U.S. market at 5 million rides per day — and that’s just a fraction of Chinese counterpart Didi Chuxing, which claims 20 million rides per day.
But it’s a nod to the rocket ship of growth Lyft has set itself up for. The company took in $1 billion in funding last December — half coming from its buddy in business General Motors — and Lyft’s John Zimmer said on stage at the Wall Street Journal Live conference it’s enough to at least “break even” on its bold plan for the future.
Lyft and GM have been very cozy since the start of the investment relationship, intertwining business offerings across both platforms and there has been some speculation GM might have offered to buy Lyft. Lyft confirmed it hired boutique investment firm Qatalyst but reportedly declined GM’s acquisition offer.
However, Zimmer denied Lyft was for sale in the past or was for sale now but did admit there was an offer on the table and that was the impetus for hiring Qatalyst. “We have a fiduciary duty to take in-bound inquiries seriously,” he said.
Zimmer teased there would be more branding changes in the near future, including possibly getting rid of the famous bright pink mustache, though he wouldn’t nail down exactly what we could expect there.
He also mentioned Lyft will get to China soon enough but says the Didi crossover deal is still in place so riders there can use the Didi app to hail a ride from Lyft. Zimmer says the API isn’t live yet for U.S. riders but added it will be soon, which could potentially pose a data-sharing issue with a company that has now invested in its biggest competition.
Zimmer brushed the data issue off and said Lyft has rules in place to limit the kind of data Didi will have access to.
Zimmer also seems pretty confident about Lyft’s near future use of autonomous vehicles and said you can expect to see the majority of Lyft cars without a steering wheel in the next five years.
That conviction is likely fueled by Lyft’s cozy relationship with GM, which is working on self-driving technology and purchased automated driving tech startup Cruise earlier this year. But also the need to cut costs (and worker wages) out of the equation to maximize profit.
But don’t expect to see this company go public anytime soon. Zimmer’s company is a mere four years old and growing like mad. And, as Zimmer pointed out, Lyft gets offered capital every few months.
Though he didn’t think he’d need to raise funds again before any IPO happened, he didn’t rule out the possibility. “Never say never,” he said.

For those doubting that autonomous vehicles are going to be driving alongside humans very soon, consider the first delivery made by Otto while a driver actually left the driver’s seat during the long highway portion of the trip: The Uber-owned self-driving transport truck company made its first delivery recently, moving 50,000 cans of Budweiser from Fort Collins, CO to Colorado Springs.
The inaugural delivery saw the truck’s human driver navigate the city portions of the trip, letting the experienced professional handle foot traffic, stop signs with busy intersections and other unpredictables like people walking dogs, and then took over once the rig had successfully merged onto Interstate 25, handling the relatively simple highway drive for 120 miles, while the Otto’s driver actually left his seat, since the truck is capable of full Level 4 autonomy while on the highway, keeping distance between itself and cars ahead, and changing lanes very rarely when the system decides it absolutely has to do so.
Otto’s technology includes $30,000 worth of additional hardware that can work with any big rig that uses an automatic transition. Six test trucks are in place in the Bay area, continually running trials while tweaking software. The company’s also addressing a big need – current estimates put truck driver numbers at almost 50,000 below the actual demand, and the lack of qualified people willing to do the job is actually widening.
Uber acquired Otto last summer and has said it will continue to run the company as a separate brand. Expect to see its self-driving tech start becoming a much more common site on actual roads long before we see autonomous personal consumer cars with any kind of regularity.

798,NHTSA releases best practice guidelines for vehicle cybersecurity,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/24/nhtsa-releases-best-practice-guidelines-for-vehicle-cybersecurity/,2016/10/24,"
Following its release of guidelines for automakers regarding self-driving cars, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has released a similar set of guidelines or “best practices” for cybersecurity in vehicles, designed to provide guidance for car makers.
The best practices document is 22 pages and is non-binding, meaning there’s no regulatory imperative requiring that car makers meet these standards. The stated purpose of the document is to help improve car security in the face of hacking attempts and to encourage auto manufacturers to proactively incorporate this kind of thinking in their efforts as a matter of course.
It’s aimed at anyone making a motor vehicle, including individuals and organizations like suppliers, car makers and aftermarket service providers and alteration shops. The basics include recommending a “layered approach,” which will prioritize the security of critical systems over less safety-specific features, and also encourages information sharing in “as close to real time as possible” in the case of cybersecurity events. The mechanism for this sharing is the Automotive Information Sharing and Analysis Center, which NHTSA encouraged car makers to create jointly, and which it will now encourage to expand membership to suppliers and others involved in cybersecurity maintenance and practice.
A request for data sharing around critical events is also a core component of NHTSA’s autonomous driving guidelines, and it’s obvious in both cases that the government agency wants the entire industry to learn from incidents that pose a lot of potential risk. The guidelines also encourage disclosure of any discovery of potential vulnerabilities, as well as retention of data related to self-audits, which include attempts by car makers to test their own systems for vulnerabilities.

799,Chronocam secures $15M to power its ‘biological eye’ computer vision system,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/24/chronocam-secures-15m-to-power-its-biological-eye-computer-vision-system/,2016/10/24,"
Not everything in our field of view at any given time is all that interesting; often, it’s only when something consistent changes that our eyes take notice.
Paris-based Chronocam is looking to further develop this concept in the computer vision space with its new camera technology being optimized for autonomous vehicles.
Today, Chronocam announced that it has picked up $15 million in a Series B funding round led by Intel Capital. Robert Bosch Venture Capital, iBionex, GmbH, 360 Capital, CEAi and Renault Group also participated in the round. The company had previously raised an $850,000 seed round.
Computer vision is a space where Intel is continuing to make significant moves. Intel announced last month that it is acquiring computer vision VPU-maker Movidius, which has become popular largely for how well it does low-power on-device processing. The company’s RealSense team has also done quite a bit of work in building sensors for autonomous cars, drones and virtual reality systems.
Computer vision companies are increasingly looking to take image processing back from the cloud and get everything happening on-device so that the data can be interpreted as quickly as possible. Chronocam is particularly great for this on-device processing because its systems grab nearly 20 times less data than a standard camera system.
The camera works by analyzing the captured image on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Most of the static information captured on devices isn’t really important until something changes. For autonomous cars, knowing everything about the scope, brightness and color of the sky isn’t important until there’s a sudden storm and hail is dropping out of the sky.
“Conventional computer vision approaches are not well-suited to the requirements of a new generation of vision-enabled systems,” said Luca Verre, CEO and co-founder of Chronocam, in a statement. “For example, autonomous vehicles require faster sensing systems which can operate in a wider variety of ambient conditions. In the IoT segment, power budgets, bandwidth requirements and integration within sensor networks make today’s vision technologies impractical and ineffective.”
Chronocam plans to package this computer vision technology into a full end-to-end system, which it hopes to ship next year.

Henrik Fisker is back with a new electric car company, Fisker, Inc., which has emerged from two years of operating in stealth mode. Now, we have our first teasing look at the new Fisker electric vehicle, thanks to a shadowy image of the car’s front end. The image shows a car that’s quite different looking from the original Karma created by the original Fisker Automotive, which eventually had its assets purchased by Chinese autopart maker Wanxiang.
The new Fisker front-end shows a very aerodynamic design, with a centrally placed radar and camera sensor combo, which Fisker says is designed to be used for safety features, setting the groundwork for potential autonomous capabilities in the future. The car also has adaptive LED front lighting, with two angled headlamps which provide most of the illumination is the dimly lit overall scene.
The new Fisker car has also been shown to have butterfly doors in a previous, similarly mysterious teaser shot. The car will also have a 400-mile maximum range, the company has said.

Driverless technology moved closer to becoming an everyday reality last week in the U.S. thanks to Tesla, but in Singapore it’s already expanding from testing with taxis to testing with full-size city buses in real-world situations. The new bus program will see two electric hybrid buses begin to ferry passengers between Nanyang Technological University and CleanTech Park, and potentially even beyond to Pioneer MRT station.
You can see those respective trips in context in the Google Maps embeds below, but both are relatively short sprints. The route between the school and CleanTech Park has already been operating with a test involving smaller self-driving electric shuttles, since a pilot began there in 2013.
The route to the light rail station is longer and involves more navigation of everyday city traffic, however, and the test has the ultimate aim of “improv[ing] road safety, reduc[ing] vehicle congestion, alleviat[ing] pollution and address[ing] manpower challenges,” NTU VP of Research Lam Khin Long told ChannelNews Asia, so you can expect that if its successful trials in other parts of Singapore will follow.

802,5 supercar secrets starring the 2017 McLaren 570GT,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/20/5-supercar-secrets-starring-the-2017-mclaren-570gt/,2016/10/20,"
Supercars are called super for a reason: these are not everyday sedans. They’re more powerful, more strikingly designed, and more expensive than the cars we usually drive to work. But there are some things you probably don’t know about supercars. I’ll use the 2017 McLaren 570GT to illustrate.

You can’t just get in and out. Here’s how to enter and exit a supercar with doors that open up, like the McLaren’s scissor doors. Put your right foot in, glide into the form-fitting seat, and then bring in your left foot. Reach up to close the door. On exiting, reverse the process: left foot out, rise from the seat, and then bring your right foot out.
There’s a “frunk.” That’s a totally unofficial term for “front trunk.” Since the McLaren’s 3.8-liter turbo V8 is behind the seats, as it is in many supercars, most of the usable storage is actually up front.
The frunk

They ride real low. Speed bumps, driveway entrances — just about everything is in danger of scraping the bottom of a supercar. McLaren has added the ability to lift and lower the chassis at the touch of a lever to save the undercarriage in town and increase aerodynamics at speed.
They have wonderful, mostly useless, sound systems. My test McLaren had the optional Bowers & Wilkins stereo installed, and it sounded great the couple of times I used it. Supercar engineers make an effort to tune the engine’s sound, and I didn’t want their efforts to go to waste.
The things you think are standard, like a place to put your purse or a cup of coffee, are not. The cup holder in the 570GT is tucked underneath the center console, kind of by your ankle. The designers did thoughtfully design the rear hatch to open from the side rather than the bottom, making it easier to use the extra storage near the engine on the “touring deck.”
McLaren GT570 storage


The takeaway here is that supercars, even “the most practical model ever launched by McLaren Automotive,” are exceptional. They are built for people who view driving as a pleasure, not a task to be endured. These are for owners who are willing to pay $215,000 in the case of the 570GT to hear the engine wind through the twisties all the way to the cabin in the mountains. These drivers are not bringing huge coolers or entire wardrobes along. So while supercars are not very good for mundane chores like getting groceries, picking up one kid after school in the 570GT would be certifiably awesome — as long as their backpack isn’t too big.

803,Automatic launches a new lower cost connected car adapter,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/20/automatic-launches-a-new-lower-cost-connected-car-adapter/,2016/10/20,"
Automatic went for a more expensive, but more full-featured offering with the 3G-enabled Automatic Pro earlier this year, but the new Automatic Lite delivers a more affordable connected car device with Bluetooth connectivity, at a lower price point than any previous hardware they’ve released.
The new Automatic Lite is $79.95, and will sell at Best Buy, Amazon and Automatic’s own site. The Lite carries no subscription, unlike the Automatic Pro which offers no subscription for connectivity for five years included in the $129.95 purchase price, but makes no specific promises after that. Lite connects to your phone and the new Automatic driving app via Bluetooth, and uses your device’s data connection to communicate with other apps and services.
The Automatic Lite sounds very similar to the original Automatic in terms of what kinds of fear it offers, connecting to your car’s OBD-II port and providing information about engine lights, should any appear on your dash, helping you locate mechanics, tracking trips for easy expensing and locating filling stations and tracking gas costs, too. The new hardware also supports Automatic’s expanding app ecosystem, which includes a number of third-party software optimized to use the data gathered from your car.
Automatic clearly wants to cover the spread here with a range that targets both price-sensitive and convenience-seeking customers. The gap of $50 still seems a little narrow to me, but they are obviously looking to optimize the pricing on the low-end. Cost of entry for this kind of aftermarket add-on is a key sticking point, since many drivers probably aren’t feeling that anything’s necessarily “missing” without these features, so any price savings is likely to attract a fair number of new potential users.

804,Watch this autonomous Tesla drive from home to work on its own,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/20/watch-this-autonomous-tesla-drive-from-home-to-work-on-its-own/,2016/10/20,"

Tesla announced Wednesday evening that all Tesla cars made from now on will have all the hardware they need on board to achieve full self-driving (though autonomous software will rollout later, with a cross-country demo planned for the end of 2017). Tesla’s already doing its own early testing, of course, and the video above shows a vehicle with fully autonomous capabilities navigating city and freeway streets with apparent ease.
The Tesla takes itself out of the garage, leaves the city, takes the highway, exits and arrives at Tesla HQ, after which it parks itself. A safety driver is behind the wheel while the car is on city streets as required by law, but the vehicle is driverless at the very end of the video after it drops off its “driver” and parallel parks itself – stopping for a crossing pedestrian in the process. As noted by Elon Musk on Twitter, it even skips a spot designated for vehicles with disabled parking permits, because it recognizes it’s not allowed to park there.
Even this early look is noteworthy because the Tesla system is handling one of the most challenging driving environments; highway driving is relatively easy, since it’s mostly straight and there’s very little in the way of unusual stops, blind corners or pedestrians. A city is basically replete with edge cases, which represent the greatest challenge for any self-driving software.
Musk even said that when this is available to drivers, they’ll be able to hit “Summon” on their phone via the Tesla app to call the car to them once they want to get driving again – even if they happen to be across the country from their vehicle.


When you want your car to return, tap Summon on your phone. It will eventually find you even if you are on the other side of the country

805,Musk targeting coast-to-coast test drive of fully self-driving Tesla by late 2017,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/19/musk-targeting-coast-to-coast-test-drive-of-fully-self-driving-tesla-by-late-2017/,2016/10/19,"
Elon Musk is really accelerating the potential timeline for delivering self-driving: The Tesla CEO said on a press call that he hopes to deliver a test ride of fully autonomous Tesla vehicle driving by next year.
What kind of test? Not a trip around the block, but a coast-to-coast road trip, he says.
“Our goal is, and I feel pretty good about this goal, that we’ll be able to do a demonstration drive of full autonomy all the way from LA to New York, from home in LA to let’s say dropping you off in Time Square in New York, and then having the car go park itself, by the end of next year,” he said on a press call today. “Without the need for a single touch, including the charger.”
To put that kind of accomplishment in perspective, current autonomous testing generally doesn’t even cross state lines, let alone the country. It’s a huge goal, and one that will potentially be replicable by every car Tesla makes between now and then, according to the new hardware and vehicle system updates Musk also announced today.

806,All Tesla cars built from today on have all hardware needed for full self-driving,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/19/all-tesla-cars-built-from-now-on-have-everything-onboard-for-full-self-driving/,2016/10/19,"
Elon Musk revealed the Model 3 in March, revealing details of the $35,000 base model including a sub-six second 0-60 time and a minimum 215 mile range. The basic picture of the Model 3 inspired a pre-order frenzy unlike anything seen previously in the car world, but now Musk has dropped what he referred to earlier as Part 2 of the Model 3 unveiling after a lengthy pause, as promised, and it’s a doozy.
Musk announced that all Tesla cars being produced as of today, including the Model 3, will have everything they need onboard to achieve full Level 5 self-driving in the future. The news means that every Tesla vehicle, including the Model S and X as well as Model 3 cars made after today will eventually be able to achieve full autonomous driving, with what Tesla refers to as “a safety level substantially greater than that of a human driver” via nothing more than a software update at some point in the future.
The hardware required to make this possible includes a sensor loadout complete with eight surround optical cameras, which can see up to 250 meters out from the vehicle on all sides, and a dozen ultrasonic sensors to assist the optical system. These are capable of twice the range of previous hardware, and can detect both “hard and soft objects” according to the company. Also included is the radar hardware that provides forward-facing detection of hazards even through potentially obfuscating conditions.
The biggest change might be the new onboard computer that provides over 40 times the processing power of the existing Tesla hardware, which actually runs the in-house neural net the car maker has developed in order to handle processing of data inbound from the vision, sonar and radar systems. Musk said on call discussing the most recent update to the existing driver assistance Autopilot software that it basically stretched computing power to the limit, which is why the upgraded CPU is required for full Level 5 autonomy. The new GPU is the Nvidia Titan, Musk said on the call, though it was a “tight call” between Nvidia and AMD.
The validation required for full autonomy will still take some more time, but Musk said on a call that it’s actually already looking like it’ll be at least two times as safe as human driving based on existing testing.
While it’s being developed, the self-driving system will operate in the background in “shadow mode,” essentially working virtually behind the scenes in order to demonstrate where it would’ve been able to avoid accidents that a person driving could not.
While the hardware will be included in all Tesla cars made from now on, which includes the Model 3, it will be an $8,000 add-on for vehicles to enable the software.
The reason for building in full autonomy capability across the lineup, according to Musk, is entirely to increase driving safety and reduce traffic-related accidents. Musk spoke passionately about this aim going so far as to admonish broad media coverage of Autopilot-related accidents, while the ongoing and persistent issue of human-fault car deaths receives far less attention from press.
In fact, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reported sharp increases in traffic deaths in both 2015 and 2016, and asked for help parsing the data to determine the causes of the rise. And when the Department of Transportation released its federal guidelines for autonomous driving technology, it also strongly indicated that the government believes autonomy in vehicles will ultimately lead to safer roads.
Musk said in a conference call in August regarding Tesla’s advancements in creating a car with Level 4 autonomous capability that “what we’ve got will blow people’s minds, it blows my mind,” and added that “it’ll come sooner than people think.” He’s certainly delivered with today’s announcement.

807,Faraday Future says it’s finally going to show us a real car at CES,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/19/faraday-future-says-its-finally-going-to-show-us-a-real-car-at-ces/,2016/10/19,"
The concept car is basically always a vehicle of pure puffery, and carmakers go above and beyond when it comes to teasing the future. But few are as accomplished on this scale as Faraday Future, the master illusionist of electric vehicles. The company says it’s finally going to show us something worthy of the label “production,” however, at CES in January. CES, which is basically the annual global festival of vaporware.
Last year, Faraday went for the concept angle hard, with the FFZERO1, an insane sports car that’s about as far away from a shipping vehicle as you can get while still getting to call the thing a car. But now it’s ready to “unveil the future,” the company says, with a reveal of a car it seems intent on shipping at the annual consumer electronics mega show in Vegas.

What will that car look like? Faraday says it’ll be a “premium electric” car that “combines extreme technology, industry leading range, and holistic design” but it isn’t saying much beyond that. Spy shots have captured a car that looks like a Model X-style urban SUV, however, and that does look like it shares traits with the supposed test vehicles spotted earlier.

Basically, don’t hold your breath for an imminent launch from Faraday, going on their past performance. But if they do come out with a car that’s actually going to be available for people to buy and drive in the relatively near future, expect a lot more astonishment than when they revealed their 3D Batmobile fan art.

You’re a train conductor speeding along when you suddenly see five people tied up on the tracks in front of you. You don’t have enough time to stop, but you do have enough time to switch to an alternate track. That’s when you see there’s one person tied up on the alternate track. Do you pull the lever to make the switch, or stay the course?
Any college graduate who has ever stepped foot in an introductory philosophy course is likely to recognize this problem immediately. The question is a classic jumping off point for discussions about utilitarianism, consequentialism and fairness. Subsequent twists on the question — what if the one person standing on the other track was a child? — come with new moral dilemmas and further abstract discussions. There is no clear correct answer. In this ambiguity lies conversation.
The tech community as a collective whole is now facing a similar conundrum when it comes to programming machines. This time, though, the philosophical decisions aren’t theoretical — and nobody will be saved by the bell. With the advent of smart machines with learning capabilities powered by artificial intelligence, we need to reach a final consensus for a very practical purpose: We need to teach robots how to be moral.
Philosophical theory is now reality
The situation today is marked by groups of computer engineers sitting around discussing age-old philosophical problems. Artificial intelligence is advancing at an unprecedented rate due to affordable computational power and a concentrated focus on the field by tech giants such as Google, Facebook and IBM. Industry insiders predict that self-driving cars will edge onto the roads in five years, and drones are currently permeating everything from the industrial supply chain to farming. Questions about morality are becoming more urgent, yet remain unsolved.
Many industry leaders are asking questions, but few are stepping forward with clear and specific proposals.
Perhaps most surprising is that defining answers in regards to philosophical judgments, at least for now, is being left up to the tech community. In the 2016 policy statement concerning automated vehicles, released jointly by the Department of Transportation and the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration, even the government organizations themselves seemed apt to admit that they simply don’t have the expertise nor the authority to create comprehensive legislation, noting that “it is becoming clear that existing NHTSA authority is likely insufficient to meet the needs of the time.” Companies like Google are practically begging for guidance and official regulations so they can move forward, but are coming up empty-handed.
A well-considered delay
Given the financial rewards of being first to market, there is certainly an urgency involved in coming to final conclusions. Yet even those who stand to benefit the most appear to be holding back. Many industry leaders are asking questions, but few are stepping forward with clear and specific proposals.
That’s a good thing. Despite newfound abilities to advance intelligent technology quickly, industry leaders should not give in to pressures to move at an unhealthy pace. Questions should come first, otherwise the industry releases poorly considered intelligence, which is a recipe for chaos.
Take, for example, an autonomous car self-driving along the road when another car comes flying through an intersection. The imminent t-bone crash has a 90 percent chance of killing the self-driving car’s passenger, as well as the other driver. If it swerves to the left, it’ll hit a child crossing the street with a ball. If it swerves to the right, it’ll hit an old woman crossing the street in a wheelchair.
Autonomous cars are sure to face this type of challenge at some point, and their creators need to decide how to program them to react to these no-win situations. Engineers need to come up with clear rules for navigating difficult situations so the robots don’t get confused and malfunction or select the wrong decision.
The easy answer would be to protect the driver at all costs. If we can assume that drivers are all selfish and would always default to the action that contains the least risk for them, wouldn’t we just replicate that in the autonomous driver model? The very fact that the decision to date has not proved easy is a good sign.

The morals of the masses
Ultimately, no matter what the experts decide, any final product and its underlying moral code must be palatable to the public at large if autonomous cars are to be a success. The MIT Media lab, whose scientists I had the privilege to spend time with at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos earlier this year, are struggling with how to make moral robots. One thing was very clear — there is no clear answer.
They have created a Moral Machine website tool that gives us insight as to what, exactly, the public expects and wants from autonomous cars. The website invites users to judge between two competing outcomes in an inevitable car crash, with more than a dozen different scenarios to judge.
The most advanced technology isn’t going to be released until we as a society figure out collective answers to these puzzling questions. 
Overall, the results showed that people strongly prefer utilitarian outcomes: the fewest total number of lives lost. These results align with other surveys where participants consistently say that a more utilitarian model for autonomous cars is a more moral one.
Herein lies the trouble: While people favor utilitarianism in the abstract, their feelings become muddied when they’re the ones who might be making the sacrifice. As reported by The Washington Post, just 21 percent of people surveyed said they were likely to buy an autonomous vehicle whose moral choices were regulated, compared to 59 percent of respondents who said they were likely to make the purchase if the vehicles were instead instructed to always save the driver’s life.

Philosophy hits the road
In an age when technology and decreased face-to-face interaction is blamed for causing people to feel dispassionate and disconnected from one another, the very fact that the discussion on robot morality is so vibrant is a clear demonstration that compassion is alive and well.

In 1942, Isaac Asimov provided one prevailing take on robot morality with the three laws of robotics featured in his famous novel I, Robot. His outline was simple: A robot may not injure a human being, or through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. But, as the characters discover in the novel, sometimes harm is simply unavoidable. What if the question instead mutates to what is preferable, letting the young or old live or sacrificing one to save many?
The most advanced technology isn’t going to be released until we as a society figure out collective answers to these puzzling questions. Governments around the world will look to the United States to set a regulatory precedent, and we need to make sure that we get things right the first time around. These are important discussions, and government leaders, tech leaders and ordinary citizens must all have a say, so that as a society, we maintain a moral system of checks and balances. There is no putting the genie back in the bottle.

809,Tesla’s upcoming announcement is Part 2 of the Model 3 reveal,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/19/teslas-upcoming-announcement-is-part-2-of-the-model-3-reveal/,2016/10/19,"
Tesla is announcing some news today, and now we have a better idea of what it will be: Elon Musk has revealed that the news will go live around 5 PM PT today, and that it’ll be about “Model 3 part 2,” the follow-up to the original Model 3 unveiling back in March.
Musk said there would be a “part 2” unveiling event nearer to the beginning of production on the Model 3 back when the car was first made official. Then in an interview at Code Conference in June, Musk hesitated onstage during an interview when asked if the Model 3 would be offer fully self-driving features, and eventually deferred to an event “maybe toward the end of the year” during which more info would be made public.


@elonmusk This is also what I was alluding to by Model 3 part 2
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 19, 2016



That definitely gives us an idea of what to expect from this afternoon’s news. Some speculation has already suggested we’ll see a full successor to Autopilot unveiled, featuring far more advanced autonomy; tying these features to a Model 3 with full Level 4 autonomy (capable of self-driving without any human intervention) would definitely make sense given Musk’s previous comments, including a prediction made by the Tesla CEO in late 2015 that full autonomy would be available in around two years’ time.
We’ll bring you Tesla’s news as it happens, so tune in at around 5 PM PT to find out for sure what Musk reveals.

If you’re kind of an ass when you drive, autonomous cars are going to be great for you, a new study from the London School of Economics and Goodyear has found (via GeekWire). Basically, self-driving cars will opt on the side of safety and caution, which means aggressive jerks who drive like morons will be able to bully them all over the road.
The study found that, surprisingly, drivers who tend to be more aggressive (and therefore among the least likely to want to give up control to a robot, especially a weak robot that’s a huge wimp when it comes to wanting not to terrify people or run them down) are actually those who favor an autonomous future, because in that world they can count on most of the soft baby bot cars to get out of the way when they careen toward them unsafely in order to assert their sad, pathetic, frustrated dominance.
This is fine, because the people in those self-driving cars likely won’t notice because they’ll be enjoying life instead of stressing about having to defensively drive in order to deal with huge jerks weaving in and out of traffic on the freeway.
It’s also fine because any enjoyment of their dickish driving will be short-lived, since autonomous cars sharing the roadway with human-driven vehicles is probably going to be very short-lived, especially once we have more data to back-up the safety advantages of self-driving cars. Aggro drivers could also hasten their own demise, if they end up causing accidents trying to bully the bots. Enjoy your sunset, road warriors.

811,Evercar abruptly shuts down,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/18/evercar-abruptly-shuts-down/,2016/10/18,"
On September 7, 2016, Evercar sent out a press release announcing that it had expanded from its Los Angeles home base to San Francisco and Oakland and had financing for buying up to 3,000 vehicles in the next year. Almost exactly a month later, the service that rented EVs and hybrids to drivers for ride hailing services shut down. The company had launched at the 2015 Los Angeles Auto Show, with plans to expand nationwide by the end of 2016. What happened?
The first official word came via Facebook, where Evercar posted on October 10: “As of today, Evercar is suspending its on-demand car share operations in Los Angeles and San Francisco.” The same message was posted on the company’s Twitter profile. There wasn’t much blowback on social media. Most of the comments came from drivers who would miss having easy access to Nissan Leafs. For what it’s worth, the company has a 5-star rating from full-time employees on Glassdoor.com; the only cons mentioned were funding related.
An SF Gate report quoted an Evercar spokesperson as saying the business was taking a break while it “pursues strategic options.” An email sent to customers and posted on the Evercar website cited “unforeseen circumstances” that kept them from providing the hourly rental service “in the near term.”
The company’s PR firm couldn’t clarify what went wrong. It responded to an email with a simple, “Unfortunately, we have no information on Evercar at this time.”
Evercar rented its cars to drivers for ride-hailing services like Lyft and Uber and on-demand delivery services like Postmates for $5-$8 an hour, depending on the rented car and service area.
The problem seems to be that it was financing those cars through a third party, which made it difficult to compete with the short-term rental services Uber and Lyft already offer their drivers. Uber also offers a long-term leasing option, and Lyft has partnered with GM to provide eligible vehicles to drivers at little to no cost, depending on the number of rides given.

The pre-order page has previously listed late 2017 as a start date for shipping.
We’ve confirmed that this new timeline for shipping applies to orders from now onward, and does not impact estimated shipping for prior orders. The website also says that production will begin in late 2017, which is in keeping with previous information provided by the company.
Pre-orders from Tesla number well above 400,000 at this point, as the carmaker confirmed passing that threshold back in June, so it’s logical that the company would update the anticipated delivery timelines for new customers looking to place a reservation for the all-electric, $35,000 sedan.

At the Paris Motor Show earlier this month, Renault-Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn seemed to suggest his company would do more assembling of third-party technologies than creation of their own, but a new internal startup initiative announced by the combined automaker aims to make it directly responsible for some of its most basic technologies related to connected cars and the future of mobility.
The new group will be led by Renault-Nissan SVP Ogi Redzic, a HERE veteran, and will include 300 team members to start, featuring personnel with backgrounds in software, cloud tech, data analytics, machine learning and more.
Nissan recently made an acquisition which brings a bunch of talent in those areas on board, picking up cloud software integration expert and developer Sylpheo. A dedicated in-house team assigned to furthering Nissan-Renault’s progress in this growing area of interest for automakers should help the combined company keep up with rivals who are focusing a lot of time, money and product development into mobility services, which include things like autonomous fleets, car sharing services and other vehicle ownership alternatives.
Aside from developing core technologies to help propel Renault-Nissan into the next era of transportation, the new division is also responsible for helping the giant carmaker thing more like a startup. That’s a difficult task even at large tech companies where that’s always been a virtue, but it’s clearly a trend in the industry to try to inject some entrepreneurial spirit in legacy firms chasing tech advances.

814,Snapsheet raises $20 million for app to help drivers file claims after a crash,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/17/snapsheet-raises-20-million-for-app-to-help-drivers-file-claims-after-a-crash/,2016/10/17,"
A Chicago-based startup called Snapsheet has raised a Series C round of $20 million to make life easier for people who have been through a car crash.
The company’s cloud-based software is used by auto insurance providers to guide users through a photo- and information-gathering process on the scene of an accident. It is basically white labeled as a mobile app for each auto insurance provider. On the back end, Snapsheet helps the insurance providers virtually process claims without having to send an adjuster to inspect a vehicle.
The startup’s Series C funding came, in part, from big names in the insurance world. The deal was led by F-Prime Capital and IA Capital Group, and joined by strategic backers Fosun Insurance Group, Liberty Mutual Strategic Ventures, Intact Financial Corp. and USAA. The startup has been working with new school insurance carriers like MetroMile and Turo, and has racked up 35 corporate clients so far, according to a company statement.
Snapsheet President CJ Przybyl said claims handling is becoming more sophisticated, thanks to technology like smartphones, crowdsourced photos, telematics and machine learning. It’s integrating all the technology it can into its platform to help insurance providers process claims more quickly, to get their customers paid as soon as possible and back in safe, repaired vehicles. The company will use its new funding for product development, and hiring especially in client support, sales and marketing roles he said.
Although he acknowledged that software like Snapsheet’s could be put to use to help other insurance providers analyze damage to homes or other property, Przybyl said auto claims represent such a huge market, the company won’t seek to expand beyond autos.
“Insurance tech is winner take most for players that really stay focused and understand how important customer service is,” he said.
Snapsheet investor and F-Prime Partner Ben Malka said one big reason his firm backed the company is the effect its technology has on the customers of auto insurance providers.
“People who use Snapsheet in conjunction with their carriers claims process end up with a superior customer experience. NPS scores are significantly better most other claims resolution methods,” he said, referencing the “net promoter scores” of auto insurance providers.
Additionally, he said, Snapsheet is tapping into new willingness on the part of insurance companies to use tech for a competitive advantage. “The insurance sector is embracing innovation more forcefully than in years past,” he said.
Przybyl said one thing Snapsheet intends to develop, given the funding, is machine learning that can predict what a customer’s questions might be, before they ask them, about filing a claim or the status of a claim. With that kind of system in place, the Snapsheet-powered app can deliver information to a customer before they have become anxious about finding it, he said.

815,Apple reportedly doesn’t want to build a car anymore — just its brain,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/17/apple-reportedly-doesnt-want-to-build-a-car-anymore-just-its-brain/,2016/10/17,"
Apple has been working on a not-so-secret car project for years. Project Titan, as it is called internally, has already gone through a bunch of leadership and roadmap changes. According to a new report from Bloomberg, the company is now scrapping plans to build an electric car. The car team is focusing on autonomous driving technology instead.
Even more intriguing, it looks like Apple is having second-thoughts about becoming a car company as the company has set a clear deadline. If Apple’s car team can’t build a promising demo before the end of 2017, then the company will cancel the project.
Initially, the company wanted to build a traditional Apple product, with the company controlling both the hardware and software components. Apple planned to ship its electric car with self-driving technology after 2020.
But Apple has scaled back these ambitions. According to Bloomberg, hundreds of engineers have been reassigned or let go because Apple doesn’t want to build an electric car anymore. Apple plans to partner with existing car makers instead — think more like Android and less like the iPhone. And of course, Apple could decide to build a car after all — just not for now.
Long-time Apple executive Bob Mansfield is now leading the project. Bloomberg says he’s one of the main reasons why Apple is shifting its strategy when it comes to cars. That’s why employees left in August and in September.
While there’s a lot of hype around self-driving technology, it’s going to be a long and winding road before you can buy a fully autonomous self-driving car. It’s a multi-year, capital-intensive project with many obstacles. If a company doesn’t have the right technology, engineers and strategy, then it could end up being a costly mistake. That’s why Apple is treading carefully.
And yet, it’s hard to say if focusing on autonomous driving technology is the right strategy. Some companies, such as Tesla, plan to build a full-stack self-driving car. Other companies, such as Uber, plan to partner with car manufacturers and build self-driving kits. Existing car manufacturers, such as Renault-Nissan, plan to partner with tech companies so that they can focus on building cars.
Nobody knows the winning strategy yet. But there’s one thing for sure. Given the fierce competition, companies need to invest now so that they’re well-positioned when it comes to autonomous cars a few years down the road. Is Apple investing too much or too little on its car project? It’s hard to say for now.

Tesla has moved a new product launch that had been planned for today to next Wednesday, according to CEO Elon Musk.
In a tweet Musk said whatever it is “needs a few more days of refinement” — although it’s not clear whether the extra polish is needed on the announcement or the product itself.


Moving the Tesla announcement to Wednesday. Needs a few more days of refinement.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 16, 2016



Earlier this month Musk trailed a new product that he asserted would be “unexpected by most”, with the unveiling due to take place on October 17, ahead of a separate Tesla/SolarCity announcement planned for October 28.
Speculation about what the unexpected Tesla product might be has included a new vehicle — perhaps a Roadster 2.0 — or improvements to the company’s driver assistance technology, Autopilot, with suggestions it’s been making significant progress there.
If it’s an update to the driver assistance system it’s possible the postponement to the announcement is related to criticism of the tech in Germany — which stepped up this weekend with the Transport Minister intervening directly via a letter to Tesla requesting it stop using the term ‘Autopilot’ in its marketing.
Earlier this month a study from Germany’s Federal Highway Research Institute also dubbed the Autopilot feature of the Tesla Model S a “considerable traffic hazard”. That report also criticized the company’s use of the term ‘Autopilot’ to describe a driver assistance technology.
Still, it’s equally possible the new product is something else entirely. Either way, Tesla fans only have a couple more days to wait to find out.

Maven, a car sharing company out of General Motors, is driving its way into San Francisco today. The announcement made late Thursday evening is one part of a continued roll-out in several cities throughout the U.S., which started at the beginning of this year.
It’s city based car sharing service called Maven City is now available in nine cities throughout the nation, joining Lyft’s new driver rental program Lyft Express Drive, which was introduced this summer.

GM Unveils Maven, Its Big New Play In Car-Sharing Services


GM has been cozy with Lyft for a while and added a whopping half a billion dollars to its last funding round. There have also been rumors the major car manufacturer was in talks to buy the rideshare company.
Maven says about 10,500 Maven members and Lyft drivers have used Express Drive so far, logging nearly 15 million miles between them.
But there are plenty of other ways to get around in the City by the Bay – Lyft, Uber, MUNI and taxis among them. And Maven will also be competing with older, more established car-sharing outfits. Getaround has been around since 2009 and the even older Zipcar — which was scooped up by Avis — launched in the year 2000.
Maven started rolling out a one-way rental service in late September, allowing drivers to pick up a car in one place and drive it to the next destination without needing to return it. But Zipcar has also been offering a one-way service for a while.
Still, Maven believes it will stand out in S.F., especially among the tech crowd. “Maven’s blend of new cars with seamless technology provides a fully connected car sharing experience that helps bring our members closer to the experiences, places and people they love,” Maven’s VP of urban mobility Julia Steyn said of the expansion to San Francisco.
Maven uses your smartphone to unlock and access the vehicle. Some of the other car sharing services do this, too. But unlike Getaround or other peer-to-peer car sharing, Maven uses GM’s cars and can thus offer high-tech integrations like Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, OnStar, SiriusXM radio and 4G LTE wireless connectivity.
Maven says for $8 an hour you can rent any of its 60 tech-savvy vehicles placed in busy areas throughout the city (compare that to Getaround, which starts at $5 an hour and goes up from there, depending on the car).
But will these tech offerings entice San Franciscans to use the service? It certainly makes the experience more enjoyable and if you’d rather drive a nice, newish GM car instead of your neighbor’s Tesla the service might be for you.

The Audi R8 e-tron is dead if a report from Car and Driver is to be believed. The production version of the car was unveiled at the 2015 Geneva Auto Show and apparently Audi produced fewer than 100 vehicles — which sported a $1.1 million window sticker each.
When announced, the e-tron seemed like a key part of Audi’s future. Built in the same vein as the R8, the e-tron sat on top of Audi’s line as a shining electric halo. A 92 kWh battery-powered two electric motors provided 456 horsepower and 679 pound-feet of torque. This resulted in an acceptable but not neck-snapping zero to 60 mph time of 3.9 seconds.
The e-tron was the only R8 model available with rear-wheel drive. The rest of the model range was equipped with all-wheel drive.
The e-tron was Audi’s entrant into the automobile world’s EV supercar race. When the concept was announced in 2010, many automakers were producing one-off electric concepts of various flavors. Mercedes-Benz went upscale with the SLS AMG coupe electric drive, while BMW turned the stunning BMW Vision Efficient Dynamics into a relatively affordable hybrid supercar.
So where does this leave Audi? The German automaker currently sells the A3 e-tron, an affordable plug-in hybrid hatchback. But owned by Volkswagen, Audi likely has several major EV projects in the pipeline, though none have been detailed. And none will be as gorgeous as the e-tron.

820,How a unique approach to auto repair led to a new kind of shop software,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/12/how-a-unique-approach-to-auto-repair-led-to-a-new-kind-of-shop-software/,2016/10/12," 



At Luscious Garage in San Francisco, the publicized focus on hybrid vehicles actually masks the real differentiator: a focus on people. Founder Carolyn Coquillette started the San Francisco-based auto shop in 2007, and as you can see from the video above, everything from the decor to the space it occupies is a departure from what you might expect from a mechanic – and that extends to the software that runs the whole thing, which Coquillette showed me during a recent visit.
For Coquillette, it wasn’t enough to change the spatial arrangements and interpersonal components of an auto shop; the technology that helps track service, manage inventory and communicate with customers also needed a major overhaul. Typical shop back-end software is essentially of Stone Age vintage, especially compared to the average software customers have on their smartphones.
Coquillette saw the need for improvement as an opportunity not only for Luscious Garage, but also for other auto shops looking for a better solution for managing work, handling inventory and providing more transparency to customers in a way they could easily understand. After starting out with a custom shop management platform dubbed “Hyspace,” Coquillette began work on turning that into something more mature, which became a product in its own right and is used by others facing similar back-end modernization challenges.

With a dedicated team, including lead developer Tyler Olmstead, Hyspace became Shop-Ware, with a fresh code start in 2013 and an MVP launch in 2014; Shop-Ware made its official debut as a full-featured shop management platform in January of 2015.
The web-based interface is easy to navigate, visually appealing, dynamic for use on a variety of platforms and builds in both staff-facing inventory and workflow management, as well as client-facing communication for work approvals and work history, and QuickBooks integration for integrated bookkeeping. When Coquillette showed me what it could do in terms of communicating exactly what service your car needs and why, it was revelatory – Shop-Ware can help build a more trusting, long-lasting relationship between consumers and car service providers thanks to its easy-to-parse reporting features.
For customers, navigating car shops can seem like a daunting task, especially if you have no technical expertise. With Shop-Ware, Coquillette has made that a lot easier, while also making communication between staff members and general operations a lot easier. Like Slack, Shop-Ware is a great example of how a roll-your-own approach to building a tech tool in pursuit of your primary business can end up being something plenty of others can make use of, too.

821,Tesla and SolarCity shareholders to vote on proposed merger November 17,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/12/tesla-and-solarcity-shareholders-to-vote-on-proposed-merger-november-17/,2016/10/12,"
Despite some shareholder opposition, the Tesla acquisition of SolarCity proposed by Elon Musk continues to make progress, with a new date set for a vote of the shareholders of each company: November 17. That’s the date to mark in your calendars for a more firm go/no-go signal for the deal, which would see Musk move closer to his vision of a company that can manage clean energy from production all the way through down to consumption, with the goal of making that whole process attainable for everyday consumers.
A Tesla blog update notes the vote date, and reiterates the value the company sees in the union, as summed up in this paragraph:
[A] combined Tesla and SolarCity will be able to provide the first ever opportunity to generate, store and consume energy entirely sustainably, through a suite of integrated products that add aesthetics and function while reducing cost. By leveraging SolarCity’s installation network and Tesla’s global retail footprint, we can do this in a way that is seamless for our customers and that we expect will create significant value for our shareholders.
Between now and the vote date, Tesla and SolarCity will both have ample opportunity to make the case more strongly for a combination of the vision of the two companies; a Tesla/SolarCity joint event is planned for October 28, at which we’ll see SolarCity’s solar roof product debut for the first time, as well as the next-generation home energy storage device, the Powerwall 2.0. Tesla will also be offering financial details regarding the merge plan on November 1, the company says.
Tesla has faced opposition to the proposed acquisition of SolarCity, including in the form of a shareholder lawsuit that seeks to block the deal. Musk has been very vocal about the potential benefits of bringing the two together, however, and even recently tweeted that bringing on additional funding either via equity or debt-based raises isn’t going to be necessary for either in Q4. He also includes power generation as a key component of the second phase of his “Master Plan,” the end goal of which is to make transportation sustainable, and even revenue generating for Tesla vehicle owners.

822,BMW’s motorcycle concept is so smart you won’t need a helmet to ride it,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/12/bmws-motorcycle-concept-is-so-smart-you-wont-need-a-helmet-to-ride-it/,2016/10/12,"
Motorcycles aren’t exactly safe, but BMW envisions a future where two-wheel vehicles have enough onboard intelligence to make it possible for drivers to use them without protective clothing. The emphasis here is still on the thrill of the drive, but intelligent driver assistance features will help make it possible for the ride to maintain its thrill while adding a lot more safety.
The so-called Motorrad VISION NEXT 100 vehicle is one in a series of BMW concepts that aim to anticipate where its future vision is going, and how incorporating new technologies and connectivity features will change the driving experience.
With the Motorrad, the answer is less a path to full autonomy, as you might expect with four-wheeled cars, and instead represents a natural conclusion based on the aspects of motorcycle riding that people value. That means the end-user experience is more about the freedom of the open road, with issues like safety handled by on-board artificial intelligence systems.

The appeal of a motorbike you can ride without having to heap on layers of protective gear, including a huge cumbersome helmet, is indeed an amazing proposition. BMW says the Motorrad’s systems will anticipate the road ahead and offer drivers guidance on what to do to avoid incidents, and even step in and take over to prevent anything from happening if necessary. It also uses a self-balancing system that absolutely prevents the possibility of a tip-over, either when in motion or when standing still.
There is some headgear involved, even though the helmet is gone in the concept – it’s a lightweight visor, however, and it’s made to keep the wind out of your eyes but also to overlay important information on your view, including anticipated twists and turns. Powering everything is a zero-emission electric drive train.
Again, this is a concept so it’s far from being a real thing, but it is a very cool vision of what might be next for the motorcycle industry in a future where autonomy is king for cars.

823,Here’s how The White House wants the U.S. to approach AI R&D,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/12/white-house-reports-on-ai-no-skynet/,2016/10/12,"
Since 1956, when computer science researchers gathered in the small town of Hanover, N.H. at Dartmouth College to talk about the field’s nascent investigations into artificial intelligence, both government and industry in the U.S. have grappled with how to structure a systematic approach to research and development in the newly important field.
From the government’s perspective, this is increasingly important. With both federal research institutions and private companies pursuing artificial intelligence breakthroughs at breakneck speed, the federal government is frankly having a bit of an existential crisis about its role in research efforts and the priorities it has for what AI research should look like.
To wit, in 2015 government spending on unclassified research and development in AI-related technologies was around $1.1 billion, according to one of the twin reports released today. But in the last five years alone, mergers and acquisitions among private companies vying for dominance in the AI market have far outstripped that figure, according to data from CB Insights.
Google’s acquistion of DeepMind was reportedly $600 million, and that’s one of over one hundred acquisitions made by companies like Facebook, Google, Apple, and Twitter since 2011.
So The White House has released a new pair of reports, offering a framework for how government-backed research into artificial intelligence should be approached and what those research initiatives should look like (basically, the government wants to avoid a Skynet scenario).
The main paper, entitled “Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence,” focuses on the general state of and challenges faced by AI, and both of those things have a constant presence on our front page.
Justice for AI
Google, for instance, addressed the possibility of bias tainting the results of AI systems, which know not what they do. This is merely irritating when it’s an image recognition error, but what if it’s for “predictive policing”?

AI needs good data. If the data is incomplete or biased, AI can exacerbate problems of bias. It is important that anyone using AI in the criminal justice context is aware of the limitations of current data.
The use of AI to make consequential decisions about people, often replacing decisions made by human actors and institutions, leads to concerns about how to ensure justice, fairness, and accountability.
Transparency concerns focused not only on the data and algorithms used, but also on the potential to have some form of explanation for any AI-based determination… Ethical training should be augmented with technical tools and methods for putting good intentions into practice by doing the technical work needed to prevent unacceptable outcomes.

Google’s solution, at least for now, is what they call the “equality of opportunity” method, which ensures a system doesn’t accidentally discriminate based on sensitive, non-relevant data, for instance race or religion, when calculating something not directly related to them. As for understanding the models created by machine learning — that’s a bigger problem.
Share and share a lot
As AI and AI-like systems proliferate, they begin to overlap with highly regulated areas, as we’ve seen with autonomous vehicles and drones. This creates a sort of wild west compared with the traditional sides of those industries, and things like reporting and risk management aren’t anywhere near formalized.
How detailed should Google’s self-driving car accident reports be? Can NTSB officials inspect Autopilot code? Where do federal and state authority interface?
To make informed decisions, the White House suggests more and better data is required:

Commercial aviation has mechanisms for sharing incident and safety data across the industry. No comparable system currently exists for the automotive industry… The lack of consistently reported incident or near-miss data increases the number of miles or hours of operation necessary to establish system safety, presenting an obstacle to certain AI approaches that require extensive testing for validation.
Federal actors should focus in the near-term on developing increasingly rich sets of data, consistent with consumer privacy, that can better inform policy-making as these technologies mature.

Furthermore, as AI systems infiltrate our infrastructure, the cowboys of private AI research should look to old school civil engineers for help, as little as they might like the idea:
Adapting gracefully to unforeseen situations is difficult yet necessary for safe operation. Experience in building other types of safety-critical systems and infrastructure, such as aircraft, power plants, bridges, and vehicles, has much to teach AI practitioners about verification and validation, how to build a safety case for a technology, how to manage risk, and how to communicate with stakeholders about risk.
AI ABCs
You’ve got to get them while they’re young, according to the White House. And we agree, of course: STEM education should start early — with an emphasis on the T, in this case.
An AI-enabled world demands a data-literate citizenry that is able to read, use, interpret, and communicate about data, and participate in policy debates about matters affected by AI. Data science education as early as primary or secondary school can help to improve nationwide data literacy, while also preparing students for more advanced data science concepts and coursework after high school.
Of course, a data-literate citizenry implies a literate citizenry, and the ethics of all this stuff won’t be learned in CS class, so we can’t neglect the humanities, either.
The report also calls for pushes for diversity, highlighting comments solicited from experts regarding “the importance of AI being produced by and for diverse populations.”
Doing so helps to avoid the negative consequences of narrowly focused AI development, including the risk of biases in developing algorithms, by taking advantage of a broader spectrum of experience, backgrounds, and opinions.
From goals to guidelines
The goal with both papers is to establish what an effective approach to artificial intelligence looks like from a government perspective. There’s an understanding that corporate interests will pursue corporate interests, but a range of issues exist in the development of artificial intelligence technologies that businesses are not necessarily equipped to deal with. And they don’t have any incentives to try and grapple with some of these issues anyway.
The report on the government’s strategic investment plan states:
The Federal government is the primary source of funding for longterm, high-risk research initiatives, as well as near-term developmental work to achieve department- or agency-specific requirements or to address important societal issues that private industry does not pursue. The Federal government should therefore emphasize AI investments in areas of strong societal importance that are not aimed at consumer markets—areas such as AI for public health, urban systems and smart communities, social welfare, criminal justice, environmental sustainability, and national security, as well as long-term research that accelerates the production of AI knowledge and technologies.
Alongside this emphasis on artificial intelligence for the public good, is an acknowledgement that these innovations could lead to job insecurity as the robots take over. That’s why one of the main thrusts of the government’s research is in how to make artificial intelligence work with humans rather than exclusively work for humans, or work instead of humans.
The meat of the government’s strategy, outlined in the bullet points below, deals with the human cost of artificial intelligence.

Strategy 1: Make long-term investments in AI research. Prioritize investments in the next generation of AI that will drive discovery and insight and enable the United States to remain a world leader in AI R&D.
Strategy 2: Develop effective methods for human-AI collaboration. Rather than replace humans, most AI systems will collaborate with humans to achieve joint optimal system performance and benefit. Research is needed to create effective interactions between humans and AI systems.
Strategy 3: Understand and address the ethical, legal, and societal implications of AI. We expect AI technologies to behave according to the formal and informal norms to which we hold our fellow humans. Research is needed to understand the ethical, legal, and social implications of AI, and to develop methods for designing AI systems that align with ethical, legal, and societal goals.
Strategy 4: Ensure the safety and security of AI systems. Before AI systems are in widespread use, assurance is needed that the systems will operate safely and securely, in a controlled, well-defined, and well-understood manner. Further progress in research is needed to address this challenge of creating AI systems that are reliable, dependable, and trustworthy.
Strategy 5: Develop shared public datasets and environments for AI training and testing. The depth, quality, and accuracy of training datasets and resources significantly affect AI performance. Researchers need to develop high quality datasets and environments and enable responsible access to high-quality datasets as well as to testing and training resources.
Strategy 6: Measure and evaluate AI technologies through standards and benchmarks. Essential to advancements in AI are standards, benchmarks, testbeds, and community engagement that guide and evaluate progress in AI. Additional research is needed to develop a broad spectrum of evaluative techniques.
Strategy 7: Better understand the national AI R&D workforce needs. Advances in AI will require a strong community of AI researchers. An improved understanding of current and future R&D workforce demands in AI is needed to help ensure that sufficient AI experts are available to address the strategic R&D areas outlined in this plan.

It’s also worth mentioning that these reports aren’t the last word (or even the first word) on the U.S. approach to artificial intelligence. There are at least seven other (probably very long) research and development strategic plans that deal with aspects of the government’s approach to AI research.
That’s a good thing, too because, as the White House report acknowledges, we’re no longer necessarily the leader in the field. Research from China has outstripped the U.S. (at least in terms of papers published on the subject).

Now’s the time for a more invigorated policy, which perhaps these papers will help charge.

824,Waze and Esri make app-to-infrastructure possible,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/11/waze-and-ezri-make-app-to-infrastructure-possible/,2016/10/11,"
The interactive navigation app Waze, with its 65 million active monthly users, has partnered with Esri, which provides geographic information systems (GIS) software to 25,000 state, local and national governments. While the combination isn’t quite the vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communication that will enable autonomous vehicles in the future, it is a kind of app-to-infrastructure system that improves traffic and creates more reliable maps for drivers right now.
This isn’t anything new for Waze. It’s been running the Connected Citizens Program (CCP) since 2014, a free two-way data exchange with its municipal partners. It just announced its hundredth partner recently, Transport for London, but it works with cities around the globe, from Jakarta to Rio de Janeiro to Montreal.
“Esri is a leading GIS software provider,” said Adam Fried, new business development manager at Waze. “Any time we see an opportunity to augment our data, we do it.”
With so many municipalities already using Esri, it was easy to add Waze data to cities’ current mapping software. Fried said one of the biggest barriers Waze had encountered with municipalities was resource constraints — time, money and technology. Teaming up with Esri “meets our partners where they are,” Fried said, without having to invest in specialized software or training.
It’s also not anything new for Esri, which partnered with HERE in 2013. “Cities are using our software as a system of record,” said Andrew Stauffer, who works with civic technology at Esri. Cities already have data on things like miles of roadway, street signs, school zones and school districts.
“That’s what brought this problem to light,” Stauffer explained. “A community we were working with said, ‘You guys make some amazing maps and great analysis software, but how do we get the data out there into the public? Nobody’s going online to check a PDF or web application [for road closures, etc.]. They’re relying on apps to do navigation.’ Helping that city solve that problem is how we got introduced to Waze.”
Stauffer described its part in the partnership as “taking the firehose of information from Waze and turning it into action.” Depending on how the municipality wants to use that data, it can take the Waze reports of a vehicle at the side of the road and dispatch emergency vehicles. Or it can detect a traffic jam and tweak the traffic light timing to ease congestion.
Waze has already done just that with its Connected Citizens Program. “Boston took our data and analyzed it at major intersections for traffic flow. The city addressed signal timing and decreased congestion by 18%,” a major accomplishment in Boston. “Esri allows us to magnify that exponentially.”
The possibilities range from the massive to the very small. During recent flooding in Louisiana, Waze worked with the Louisiana Department of Transportation, the city of Baton Rouge and others to disseminate information about shelter locations, closed roads and the best ways to navigate to safety. But Waze and Esri have also worked together to allow drivers in Johns Creek, Georgia, to report potholes and the city to respond by patching them.
In case you’re worried about the government getting all up in your business via Waze, Stauffer notes that the data shared by Esri and the municipalities using its software is open data. Waze anonymizes and aggregates its data, so “we [at Esri] don’t have to figure out how to anonymize it,” Stauffer said. “They take it seriously, protecting their users,” he said of Waze.
Waze also has more than 420,000 volunteer editors making sure maps are updated and information is verified. Stauffer said that in addition to Waze’s own verification and points system, the Connected Citizens Program allows users to see whether an event like a road closure was reported by the city or by users. There’s a little logo for the municipality that will pop up on the map to signal that it’s authoritative content.
Both Waze and Esri see two-way communication as a way to ease traffic and get drivers where they need to go safely and quickly, whether that’s to work or during an emergency evacuation. “It’s shocking how much open data will fix things,” Stauffer said.

825,Toyota official highlights issues with NHTSA guidelines and California self-driving rules,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/11/toyota-official-highlights-issues-with-nhtsa-guidelines-and-california-self-driving-rules/,2016/10/11,"
At a forum on Capital Hill designed to gather input from industry stakeholders on NHTSA guidelines, Toyota Motor North America director of technology and innovation policy Hilary Cain pointed out that proposed changes to California’s self-driving test guidelines would make a voluntary process requested by the new NHTSA autonomous driving guidelines essentially mandatory. This could block current ongoing tests and prevent new ones from starting, Cain noted.
“If we don’t do what’s being asked of us voluntarily by NHTSA, we cannot test an automated system in the state of California. That is preposterous and that means testing that is happening today could be halted and that means testing that is about to be started could be delayed,” Cain said at the forum, according to Reuters.
California regulators have proposed modifications to their existing guidelines that would relax certain aspects of requirements for companies and institutions testing self-driving cars on state roads. The new rules would allow human drivers and steering wheels to be entirely absent from test vehicles, provided the cars have two-way communication and NHTSA approval to operate, which requires adherence to the 15-point checklist proposed by the federal highway safety agency in guidelines revealed last month. Previously, the guidelines required that self-driving test vehicles be tested by a third-party rather than meet the 15-point checklist.
During her comments, Cain also told the forum that because the NHTSA guidelines imply accountability and enforcement, to which automakers will be subject, they might be too vague as they currently stand. In an opinion piece penned by Barack Obama alongside the introduction of the guidelines, the president seemed to indicate that the guidelines contained flexibility by design, to ensure they wouldn’t unduly stifle the potential for innovation in the self-driving industry.
Toyota, when contacted for comment regarding Cain’s comments and the car maker’s official position on NHTSA’s proposed rules, provided the following statement to TechCrunch:
We are pleased that NHTSA is exercising leadership by issuing federal guidance on automated vehicles and trying to address the emerging patchwork of state laws regulating automated vehicle performance. We also welcome NHTSA’s plans to use existing authorities to allow automakers to bring this technology safely to market. There are other concepts in the guidance that will take further analysis and careful consideration, but we look forward to working with NHTSA to finalize a federal framework that is best for consumers and their safety.

826,Self-driving cars take to UK streets for first public road tests,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/11/self-driving-cars-take-to-uk-streets-for-first-public-road-tests/,2016/10/11,"
Self-driving car startup and Oxford spinoff Oxbotica put a modified Renault car with autonomous driving tech on UK roads for the first time, in a trial in England’s Milton Keynes at a very slow 5 miles per hour. It’s a tentative start, but it’s a start nonetheless, as the car handled cornering and breaking for pedestrians all on its own.
The test is the result of British government encouragement in autonomous tech development, according to Reuters, with the ultimate aim of fielding self-driving cars in real-world use by 2020. Part of the goal of starting slow is to help gain public trust before proceeding to more difficult tests, according to one of the program organizers, and paving the way for even this humble beginning involved getting buy-in from local lawmakers via comprehensive mapping of the entire town, and running safety planning sessions with local council members.

Internationally, the race to field self-driving vehicles has clearly begun in earnest. In the U.S., testing is being conducted by Uber on a fairly large scale in Pittsburgh, for instance, and California is licensing companies for road testing, as well as considering edits to its rules for said testing that would allow for testing in vehicles which lack steering wheels and manual driving controls entirely.
Oxbotica’s test vehicles run self-driving software developed at Oxford University called Selenium, which employees sensor data collected from visual spectrum cameras and LIDAR systems in combination with each other to map the vehicle’s surroundings. The trials are part of the LUTZ Pathfinder project, which aims to eventually feed into the UK-wide Auotdrive project which will field a fleet of 40 self-driving “pods” across Milton Keynes and Coventry.

827,Self-driving tech startup Optimus Ride raises $5.25M seed round,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/11/self-driving-tech-startup-optimus-ride-raises-5-25m-seed-round/,2016/10/11,"
With sights set on developing fully autonomous driving technology, MIT spinoff startup Optimus Ride has raised $5.25 million in seed funding, led by NextView Ventures and FirstMark Capital. With the funding, Boston-based Optimus Ride hopes to provide something unique to the self-driving technology market, powered by a team with over 30 years of collective experience in robotics, on-demand transportation, electric vehicles and more.
“We have been working on new transportation systems that are based on new self-driving vehicle technologies, and we’ve been working on this for a few months already,” Optimus Ride co-founder, President, and Chief Scientist Sertac Karaman told me in an interview. “We have people on the team who have been working on autonomous vehicles for almost a decade.”
Karaman isn’t saying much about the specifics of what Optimus Ride is working on (spoiler alert: it isn’t, as the name might suggest, a giant sentient robot related to the leader of the Autobots), but he repeatedly points to the team’s talent as an indicator of what it can accomplish.
CEO Ryan Chin is an MIT PhD who co-invented the MIT CityCar, for instance, a lightweight all-electric vehicle designed specifically for urban use. CTO Albert Huang, another MIT PhD, worked at Google[x] as lead perception engineer, as well as at ReThink Robotics. CMO Jenny Larios Berlin has worked at Zipcar, where Karaman says she helped create the strategic vision for a car-sharing network that can function at scale. MIT media lab alum Ramiro Almeida is also a co-founder, having previously helped develop the first subway line in Quito, Ecuador.

Optimus Ride’s investor list is impressive too, including Lee Hower at NextView Ventures, and Amish Jani at FirstMark. MIT Media Lab Director Joi Ito also participated in the seed round, as did Greycroft Partners, Morado Venture Partners, Haystack and Uj Ventures. Nvidia also participated in the seed round, and Karaman says the startup sees the GPU maker as very much as a strategic partner.
“We’ve come together to build self-driving vehicles, or systems that are based on level 4 autonomy, and to carry that to the next transportation system,” Karaman tells me.
Already, Optimus Ride has been doing some testing of early versions of its platform, including with a September test at Perkins School for the Blind. That, combined with the background of those involved, suggests that the startup will seek to provide technology solutions aimed more broadly at mobility in general, rather than simply as a supply-side platform partner for individual carmakers looking to outfit their vehicles with Level 4 self-driving smarts.
More details will be coming out in the next few months, Karaman says, and Optimus Ride will be innovating both with the vehicles themselves, and with their approach to the business model of transportation.
“We believe our team is unique, we have an excellent team working on these types of technologies that are very relevant to each other,” Karaman said. “It’s not just about building robots; people with different expertise are here. And even when it does come to building robots or self-driving vehicles, we’re very experienced.”
Most major carmakers appear to be anticipating a future in which car ownership is but one focus of their business, while shared car networks and on-demand autonomous transportation services will offer an alternative way to get around. We’ll have to wait and see exactly what Optimus Ride has to offer, but its focus on fleets suggests it’ll fit in with a vision of the future that makes autonomous cars a shared resource.

828,GM invests in Chinese car-sharing tech company Yi Wei Xing,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/11/gm-invests-in-chinese-car-sharing-tech-company-yi-wei-xing/,2016/10/11,"
GM has invested in China’s Yi Wei Xing, a car sharing tech platform provider that’s responsible for Feezu, a timeshare rental car service similar to Zipcar, as well as providing the backend for rental companies looking to provide their own car sharing service.
GM’s equity investment in Yi Wei Xing is a strategic one, which could help the carmaker eventually expand its own Maven car-sharing brand to China down the road. GM mentions Maven specifically in a press release revealing the news, and notes that taking a stake in Yi Wei Xing will help the U.S-based automaker gain insights into the specific car-sharing needs of the Chinese market.
In a previous interview with Maven COO Dan Grossman, the executive told me that GM was definitely looking at international markets for potential expansion targets. Automakers have typically partnered with local carmakers in China to offer their vehicles for individual sale in the country, so it would make sense for them to follow the same course in order to explore the possibility of service expansions there, too.

829,"A Flint, MI university turned vacant land into autonomous vehicle proving grounds",https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/11/a-flint-mi-university-turned-vacant-land-into-autonomous-vehicle-proving-grounds/,2016/10/11,"
Kettering University unveiled this week an automotive proving grounds in a bid to lure companies and students to the Flint, MI area. The test track is on the school’s grounds, housed on land that once contained a massive General Motors’ manufacturing facility that was torn down and left abandoned.
The Kettering University GM Mobility Research Center (or MRC) features outdoor lab space and a test track for use in developing and researching autonomous vehicles, safety standards and, soon, performance technologies. The university says the track is unique in that it features Kettering’s own, private 4G LTE wireless network for use in testing vehicle-to-vehicle technologies.
Next spring the university will start construction on additional test tracks and buildings that will include automotive bays, conference rooms and indoor lab spaces.
“The MRC will have a tremendous impact on our ability to continue educating the nation’s best and most innovative scientists and engineers,” Kettering University President Robert K. McMahan said in a released statement. “It will open up many new opportunities for our faculty to engage in applied research at the cutting edge of autonomous vehicle systems design and engineering. It will also provide a state-of-the-art facility for our more than 600 corporate partners to use when researching, developing, and testing new mobility and transportation technologies.”
According to officials, several companies have already signed up to use the facility, including Delphi.
The MRC is part of a plan to revitalize 21 acres that once held the manufacturing center of Chevrolet Motors. Around General Motors’ peak, the company employed 8,000 workers at the facilities on this tract of land called by locals as Chevy in the hole (because the area is literally on a depression around the Flint River). This was the facility that housed the United Auto Workers’ Sit-Down Strike in 1936-1937. The last building in this complex was torn down in 2004 and the area sat unused for several years.
Other parts of the land have been turned into parks and common areas featuring grassland, woodlands and wetlands.

830,New auto tech VC firm V5 starts out with a $200M fund,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/11/new-auto-tech-vc-firm-v5-starts-out-with-a-200m-fund/,2016/10/11,"
Cars are almost the new social apps when it comes to VC interest, especially given the pace of development of autonomous car tech and self-driving systems. It makes sense then that we’d see more dedicated automotive tech investment vehicles, including the just-launched V5, which is helmed by father and son team Sam Valenti III and Sam Valenti IV, sequentially-named investors who have raised $150 million in capital and $50 million via line of credit for a $200 million total initial fund.
The firm is based in Michigan, which is unusual for a VC from but makes perfect sense for a investing agency focus on cars and car-related tech. V5 has already invested in another fund, a $20 million vehicle operated by Rucks Venture Management which is banking on connected car tech specifically, and which counts self-driving startup and newsmakers Nutonomy and Nauto among its portfolio companies.
V5 isn’t going after early stage investments, but is looking to invest in B and C-stage rounds, the company told Crain’s Detroit Business.

831,HERE and Iowa team up on self-driving and smart highway infrastructure,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/11/here-and-iowa-team-up-on-self-driving-and-smart-highway-infrastructure/,2016/10/11,"
Making smarter cars means working together with the people who maintain and operate the roads, so it’s promising to see location platform operator HERE announce a partnership with the Iowa Department of Transportation to help usher along the deployment of automated vehicle tech.
The alliance will see Iowa designate a part of I-380 between Iowa City and Cedar Rapids as a development corridor for creating car-to-infrastructure communication, as well as dynamic maps for using in automated cars, real-time traffic monitoring and more. The end goal is to lay the groundwork for automated driving for use both by consumers and by freight shipping companies transporting goods along the corridor.
HERE’s team-up with Iowa could give it a big advantage in terms of gaining relevance over the next few years – companies building self-driving shipping tech will be looking to providers whose platforms integrate with local city and state infrastructure, and whose systems operate across state lines as they look to build and supplement their own solutions.

832,German report calls Tesla’s Autopilot a “hazard”,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/10/german-report-calls-teslas-autopilot-a-hazard/,2016/10/10,"
A new study from Germany’s Federal Highway Research Institute (BASt) found that the autopilot feature of the Tesla Model S constitutes a “considerable traffic hazard,” according to a report in Der Spiegel.
Unsurprisingly, Tesla CEO Elon Musk doesn’t agree and today said in a tweet that those reports were “not actually based on science,” and repeated that “Autopilot is safer than manually driven cars.”
Tesla reports that its vehicles drove more than 130 million miles with Autopilot engaged before one was involved in a fatal crash. Statistically, that beats the safety record for manually driven cars which are involved in a fatal crash every 100 million miles in the U.S., according to data from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.
We reached out to Tesla Motors for further information. Executives were not immediately available to comment.
It’s worth noting that Der Spiegel reports that the study was an internal one, and did not represent a final evaluation.
The new report was commissioned after an accident on a German highway late last month. A Tesla Model S with the Autopilot engaged crashed into a bus. Nobody was hurt in the accident, but it did spur the agency to take a closer look at Tesla’s Autopilot.
The report cites a number of issues the testers found with Tesla’s systems. Among other things, the car didn’t follow the right road markings in a construction zone — and when there were no road markings, the car simply followed the vehicle in front of it.
Another problem the Tesla faced was due to the simple fact that there are still plenty of stretches on the German Autobahn where there are no speed limits. The report says the car’s sensors only look about 40 meters behind it. If the Tesla is going the standard Autobahn speed of 80 miles per hour but somebody is going 125 miles per hour in the left lane (or even faster), that’s not nearly enough.
Tesla’s Autopilot feature is billed as driver assistive, not fully autonomous, technology, but the German report notes that the name suggests otherwise. The company recently launched an Autopilot update and is expected to unveil more product news on October 17th.

 
 
The authors of the German report actually argue that the Model S should be banned from German streets. The Transport Minister, though, is likely to ignore this according to Der Spiegel and instead plans to provide Tesla with a grant to test the Autopilot in Germany.
While Musk defended his company’s technology against the German report on Twitter today, he also praised German lawmakers new resolution to ban gasoline and diesel vehicles by 2030.

833,The Barnacle means no more boots on your wheel,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/10/the-barnacle-means-no-more-boots-on-your-wheel/,2016/10/10,"
The Barnacle is a new way for parking patrols to immobilize vehicles. Instead of using a boot to keep a wheel from moving, officers can slap a Barnacle across the windshield, suction it to the glass, and arm it with a keypad.
The Barnacle is a bright yellow 20-pound piece of plastic that sticks to the windshield with 750 pounds of force. The parking enforcement officer only has to pump the device a half dozen times to stick the two giant suction cups to the glass. The he sets the alarm and tracking system using the keypad built into the device. If you come to your Barnacled car and try to drive away anyway, a high-pitched alarm will sound.
Just like the boot, the Barnacle isn’t something you’ll find on your car when your meter runs out one day. It is something you’ll find if you have loads of unpaid parking tickets, prolonged illegal parking, or even having unpaid taxes, depending on the city’s regulations. Unlike the boot, if you leave your car there with the Barnacle on and don’t deal with the issues that got your car Barnacled in the first place, your car can easily be towed away.
This makes it easier to immobilize your car, but it also makes it easier to get back on the road. There’s a number to call, and you can pay your ticket (or all of your tickets) immediately. They’ll give you a code to unlock the Barnacle and remove it from your car.
But now you have a hunk of yellow plastic to deal with. Not to worry — Barnacle is working to partner with ride hailing services in the near future to pick up the Barnacle when you’ve unlocked it. According to an email from Barnacle, you can be free of the suction cups within 10 minutes. If there isn’t a ride hailing service in your area, you have 24 hours to bring the Barnacle, which folds up and fits in a trunk, to a drop-off site.
The ultimate in Barnacle convenience would be an app that allows you to pay with your phone and get the release code via text rather than calling an operator. But maybe, if you have parking violations often enough to wish you could download an app for repeat use, you should reconsider your parking strategies.
Edited to clarify the company’s relationship with ride hailing services.

834,Industrial robots will replace manufacturing jobs — and that’s a good thing,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/09/industrial-robots-will-replace-manufacturing-jobs-and-thats-a-good-thing/,2016/10/09,"




Matthew Rendall
Contributor


Matthew Rendall is the CEO of OTTO Motors, a division of Clearpath Robotics.
 


If you listen to the wrong people, the North American manufacturing industry is doomed.
There is no denying that the U.S. and Canada have been losing jobs to offshore competition for almost half a century. From 2000 to 2010 alone, 5.6 million jobs disappeared.
Interestingly, though, only 13 percent of those jobs were lost due to international trade. The vast remainder, 85 percent of job losses, stemmed from “productivity growth” — another way of saying machines replacing human workers.
For many, this scenario is even worse. China and Mexico may be “taking our jobs,” but at least they’re going to other humans. Robots, on the other hand, allegedly threaten to wipe entire sectors, like manufacturing, right off the map. The level of fear-mongering here is high: “How to Keep Your Job When Robots Take Over.” “Is a robot about to take your job?” “What Governments Can Do When Robots Take Our Jobs.” It’s enough to make anyone a little nervous.
The facts, however, tell a different story. Over the last 20 years, inflation-adjusted U.S. manufacturing output has increased by almost 40 percent, and annual value added by U.S. factories has reached a record $2.4 trillion. While there are fewer jobs, more is getting done. Manufacturing employees are better educated, better paid and producing more valuable products — including the technology that enables them to be so much more productive.
In fact, there are currently two million jobs going unfulfilled in the manufacturing sector, largely due to an aging workforce — the average age of a manufacturing worker is almost 45, two and a half years above the national non-farm median — and negligible interest in those jobs from younger generations.
As long as we’ve had technology, we’ve had Luddites who sometimes literally destroy technological advancements.
These numbers lead to a different conclusion: Robots aren’t stealing our jobs — they’re improving them.
Robots are safer. They are more reliable. They are more ethical than using exploited labor overseas. Plus, they’re incredibly cost-effective, often delivering return on investment (ROI) in 12 months or less. That is a game-changer in an industry relentlessly driven by cost reduction and plagued by slow-drip evolution.
The subsequent cost savings produce a ripple effect. More jobs that are more desirable can remain in North America. Manufacturers can focus on and invest in innovation. As a result, new jobs are created that require and build a better educated, highly skilled workforce. There will be short-term job displacements, but long-term benefits to workers and society as a whole.
This isn’t just some unproven utopian vision. Periods of technological displacement show a consistent pattern in history. In the last century, we moved from people manually building cars to robots assembling cars. As a result, manufacturers both produce more cars and employ more people per car than before. Instead of performing dangerous tasks, those workers now program the robots to do the dirty work for them — and get paid more for doing so. As long as we’ve had technology, we’ve had Luddites who sometimes literally destroy technological advancements — and yet, here we are, more productive, with a higher quality of living than ever.
Economics prove this out, as well. Periods of heavy investment in automation, like the industrial revolution, are strongly correlated with improvement in a nation’s GDP, which itself is strongly correlated with improvement in quality of life. This includes everything from safer workplaces with fewer injuries to greater personal satisfaction from performing more skilled work, creating a positive cycle. More skilled work means higher pay, which allows people to afford higher education, which leads to an even more skilled workforce that has the time and disposable income to further boost the economy.

A recent Washington Post article explained this well: “[This] is the natural dynamic by which market economies become richer as productivity improves. Improvements in agriculture productivity led to a wave of migration of farm workers to cities, where they provided the manpower for an industrial economy that eventually became so productive that we could afford to buy more health care, education, and yes, government.” We’re in the midst of the same cycle right now.
Which brings us back to the state of manufacturing in North America. In spite of the fear-mongering and media hype, legitimate individual concerns and hollow political rants, robots are revolutionizing the industry for the better. They are simply the latest form of technology criticized for taking jobs that no one should have to do.
In reality, they will enable us to keep more (and better) jobs at home, to grow local industry, to improve our lives at the micro and macro levels. With greater automation, efficiency, safety and productivity, the North American manufacturing sector will not only survive, it will showcase the power of our innovation and ingenuity.
So, will a robot take your job? Maybe. But in return, you — and your children and grandchildren — will likely find more meaningful work, for better pay. Sounds like a good trade-off to me.

Tesla will unveil something on Monday October 17, according CEO and founder Elon Musk. It’ll be a new product, he said in a Tweet on Sunday, which will be “unexpected by most,” and which will be separate from a Tesla/SolarCity product unveiling on the 28th.


Tesla product unveiling on the 17th (unexpected by most), followed by Tesla/SolarCity on the 28th
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 9, 2016



Musk previously teased the October 28 event, saying it would include the unveiling of joint products from both the electric car and the solar energy companies, including a solar roof, along with an integrated second generation of the Tesla Powerwall energy storage solution, and a Tesla EV charger.
The new information from Musk suggests Tesla will be revealing something new on top of all of the above. Some possibilities include a new vehicle (many have been looking for a Roadster 2.0 launch), or improvements to its autonomous driving features. The company recently launched its Autopilot 8.0 update, but Musk had suggested earlier in the year that the company is making progress on self-driving tech at a pace that might surprise most.
Following his tweet about the upcoming events, Musk also said that neither Tesla nor SolarCity will need to raise either additional equity or corporate debut in the fourth quarter, as some observers had suggested it might. It’s another sign that these events are likely designed at least in part to reassure investors that Musk’s proposed merger of the two companies is actually in the best interests of both.

836,Wheego and Valeo get California road driverless testing permits,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/07/wheego-and-valeo-get-california-road-driverless-testing-permits/,2016/10/07,"
Self-driving car testing in California is becoming a badge of progress for companies working in the space. Only 17 companies in total have the honor, including two just added to the list: Wheego Electric Cars and Valeo North America.
The Wall Street Journal reports that both of these new companies now have approval to run tests with a single vehicle each and four drivers per team. That might not sound like much, but it’s a foot in the door, and membership in the club is itself somewhat testament to how much the companies have already accomplished, since the other members include major carmakers like Tesla, Cruise (which got its license before being acquired by GM), promising startup Drive.ai, and Baidu, to name a few.
The new members are interesting additions: Wheego is an electric carmaker which got its start taking Chinese-built cars, outfitting them with battery’s and electric motors in the U.S. and putting them on the road. The company now says it builds electric vehicles designed “for a global market,” and focuses on the benefits of connected tech in making vehicles aware of their surroundings.
Valeo North America is a subsidiary of Valeo SA, a multinational car part supplier base in France which creates everything from powertrains, to lighting and wipers, to driving assistance and connected car components. Valeo’s autonomous test car, dubbed the Cruise4U, managed a full 24 hours on the Paris Beltway in one driving session in late September, with 99 percent of that time spent under fully autonomous drive mode, excepting the breaks it took to swap out human test drivers.

The electric vehicle bandwagon has long left the station thanks to Tesla, but Maserati still wants to get on board. The high-end carmaker might be behind the curve when it comes to announcing its electric vehicle plans, but it’s looking like the Fiat-Chrysler-owned company will manage to ship a fully electric car by 2020, with something to show off in the 2019 timeframe.
The Maserati EV won’t be a Tesla Model S competitor, but will instead be more in the “grand-touring coupe” vein according to Car and Driver, which spoke to Maserati engineering lead Roberto Fedeli about the company’s EV plans at the Paris Motor show this past week.
Fedeli told the publication it’s well aware they’re late to the game, and will probably be “last” to market with a production electric car in the premium segment. But he also said this means they’ll have to deliver something “very different” from the offerings of competitors. He acknowledged that the carmaker has to think about what its brand means in the EV space, since signature Maserati trademarks like the sound of the engine and the lightness of the cars run at cross-purposes to EVs with whisper quiet motors and battery-laden heavy chassis.
It’s an interesting look at how established carmakers have to re-think their brands in light of the increased popularity and demand for electric cars, and how that might result in very different-looking offerings in terms of both tech and design, relative both to existing lineups and to the competition.

838,Rinspeed’s Oasis self-driving car concept is living space on wheels,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/07/rinspeeds-oasis-self-driving-car-concept-is-living-space-on-wheels/,2016/10/07,"Self-driving cars of the future won’t need to be configured on the inside the way they are now, since things like steering columns won’t be required. Electric drive trains will also help maximize available interior space, so it makes sense that cars will look dramatically different inside and out when the two things combine, as they seem inevitably on track to do.
The new Rinspeed Oasis concept car is an urban self-driving vehicle, equipped with two seats that can swivel independently to accommodate different seating accommodations. The interior is also designed as “living space,” the comp pay notes, with “the ambience of a modern-day family room.” That includes amenities like an armchair, a TV, and a windshield that can offer immersion in fully virtualized surroundings (you don’t necessarily need to see outside if you’re not driving, after all), or augmented reality displays with overlays on the passing view.
The car is designed as a shared resource, meaning it can be reconfigured easily for different purposes, including relaxing as mentioned above, but also as a delivery vehicle thanks to an included, climate-controlled and passcode protected delivery drawer.
How realistic is the concept? Well, it’s real enough to be shown off at the upcoming CES in January 2017, so that’s something. Rinspeed has also anticipated other key innovations in car technology, including steering-wheel integrated controls, which it introduced in 1985, and it’s been workmen with cars and carmakers since 1977.
Given the pace of development of autonomous driving tech, it might not be long before interior design of vehicles for specific uses and car types is big business. In a world where driving isn’t the primary activity that happens inside a car’s cockpit, the options for what they look like on the inside are going to broaden considerably.

839,"BMW, Toyota and Allianz back NAUTO and its camera-based approach to making autonomous vehicles",https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/07/bmw-toyota-and-allianz-back-nauto-and-its-camera-based-approach-to-making-autonomous-vehicles/,2016/10/07,"
A self-driving car tech startup called NAUTO has raised an undisclosed amount of venture funding, and entered into data-sharing partnerships with big-name auto and insurance companies BMW, Toyota and Allianz Group.
Specifically, BMW iVentures, Toyota Research Institute and Allianz Ventures have invested in NAUTO’s Series A round. The startup and its investors declined to disclose the amount of funding newly invested in the extension. NAUTO previously raised $12 million in Series A funding.
Founded in 2015 by CEO Stefan Heck and CTO Frederick Soo, NAUTO uses cameras, motion sensors and GPS systems, as well as its own artificial intelligence software, to detect what’s happening on the road, as well as inside a car.
When there’s a risky situation on the road, or too much distraction within a vehicle, NAUTO alerts drivers to help them refocus and avoid accidents.
The company’s systems, which include a cabin-facing and a forward-facing camera, record automatically when they sense that a collision is about to happen.
In cases where there is a collision, archived video allows professional drivers to show their employers, insurance providers and the police what really happened to settle questions or refute assumptions about who caused an accident.
Drivers can also use NAUTO to “initiate” an incident, or begin recording if they have an unruly passenger inside the car, for example. Doing so alerts a driver’s fleet manager that there is a problem, and sends them a live stream of what’s happening in and around the car.
NAUTO’s CEO Stefan Heck said his company’s technology is useful today for professional drivers and will only improve over time, with miles driven and driver behavior observed and analyzed.
NAUTO’s dashcam-like system detects dangerous situations on the road, or within a car, to help drivers avoid collisions.
“People are familiar with follow the lanes, don’t hit the car in front of you and you will mostly stay out of trouble… But that doesn’t work in downtown San Francisco, or New York, with lots of people, traffic and parked cars,” Heck said. “We’re building and using a data set to help OEMs and other partners develop the next generation of autonomous capability for vehicles in urban areas.”
NAUTO’s technology is used by dozens of fleets that deliver packages, food, oil and gas, or transport passengers around for taxi, limo and other transportation services, the CEO said.
Uber and Lyft drivers sign up to get NAUTO through drivers’ associations, but NAUTO has not yet struck a corporate deal with a transportation network company.
Toyota Research Institute’s Jim Adler said one reason the company invested in and is working with NAUTO is that it’s technology could help accelerate the arrival of autonomous cars that are safe for mainstream use.
“There’s an assumption in the industry that we will need self-driving cars to cover billions of miles across all kinds of weather, traffic and other conditions before they are safe. We think it will take trillions of miles to understand everything we need to. And NAUTO is already out there, researching traffic and driver behavior in dangerous situations,” Adler said.

Uber’s self-driving cars are operating on Pittsburgh streets, so it’s only natural they’d pick up some professional athletes along the way. Defensive ends Cam Heyward and Stephon Tuitt likely max out the passenger capacity of the back of that Uber-tech equipped Ford Fusion that picks them up, but they do manage to get in and take the trip.
My favorite moment here might be when Tuitt basically says what every person contemplating a first ride in one of these is thinking before they actually get picked up by the car.


Tuitt: ""What are we going to do?"" Cam: ""Don't worry, bro. I got the @Uber_PIT."" pic.twitter.com/08KhpV02GR
— Pittsburgh Steelers (@steelers) October 7, 2016



The video has some solid explanatory sections that cover its LiDAR capabilities, laying the basics of that tech pretty clearly. It also might be the closest non-Pittsburgh residents get to being able to take a ride inside one for a while.
Uber’s doing its self-driving trials in Pittsburgh because that’s where its robotics facility is located. The ride-hailing company took most of its self-driving vehicle engineering department from nearby Carnegie Mellon University, so it makes sense that it would choose the city to host its Advanced Technologies Center, and to kick off its initial driverless trials.
Testing defensive end load-bearing capabilities might not be absolutely crucial to achieving a wider rollout, but it will help Uber humanize the tech, which is bound to make others like Tuitt “nervous” at first.

China’s Uber-like ride hailing powerhouse Didi Chuxing is looking to build its own self-driving car project, according to an interview with CEO Cheng Wei with Bloomberg, and it’s looking for data scientists with experience in the field from Silicon Valley to hep get the job done. The company has also had talks with driverless startup UiSee Technology’s Beijing-based founder Gansha Wu, the article notes.
Didi’s autonomous ambitions definitely aren’t surprising, given the similarity of its trajectory to date with one-time rival Uber. Earlier this year, Didi and Uber announced a deal that would essentially see Uber cede its pursuit of China-based business to Didi, in exchange for a 17.7 percent ownership stake in the Chinese country and $1 billion in a one-time cash injection. Cheng still had plenty of praise for Uber and its approach to China, but the deal effectively gives Didi largely unopposed operating powers within the growing market.
Pursuit of self-driving tech could eventually put Didi back on a collision course with Uber, as the two will eventually likely seek to turn networks of self-driving cars into platform with global reach, but for now, it should be interesting to see how both approach development of the tech individually, and how Didi’s interest affects the admittedly limited available talent pool when it comes to autonomous driving specialists.

842,"Formula E grows, gains cred",https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/06/formula-e-grows-gains-cred/,2016/10/06,"
This morning, Faraday Future Dragon Racing unveiled its livery for the third season of the Formula E all-electric open-wheel racing series in Hong Kong. The car’s black-and-white fade pattern echoes the Faraday Future logo, though the company says the design takes its cues from an electromagnetic wave. In the video below, Pontus Fontaeus, chief designer of interiors at Faraday, says, “We are elegant, sophisticated, and we don’t scream to get our message through.”
Faraday’s sponsorship of the Dragon Racing team is more than a fashion statement. The company is also a technical partner to develop software to wring every electron out of the powertrain. In future years, as the EV startup and the race series itself mature, Faraday will provide hardware and powertrain components, possibly including its Echelon Inverter.
Faraday hopes to use what it learns on the track in the development of its street cars, a not-unheard-of strategy. The co-founder of LeEco’s SEE Plan for electric vehicles, Ding Lei, says the company is fully on board with the racing partnership for just that reason. LeEco is the Chinese tech giant formerly known as LeTV that has a partnership with Faraday Future to build electric cars in the US.

Now that Formula E is in its third season, with plans for several to follow, more traditional manufacturers are climbing on board. In addition to Jaguar‘s return to racing with a team for this season, Mercedes-Benz announced Tuesday that it will field a team in the 2018-2019 season.
For now, the number of teams each season is limited to 10. By the fifth season, when Mercedes will join, the ceiling will be lifted to 12 teams. That’s also the target year for teams to move from using two cars per driver to one. Until then, drivers will still have to pull into the pits and hop from one car with depleted batteries to an identical car with fresh batteries to finish the race.
Like other teams in the series, Mercedes sees Formula E as a place to stress test electrification systems. Toto Wolff, the head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport, said in a statement, “We have been watching the growth of Formula E with great interest. At the current time, we are looking at all the options available in the future of motor racing, and we are very pleased with an agreement that secures us an opportunity to enter the series in season five.”
When major automotive manufacturers and racing powerhouses—companies that move more cautiously than EV startups and technology upstarts—decide to field all-electric teams, it could be time to stop thinking of Formula E as a race-world sideshow. Especially when it’s going to provide its own autonomous vehicle sideshow, Roborace, as early as next season.

843,Udacity open sources an additional 183GB of driving data,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/05/udacity-open-sources-an-additional-183gb-of-driving-data/,2016/10/05,"
On stage at TechCrunch Disrupt last month, Udacity founder Sebastian Thrun announced that the online education company would be building its own autonomous car as part of its self-driving car nanodegree program. To get there, Udacity has created a series of challenges to leverage the power of community to build the safest car possible — meaning anyone and everyone is welcome to become a part of the open-sourced project. Challenge one was all about building a 3D model for a camera mount, but challenge two has brought deep learning into the mix.
In the latest challenge, participants have been tasked with using driving data to predict steering angles. Initially, Udacity released 40GB of data to help at-home tinkerers build competitive models without access to the type of driving data that Tesla of Google would have. However, because deep learning models drink data by the pond rather than the gallon, the company pushed out an additional 183GB of driving data.
The complete 223GB package contains data and both sunny and overcast footage from over 70 minutes of driving spread over two days in Mountain View. The variety of footage will bolster the quality of submissions and give participants more realistic data to work off of that better represents the challenges of real world driving and changing road conditions.
The videos have also been pared up with matching data like latitude, longitude, gear, brake, throttle, steering angles and speed. All of this information will fuel the creation of convolutional neural nets, ultimately enabling cameras paired with deep learning to get you safely from point a to point b.
“By letting the car figure out how to interpret images on its own, we can skip a lot of the complexity that exists in manually selecting features to detect, and drastically reduce the cost required to get an autonomous vehicle on the road by avoiding LiDAR-based solutions,” the company said in its Challenge #2 blog post.
While 223GB sounds like a lot of data, it still pales in comparison to the massive libraries that companies like Uber and Tesla are accumulating with their self-driving cars. Some reports show that complex capture systems can generate nearly a gigabyte of data every second and the aforementioned companies have millions of miles of data. By nature, these Udacity data sets will be considerably more compact in size because they only contain rudimentary data and video footage, but the context underscores just how important data will be in fueling the creation of next generation automobiles.
Of course this challenge in particular is not just about building a car, but learning along the way. If the challenge sounds interesting, head on over to GitHub where you can access Udacity’s data set.

Say you’d like to make a few extra bucks by driving for ride hailing services Lyft and Uber or on-demand delivery services like Postmates, but your old car won’t pass muster with these companies. Or maybe you don’t want to put the miles on your personal car. Or maybe you don’t even have a car of your own.
That’s where Evercar comes in. It maintains a fleet of shared vehicles in Los Angeles and, as of September, San Francisco and Oakland. All the vehicles are preapproved by major on-demand and ride hailing companies, while drivers need only submit an application and a $25 nonrefundable fee. Once you’re clear, Evercar will give you the documentation you need to sign up as a driver with a service, as well as access to the fleet and instructions on how to use the cars. Then you can use an Evercar for whatever service you like for $5 to $8 per hour, depending on your location, which covers fuel, maintenance, and insurance with no mileage limits.
You can’t take an Evercar home, unless you reserve it for that time and pay the $8 an hour to have it sit in your driveway, which defeats the service’s purpose. But you can pick up and drop off an Evercar from its home garage any time of day, so night owls can definitely apply.
The service is headquartered in Los Angeles, where it began, and where it has 1200 members sharing a fleet of more than 100 vehicles, which they’ve driven more than a million total miles. The fleet is mostly Toyota Priuses, with a smattering of Nissan Leafs available in LA.
The number of cars in the LA fleet as of May 2016 was only 43, which shows how quickly the company is growing. According to a press release, Evercar already has financing in place to buy up to 3,000 more vehicles in the next year, some of which will be EVs for the Bay Area, plus further bulking up of the Los Angeles fleet and expansion of its services.

845,Google crosses the 2 million mile mark with its self-driving cars,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/05/google-crosses-the-2-million-mile-mark-with-its-self-driving-cars/,2016/10/05,"
Google’s celebrating another milestone in its self-driving car project — a 2 million milestone, in fact. The search giant’s autonomous test cars have now racked up that many miles in public road testing, which it notes adds up to about 300 years of human driving based on the average person’s yearly total.
What’s interesting about the volume of miles Google has accumulated is that Google’s self-driving software lead Dmitri Dolgov says it’s actually “relatively easy to master the first 90% of driving,” in a Medium post announcing the news. That includes freeway driving, light traffic in cities or navigating basic intersections. But the remaining 10 percent is the tricky bit — including more complex city driving scenarios, and all the myriad edge cases that present themselves in real-world situations.
That’s been the focus of Google’s last few years of testing, and Dolgov says the company is definitely pleased with their progress, despite the steeper challenge. That includes insights gained into the social aspects of driving, the combined series of subtle cues we use both with our bodies and with our cars to signal our intentions when dealing with roadways both as pedestrians and behind the wheel.
Google doesn’t say exactly how much progress it has made in mastering that last 10 percent of driving, but it points to other progress points like the ongoing development of a fourth generation of vehicle as signs that it’s definitely getting closer to a place where we’re regularly using self-driving vehicles in the real world.

846,Volvo cars will start talking to each other by the end of 2016,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/05/volvo-cars-will-start-talking-to-each-other-by-the-end-of-2016/,2016/10/05,"
Cars being able to see the car in front of them is great, but it’s ultimately a one-way street; car-to-car two-way communication is a key ingredient toward effective and safe driver assistance and autonomy features, which is why it’s great that Volvo is set to debut its own car-to-car communications in shipping vehicles by the end of this year (via Automotive News).
Volvo isn’t the first: Mercedes-Benz and Toyota also let select models of their cars talk to one another. But this is an area of technology where critical mass will be required to effect sizeable benefits for everyday drivers, so any progress in terms of new automakers rolling out similar features is noteworthy.
Volvo’s tech will be present in the 90 series by year-end, including the S90, V90 and XC90, with wireless communication tech built in partnership with Ericsson that can send and receive warnings about road conditions between vehicles, as well as about problems with the cars themselves — activating when you turn on your hazard lights, for instance, to give cars coming up behind a heads-up that there could be trouble ahead. Communication is routed via the cloud so vehicles don’t need to have line-of-sight or other direct wireless connections.
That does mean it requires an active internet connection to work, but Volvo says it’ll also get better over time as a result of data analysis through use. Like other features, it’ll probably also trickle down to lower-cost model options after debuting on high-end vehicles.

847,What the new NHTSA guidelines mean for self-driving cars,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/04/what-the-new-nhtsa-guidelines-mean-for-self-driving-cars/,2016/10/04,"
In September, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued guidelines for the testing and deployment of autonomous [PDF] vehicles. The important thing to remember for now is that these are merely guidelines and not rules. Complying with them is voluntary on the part of automotive and hardware manufacturers, as well as app developers.
“Firms can make the decision to not comply and be within their rights to do so,” said David Strickland, general counsel for the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, who was also an NHTSA administrator between 2010 and 2014. “This is evidence of the agency’s willingness to find tools that move more quickly than traditional rule-making, which can take four to eight years.”
The document had a lot of ground to cover.
“Not everybody is a well-capitalized automotive manufacturer with risk assessment built in, and not every company is a sophisticated ride-sharing company or mass innovator and disruptor,” Strickland said. “You have to build a regulatory structure that applies to four engineers in a garage. NHTSA guidance has to take into account all of that.”
Autonomous development guidelines
Katie Thompson, who served as general counsel for the agency from 2013 to May of this year, told me that the guidelines signal how the Department of Transportation wants to work with developing tech.
“There’s an admonition to people developing tech to be mindful of people who will use it — designed to take that into account. If it’s unsafe, [NHTSA] will determine it’s a failure and ask you to recall it.”
Or as President Barack Obama said in an op-ed, “Make no mistake: If a self-driving car isn’t safe, we have the authority to pull it off the road.”
Any company developing autonomous vehicles is being asked to sign a 15-point safety checklist to pre-certify their vehicles, similar to the FAA’s system for airplanes. The NHTSA list (page 15 of the guidelines, for those following along at home) includes everything from privacy and system safety to post-crash behavior and object and event detection and response. Even ethical considerations are on the list. Each item can be marked as meeting the guidance, not meeting it, or not applicable.
The agency acknowledges that pre-certification does not prevent humans from doing dumb things (and likely uploading it to YouTube), which Thomson alluded to in our interview. The guidelines do recommend that manufacturers provide consumer education and training on how to use the new technologies “properly, efficiently, and in the safest manner possible.”
Data collection and security
NHTSA also asks that black-box-type data be “stored, maintained, and readily available for retrieval by the entity itself and by NHTSA” for the purpose of reconstructing crashes. The agency wants this data to be available regardless of whether there was a crash or an event was successfully avoided.
This data, and all other data collected by the vehicles, needs to be anonymized, according to NHTSA. “Generally, data shared with third parties should be de-identified (i.e. stripped of elements that make the data directly or reasonably linkable to a specific HAV [highly autonomous vehicle] owner or user).”
The treatment of data is the most significant piece of the guidelines, in Thomson’s opinion. “NHTSA is dead-on accurate,” she said. “This is borrowed from the FAA and their safety management systems. All the information is de-identified, but it enables the agency to proactively identify trends and risks in the system before something happens.”
But Thomson was doubtful that private automotive companies will fully comply while these guidelines are voluntary. She wondered if proprietary and security issues would trump the government’s request for data.
Strickland said NHTSA is working on another document to address data privacy and cyber security beyond what’s set out in these guidelines. “Self-driving vehicles collect personally identifiable information, geographic information, and now biometric information, and that must be protected,” he said.
NHTSA does request that cybersecurity data be shared with the agency and with other manufacturers. “Each industry member should not have to experience the same cyber vulnerabilities in order to learn from them,” the agency wrote.
Strickland agrees. “The manufacturers are as protective as they can be, but how well do you foreclose an attack? Or rectify when it’s discovered?”
Regulatory issues
NHTSA wants very badly to avoid the “patchwork of inconsistent laws and regulations” that the states have already started stitching together. Instead, “DOT strongly encourages states to allow DOT alone to regulate” autonomous vehicles and their technologies. Consumer Watchdog, among others, issued a statement noting its concerns that California’s strong regulations in this arena could be pre-empted.
Avoiding a patchwork without undoing states’ regulatory innovations was Strickland’s biggest concern as well, but he’s pleased with how the guidelines dealt with the issue. “I’m happy that they listened to advisers,” he said.
“The challenge for NHTSA is, will they be able to process all of this?” Thomson said. The pre-certification process alone is a new load of paperwork for the agency to keep up with, and the technology is moving fast.
But the process of creating the guidelines and creating a fluid framework for autonomous vehicle safety is worth the trouble, Strickland says. “The promise of the technology is transformational,” he said. “I can’t think of an innovation that’s bigger than this. If we can reduce the number of people that lost their lives in 2015 [more than 35,000], it’s beyond the value of the investment.”

848,Play this killer self-driving car ethics game,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/04/did-you-save-the-cat-or-the-kid/,2016/10/04,"
Should a self-driving car full of old folks crash to avoid puppies in the cross-walk? Is it OK to run over two criminals if you save one doctor? Whose lives are worth more, seven-year-olds or senior citizens?
In, This new game called the “Moral Machine” from MIT’s researchers, a car’s breaks fail and you have to choose whether it crashes into a barrier, killing the passengers, or swerves into the cross-walk, killing pedestrians. The game lets you make the calls in the famous “trolley problem” and see analytics about your ethics.
Thinking about these tough questions is more important than ever since engineers are coding this type of decision making into autonomous vehicles right now. Who should be responsible for these choices? The non-driving passenger, the company who made the AI or no one?

The Moral Machine poses basic choices like whether AI should intervene at all if it will save more lives, or if it should stay passive instead of actively changing events in a way that makes it responsible for someone’s death.
But the scenarios also raise more nuanced quandaries. Should pedestrians be saved instead of passengers who knowingly got into an inherently dangerous speeding metal box? Should we rely on the air bags and other safety features in a crash instead of swerving into unprotected pedestrians?
If you think these decisions are tough with clear-cut situations, imagine how tough it will be for self-driving cars amidst chaotic road conditions.

849,Fisker is back with a new electric car to debut later in 2017,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/04/fisker-is-back-with-a-new-electric-car-to-debut-later-in-2017/,2016/10/04,"
Henrik Fisker, designer of the Aston Martin V8 Vantage and Aston Martin DB9, is back with an electric car company called Fisker, Inc. – not to be confused with the old Fisker, which was acquired by Chinese auto parts giant Wanxiang and retooled as Karma Automotive. The new Fisker will also be making EVs, though, with an all-electric “spiritual successor” to the Fisker Karma to be unveiled sometime in the second half of 2017, Bloomberg reports.
The new Fisker has been quietly working on battery tech, searching for something that would lead to a “new paradigm,” Fisker told Bloomberg. So alongside the car company, Fisker, Inc. has a new battery division called Fisker Nanotech, too. The work coming out of Fisker Nanotech, and what it does differently from other EV battery makers, is not yet clear – Bloomberg notes that these won’t be conventional lithium-ion batteries, however, like the ones that power the Tesla Model S and Chevy Bolt, though they will still contain some lithium. The company does think they’ll deliver better range and overall charge life, however.
Claims for the unreleased new Fisker vehicle include a 400-mile plus driving range, which would easily be industry leading. It’s also said to have more interior space. Fisker’s plan after the launch of this first, premium vehicle is to follow it up with a mass-market car costing less than $40,000, but again with range that beats anyone else in that price group. The new company also hopes to become a key supplier of battery tech to other OEMs, which, if successful, could help it fund its own car projects.
Henrik Fisker worked on the original design of the Tesla Model S, before Tesla accused Fisker and partner Bernhard Koehler of stealing trade secrets while working for Tesla later used in the formation of the original Fisker Automotive.

850,Faraday Future partners with Chevy Bolt-supplier LG Chem on batteries,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/03/faraday-future-partners-with-chevy-bolt-supplier-lg-chem-on-batteries/,2016/10/03,"
How do you prove you’re serious about making electric cars? A partnership with one of the suppliers currently producing batteries at scale for shipping vehicles is a good start. Faraday Future announced such a union today, with a new agreement with LG Chem, the lithium-ion cell manufacturer that provides the powerhouses for vehicles including the Chevrolet Bolt EV.
The partnership accounted today will see LG Chem supply batteries for Faraday’s upcoming variable platform architecture (VPA), which is the company’s modular base platform technology that’s designed to be flexible enough to provide the powertrain basis for a range of different types of vehicles. The VPA is designed with cost efficiencies in mind, giving Faraday Future a basic platform to work with that can be extended using adjustable length rails, and equipped with different motor configurations on each axle in order to suit the needs of everything from high performance sports cars to sensible family SUVs.
LG Chem’s battery supply will also be integrated into the VPA platform, presumably allowing for modular battery configuration alongside with other components like wheelbase length.
California-based Faraday Future has revealed very little about its production vehicle plans thus far. It debuted an ambitious race-inspired sports concept, the FFZERO1, at CES in January 2015, and is funded in part by China’s LeEco, which is pursuing a number of routes toward becoming an electric carmaker in its own right. The company is also looking into producing a self-driving car, and a potential Model X competitor spotted in testing which could end up being its first production vehicle.

851,Chevrolet’s Colorado ZH2 fuel cell Army test truck is made for modular power,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/03/chrevolets-colorado-zh2-fuel-cell-army-test-truck-is-made-for-modular-power/,2016/10/03,"
Chevrolet continues work on zero-emission hydrogen fuel cell tech, and it’s now providing a just-revealed Colorado ZH2 fuel cell vehicle to the U.S. Army for design, to find out if the unique advantages of fuel cell tech are viable in actual real-world military mission situations.
The ZH2 is a modified version of the Colorado midsize pickup Chevrolet produces for the consumer market, with a specially reinforced frame designed for all-terrain use. The car’s engine compartment has also been modified to accommodate its hydrogen fuel-cell based power train, which GM says offers unique advantages for military use.
The U.S. Army’s testing will be focused on evaluating the benefits of fuel-cell tech in a number of areas, including “near-silent operation,” “reduced acoustic and thermal signatures,” “high wheel torque at all speeds,” “low fuel consumption across operating range,” and “water by-product for field uses.”
In everyday terms, that basically means that the Army will be checking out how the use of fuel cells might make for quieter, cooler rides that are harder to detect via instrument and human observation, and that can climb and tow with greater ease thanks to the continuous use of high torque which is a key ingredient of its hydrogen-powered electric drive train.

The hydrogen cells used to power the test vehicle can also potentially be used to provide a power source for field equipment, and for encampments, which is definitely useful when in missions deep in territory otherwise devoid of human settlement. Plus, the byproduct produced by the fuel cells is water – a valuable commodity on extended, remote trips.
“One of the things we started testing about 10 years ago is this exportable power take-off,” explained GM Executive Director of Global Fuel Cell Activities Charlie Freese in an interview. “Whether you’re using the vehicle in a site where you have no access to plug-in power, or if you’re a camper, or if you’re in this military environment, the ability to export 25 kW continuous, or up to 50 kW at its peak, is a really great functionality that comes out of this fuel cell system.”
One of the longer-term benefits of the use of fuel cells in this context might be the flexibility of the power source, however – the very same fuel cell power system is being used in a trial with the U.S. Navy to power an unmanned submarine. Long-term, you could see the benefits of using a common power source to fuel any number of military vehicles across branches; swapping out units in the field would not only mean better economies of scale, but shared training across operational and support personnel, too.
“You can imagine when you’re supporting them in the field, and you have a deep cache of spare parts,” Freese explained. “I could be wrong, but I’m not so sure I could imagine taking the spare parts out of a Navy depot and immediately servicing an Army vehicle, but with this [fuel cell tech] you could actually do that.”
GM developed the Colorado ZH2 in partnership with the U.S. Army Tank automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center and the entire sprint from winning the contract to producing the concept unveiled today took less than a year.  Internal GM preparation of the vehicle will continue earl into next year, at which time it’ll be handed over to the Army for a full year of field trial.

852,Tesla deliveries grow 70 percent sequentially to 24.5K cars in Q3,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/03/tesla-deliveries-grow-70-percent-sequentially-to-24-5k-cars-in-q3/,2016/10/03,"
Tesla is making progress in increasing the pace of its vehicle deliveries, as well as its vehicle production, according to a press release issued by the company on Sunday. The electric car maker delivered around 24,500 cars in its fiscal Q3 this year, including 15,800 Model S and 8,700 Model X. That’s a 70 percent jump from Q2’s 14,402 total deliveries, and Tesla says they’re estimating on the low side, since a delivery only counts if the customer actually has the car in hand, and all the paperwork has gone through.
For example, Tesla says there were 5,500 vehicles “in transit to customers,” but none of these were counted in the Q3 total, and will instead be reflected in the Q4 quarter, which Tesla anticipates will be “at or slightly above” Q3 for deliveries. Likewise for production, which hit 25,185 vehicles in Q3, up from 18,345 in Q2.
Tesla’s progress in delivering and making cars will mean it can achieve its existing guidance of delivering 50,000 cars during the second half of 2016, which is essentially how many it delivered during all of 2015 (50,580). The ramp up in production is impressive, but it also shows just how far Tesla still has to go in order to match CEO Elon Musk’s ambitious targets of producing 500,000 electric vehicles annually by 2018, and 1 million per year by 2020.
Sill, the company is making progress – its order volume for Q3 2016 represents an over 100 percent increase in deliveries vs. the same quarter in 2015, for instance. If it can keep up that pace of growth with existing facilities until they reach saturation, and add on new manufacturing capacity at the same time, 500k cars per year in a couple of years’ time starts to look achievable.

853,Volvo to target luxury buyers with self-driving car coming in 5 years,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/29/volvo-to-target-luxury-buyers-with-self-driving-car-coming-in-5-years/,2016/09/29,"
High-end vehicle, chauffeur included? You can see why it makes sense that Volvo would target the luxury end of the market with its upcoming self-driving car. Volvo announced plans to field a vehicle by 2021, thanks in part to a $300 million deal with Uber that will let it leverage some of their work, but now we have some more details, including the vehicle’s high-end approach.
Volvo CEO Hakan Samuelsson told reporters at today’s Global Mobility Leadership Forum in Detroit that the autopilot function will be an upmarket option that comes with a price tag of somewhere in the neighborhood of $10,000, Bloomberg reports. The car it ships with will include a steering wheel — but only in case the owner opts to debase themselves by actually driving it in the style of the plebeians of the prior age.
But steering wheel or no, Samuelsson says this will be a fully autonomous car, meaning those inside the vehicle can go ahead and kick back and “watch a movie or whatever,” per Bloomberg.
Volvo’s approach is basically par for the course in terms of how new features make their way to consumer cars; start at the rarefied top, and then gradually flow down through the line first as options, then as included features at various trim levels, and finally becoming basically a universal standard.
Where it doesn’t make par is when compared to the approach to autonomous cars seemingly favored by other car makers — Ford is looking to introduce self-driving first in fleets of taxi-style vehicles, and it sounds like GM is planning to do the same. Volvo looking at offering this feature first on vehicles sold to individual drivers for personal ownership is then out-of-step with some of its biggest rivals. Hopefully that means we’ll see both types of approaches to autonomous vehicles hit the road at roughly the same time.

854,Tales from a Tesla Model S at 200k miles,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/29/tales-from-a-tesla-model-s-at-200k-miles/,2016/09/29,"
Tesloop’s first vehicle, a Tesla Model S they put into service in July 2015, has reached a new milestone: 200,000 miles on the odometer. Tesloop, you’ll recall, ferries passengers between Los Angeles and Las Vegas in electric Tesla vehicles, making it easy to rack up that many miles in a year. Not many electric cars of any make or model have reached this kind of mileage, so I was curious to find out how the Tesla is holding up.
I called Rahul Sonnad at Tesloop, who noted that these were nearly all highway miles, and the Model S was in Auto Pilot mode most of that time. According to Tesla, city vs. highway miles aren’t such a big deal in electric cars, but it’s worth mentioning.
“We did have a few things go wrong,” Sonnad said. At about 30,000 miles, the car was relaying messages to Tesla HQ that the motor was operating at low power. “Tesla called us up and told us that,” Sonnad said. “We didn’t notice any problems. It was super fast.” But Tesla had the company bring the car in, and it replaced the front motor.
The bigger issue, and the bigger question that everybody asks about, according to Sonnad, is battery degradation. That was my question too. The Tesloop Model S has only degraded about 6%, even though it’s being charged to 100% every day, rather than the default—and recommended—90% charge.
“For your daily driver, you don’t fully charge unless you’re doing a long trip,” Sonnad said. “We’re doing a long trip every day. We save, like, three minutes in charging in Barstow if we fully charge beforehand. We decided that we’re gonna suck it up, fully charge, and let it degrade. We figured that if it degraded enough, we could take it off a Vegas route and put it on a local Orange County route.”
Then, just as the car hit 200,000 miles, the range estimator became inaccurate. Though the car didn’t actually lose any range, the estimator would say it could go another ten miles—and then power down. Tesla looked into the issue, and told Tesloop that there’s a battery chemistry state that high-mileage cars go into, and the software isn’t properly compensating for that change. There will be a firmware update in three months that will take care of the discrepancy, but Tesla just replaced the battery to solve the problem. “We got our 6% range back with the new battery,” Sonnad said with a laugh. “But had the firmware been updated, we’d be fine and plugging along.”
Tesloop has paid to replace the car’s 12-volt battery for $190, and it buys sets of off-the-shelf 40,000-mile Goodyear tires pretty regularly, for a total of about $2,500 in the past year. And those are the only maintenance costs it’s had, thanks to Tesla’s unlimited 8-year warranty. “We haven’t even replaced the brakes,” Sonnad said.
I wondered if Tesloop, given how it’s using these cars, has any extra warranty or service deal with Tesla. “It’s nothing special; we’re under the standard warranties and everything,” Sonnad said. “We now have a lot of first-name friends in the service department, and we ask a lot of questions. And the car is in there for various inspections.”
He also noted that Tesloop’s car reached this mileage in just a year. It would take most people a decade to drive this many miles, and over that time it’s likely that a bunch of little things will fail. “I buy old cars personally, 20-year old cars, and things don’t work like they should on those cars,” Sonnad said. “There are issues like those that we didn’t encounter in one year, but not any in the drivetrain.”

855,Mercedes-Benz looks to the future with Generation EQ EV concept,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/29/mercedes-benz-looks-to-the-future-with-generation-eq-ev-concept/,2016/09/29,"
Mercedes-Benz is trying to play with your emotions with its new electric vehicle concept, debuted at the Paris Motor Show today. The “Generation EQ” it unveiled is a sporty SUV design, which is reminiscent of the Tesla Model X in its lines and overall look. It has a dual electric motor drive train, and a theoretical max range of around 310 miles, thanks to a scalable battery systems that maxes out at a total storage capacity of 300 kW.
You might know EQ as the acronym for emotional quotient, but for Mercedes, it stands for “Electric Intelligence,” though they’re fully aware of, and actively trying to invoke the emotional component, too. Mercedes explains in a press release about the vehicle’s unveiling that Generation EQ is the combination of its four-pillar mobility plan for the future, which focuses on connected, autonomous, shared and electric transportation methods.

As carmakers are wont to do, Mercedes-Benz gets pretty deep in the weeds in terms of flowery marketing language and aspirational visions of an idyllic future when describing the thinking behind the design. Cutting trough some of that crap, the basic takeaways are that the body design is supposed to look sporty, while also reducing drag for max power efficiency.
Inside, there’s a huge display for the driver,  plus seats and interior lighting that evoke nothing quite so much as Tron. Seat and internal structure design also look to be pared down with an eye to minimizing weight and maximizing effective use of the electric battery powerhouse. Like Volkswagen with its I.D. concept, Mercedes has decided to scrap the conventional wing mirrors in favor of cameras and displays integrated into the doors for views behind the car.

Also like VW, Mercedes is looking to use lights as a way to communicate with the driver, and with surroundings, starting with a welcome pattern that displays as the driver approaches. There’s also adaptive ambient lighting inside that the carmaker says will provided a “special feel-good atmosphere.”
Induction and wired charging options are both included, and Mercedes touts its own energy storage unit as a complement to owners with solar systems for keeping a power source handy. Driver assist features are powered by HERE maps, and data from on-board sensors. EQ also boasts  full complement of comms made to talk to smart city infrastructure and other vehicles, provided we can all get our stuff together enough to make that truly ubiquitous some day.
It’s probably a little too sci-fi for most, but I like the design of the EQ. But again, this is a concept vehicle – it likely won’t look like this if and when it ships as a production car. Still, it’s interesting to see where Mercedes believes transportation is heading, since if it truly believes in those four pillar concepts and pushing them forward, we’ll have a very different view of car ownership by the time the EQ hits the road.

856,Karamba Security raises $2.5 million to keep self-driving cars safe from hackers,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/29/karamba-security-raises-2-5-million-to-keep-self-driving-cars-safe-from-hackers/,2016/09/29,"
A cybersecurity startup based in Hod Hasharon, Israel, Karamba Security, has raised $2.5 million in new Series A funding to protect internet-connected cars and self-driving vehicles from hackers.
Fontinalis Partners, a venture firm that is focused on mobility and transportation-related technologies, led the investment joined by Karamba’s earlier seed backers YL Ventures and GlenRock.
Karamba has also released an extension to its “autonomous security” product suite.
As we’ve previously reported, Karamba’s system is installed on the electronic control units, or small computers, within a vehicle that are externally connected.
This can be done as a retrofit by automakers or before a new car is shipped, or by original equipment manufacturers.
For the unfamiliar, there is typically a single ECU that manages each different operation within a car, including critical things like braking, air bags or fuel injection, and less critical functions like navigation, air conditioning and entertainment.
Because the ECUs in a car operate on one network, which is self-contained within the vehicle, if hackers gain access to just one, they can get to any ECU.
Karamba’s software locks in the factory settings of each controller, and prevents foreign code and restricted behaviors from running there. Locking each ECU that way blocks a hacker’s ability to reach into a car’s CAN Bus, and mess with the car’s critical functions.
Remote access to the CAN Bus is what recently allowed Chinese security researchers to hack into a Tesla Model S from 12 miles away, and to interfere with the electronically-controlled features in the car, like its brakes, door locks and computer screen on its dashboard.
The newest extension to Karamba’s cybersecurity software ensures that no valid operations are blocked as false positives, impacting the safe operation of a vehicle when suspicious behaviors are identified.
The company’s funding and product announcements come following the release of a Federal Automated Vehicles Policy from the U.S. Department of Transportation and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration earlier this month.
The policy calls on autonomous vehicle makers and tech providers to prioritize safety, gather and share as much data as possible about the performance of their vehicles with each other and the government.
Fontinalis Partners’ Chris Thomas said the Series A investment in Karamba represents something of a milestone for his firm.
“We focus on mobility meaning the movement of people, goods and services powered by technology. We’ve invested in road, rail, bikes, marine and artificial intelligence technology but this is our first security deal,” he said.
Fontinalis’ portfolio also includes ridesharing pioneers Lyft, the self-driving car tech company nuTonomy, and mobile ticketing providers Masabi.
Thomas expects Karamba to use its new funding to make inroads with automotive companies, especially “tier 1” suppliers of components and technology to original equipment manufacturers.
He also expects the company to continue doing research and development that will keep it miles ahead of would-be vehicle hackers.
Long range, Thomas said, he can see Karamba’s cybersecurity software applying to self-flying drones, and other vehicles or robots that operate autonomously.

857,"Meet the I.D., Volkswagen’s first purely electric car on track for 2020",https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/28/meet-the-i-d-volkswagens-first-purely-electric-car-on-track-for-2020/,2016/09/28,"
Volkswagen did indeed debut its first dedicated electric car at the Paris Motor Show, as heavily teased. The I.D. revealed at the show is still labeled a “concept,” but VW says it’s due to become a buyable car in 2020, with a total range of ups to 373 miles per charge, driven by a 168hp electric motor.
The concept design for the I.D., which will be Volkswagen’s first purely electric design (as opposed to vehicles like the e-Golf which also offer a gas-powered option) also includes some even more future-focused features, including “I.D. Pilot mode,” a fully autonomous driving feature. The carmaker says its self-driving tech will be ready for production vehicles beginning in 2025, if things go as planned. In the same year, Volkswagen intends to cross the million electric cars sold mark, the company noted in a press release.

Autonomous capabilities help explain the interior design language of the I.D. concept, which VW’s PR describes as “the interactive center of a mobile lounge, or a supremely versatile Open Space.” This extremely indulgent marketing speak basically translates into a design that’s more flexible in case you don’t happen to have to be driving.
I.D. is also significant for being the first compact designed around VW’s Modular Electric Drive kit (MEB) architecture, which was created specifically for purely electric car models (as opposed to electric conversions of existing vehicles, again like the e-Golf).  The MEB is designed to be used in more car designs going forward, and is focused on maximizing vehicle ride comfort, safety, and use of space, with a floor-iterated flat battery pack, a long wheelbase and more.

Other aspects of the design also come from the focus a connected vehicle experience. There also aren’t any mirrors on the doors, and instead cameras built-in to the front fenders give you a look behind you left and right. B-pillars are gone, too, since the front and rear doors, when closed, provide enough structural rigidity on their own. This probably also helps with maximizing energy efficiency for better range.
The headlights actually sound like one of the more interesting aspects of the car – they’re designed as more thoughtful communication devices, and will “look” at the driver as they approach (which sounds max creepy), and signal when they’re in I.D. Pilot mode (from 2025 on obviously) with a different look, so other drivers know it’s driving itself. The lights also “look” in the direction the car intends to turn, and even “looks” at pedestrians and cyclists. All creepy when you think about a car doing this, but also pretty natural in terms of how we communicate with one another.
Somebody’s watching you…
VW’s I.D. Pilot self-driving tech uses lasers for primary detections, which are supplemented by ultrasonic, radar and photographic camera sensors. Traffic data is collected by individual cars and used to update a cloud-based model of real-time ground conditions, too, VW says.
It all sounds very lovely and future-focused, but it’s worth remembering that this is still just a concept, even if Volkswagen currently sounds very confident about that 2020 launch date. The self-driving system is even further away from being a reality, so bet to take all of this as a partial preview of what will actually arrive in a few years’ time.

We don’t yet know much about specific pricing or trim packages for the I.D., but Volkswagen says it’ll be “on a par with comparably powerful and well-equipped Golf models.” The current e-Golf starts at $28,995 U.S., so that’s probably a decent beginning point in terms of setting price expectations.

858,Didi Chuxing makes information security push with new U.S. research lab and hires,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/28/did-security/,2016/09/28,"
Didi Chuxing, China’s largest ride-hailing company, has hired two distinguished security experts to lead a new U.S.-based research center as part of a major push to increase its data security efforts.
Dr Fengmin Gong, whose 30 year work history includes starting Palo Alto networks, and Zheng Bu, who worked with Gong at FireEye and spent time with McAfee among employers, have taken key positions at the company, Didi announced today.
Gong becomes Didi’s VP of information security strategy and vice president of the company’s new U.S.-based Didi Research Institute. Bu will be based in China where he’ll work directly with Gong as Didi’s VP of information security operations. In that role, he’ll manage the company’s existing information security team in China.
Didi, which is in the process of acquiring Uber’s business in China, formally unveiled a China-based center in December 2015, but little is known about its U.S.-based branch. The company isn’t saying a great deal at this point.
A spokesperson said the center will be “a unit that helps to enable business inside rather than just focus on security” while Gong himself explained that he and Bu will “take responsibility for overall security” within the company.
“We have detailed plans we are working on,” Gong told TechCrunch. “Clearly Silicon Valley is best place to attract many talents [and a] much better vantage point to see the demands and needs across the globe.”
Gong has spent most of his life working in enterprise security environments, but he said that he and Bu were attracted to Didi principally because of the scale of the company’s business. Didi said this summer that it has over 14 million drivers and 300 million active users with 10 million rides completed on its service each day.
“The Didi platform and service it provides and number of people and partners in touches, presents probably the most sophisticated customer use case,” Gong explained. “[Bu and I] have been working in security for traditional enterprise, [this is the first opportunity] that represents a good blend of enterprise and new-age internet-based sharing economy. Plus we were very impressed by Didi’s ambition and ability to execute.”
Didi has an alliance with fellow Uber rivals Lyft in the U.S., Ola in India and Grab in Southeast Asia which includes a roaming deal for its users across different services and an exchange of information and best practices. While Didi’s deal with Uber has cast considerable doubt on the strength of that union, Gong said that he is “expecting” to engage in dialogue with those three companies as he settles into his new role.
Interestingly, driver and passenger fraud is one area that Gong said will fall under his reach. Beyond simply safeguarding the data and passengers and drivers — such as driving licenses and sensitive travel information — from outside threats and operational data security management, the new push will aim to cut down the massive problem of ride fraud.
With vast subsidies on offer for drivers and passengers, the Chinese internet is awash with offers to spoof rides and split the proceeds between fake rider and fake driver. This is an issue that has dogged both Didi and Uber China. Uber said last year that fraud accounts for 10 percent of all bookings in China, but experts have estimated the problem to be multiples higher. It isn’t clear how widely fraud impacts Didi’s business today after it raised prices and cut some subsidies following the Uber China deal, but Gong and his team will certainly “enable” business at Didi if they are able to stamp out even a fraction of fake rides.

859,Nvidia’s new Xavier SoC is an AI supercomputer for cars,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/28/nvidias-new-xavier-soc-is-an-ai-supercomputer-for-cars/,2016/09/28,"
Nvidia’s work in reinventing itself as a leader in automated-car technology continues with the launch of a new system-on-a-chip, called Xavier and launched today at the GPU Technology Conference Europe. The Xavier SoC manages 20 trillion operations per second, while only using 20 watts of power.
Xavier is designed to be used as an AI brain for use in self-driving cars specifically, and Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang told attendees at the conference that it’s “the greatest SoC endeavor” he’s ever encountered, which he notes is particularly meaningful given how long Nvidia has been in the business of making silicon.
Because it’s used in cars, Xavier was designed to meet the ISO 26262 functional safety spec, which is an international standard that sets expectations for electronics used in cars designed for road use. The SoC uses a 16nm manufacturing process, and just one can replace Nvidia’s current DRIVE PX 2 in-car computer, including a configuration of said component that includes two mobile SoCs and two discrete GPUs, while also using less power.
Xavier is intended for use by carmakers, suppliers, research organizations and startups looking to field and test their own self-driving cars. You won’t see it in any cars in the near future, however — Nvidia says it will start shipping the first samples in the fourth quarter of next year.
Meanwhile, Nvidia also teamed up with TomTom in a partnership that will see the two companies combining Nvidia’s AI platform and TomTom’s mapping data to provide real-time, localized mapping data for use in highway and freeway driving situations. Nvidia also demonstrated its own AI-based self-driving research vehicle, which learned how to drive itself based entirely on observing human driving behavior.
Clearly, Nvidia’s ambitions lie with autonomous driving, and it’s starting to look like its work in that area could eclipse its identity as a graphics hardware provider pretty quickly.

"
860,Watch Nvidia’s AI car drive itself using only what it learned from human drivers,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/28/watch-nvidias-ai-car-drive-itself-using-only-what-it-learned-from-human-drivers/,2016/09/28,"

There are multiple approaches to tackling self-driving; one is to program algorithms or rules that will tell a car how to behave in specific situations. Nvidia is using a deep learning approach, however, by providing its autonomous system with real-world data from humans drivers and letting it learn how to drive on its own – like a supercharged, AI-powered teenager getting behind the wheel using only their experience of being a passenger to guide them.
Like the average North American teenager, Nvidia’s test car (adorably named BB8, which must be an homage to Star Wars’ BB-8) began its learning in parking lots, navigating driving lanes demarcated by traffic cones. It then graduated to roads, and manages even tricky things like blind corners with seeming aplomb.
The demo video illustrates a few potential advantages of this approach: The system was trained in California but has no problem with test rides in New Jersey, even though the road and driving conditions are different; and it can handle driving even when marked lanes disappear, and at night, again seemingly without issue and without having been provided specific algorithmic rules for negotiating these scenarios.
Nvidia says this project was completed entirely on its own, independent of any carmakers, and that the next step is to continue training the system to make it smarter over time.

862,Uber-owned Otto to offer freight hauling services using autonomous trucks in 2017,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/27/uber-otto-freight-services-2017/,2016/09/27,"
Uber acquired self-driving lorry startup Otto this summer in a deal worth up to $680 million and it plans to put the company to work next year.
That’s according to comments from Otto co-founder Lior Ron, who told Reuters that Otto will enter the long-haul freight business in 2017. To recap, Otto’s technology allows existing trucks to be ‘retrofitted’ with self-driving technology which can handle driving on U.S. highways. It doesn’t entirely automate the process since human drivers are needed to negotiating coming on and off highways, but the technology may enable drivers to rest more and make their deliveries faster in the future.
The technology remains under development, but with Uber’s considerable resources now on board, Lior and his team aim to begin working with warehouses and stores to partially automate the driving process and generally improve efficiency.
“In Uber, you press a button and an Uber shows up after three minutes,” Ron told Reuters. “In freight … the golden standard is that it takes (the broker) five hours of phone calls to find your truck. That’s how efficient the industry is today.”
Uber is fast diversifying beyond its core business of transportation. Uber Eats, its food delivery business, is projected to grow massively worldwide with launches planned in at least 22 new countries, but experts Reuters talked to are more skeptical of its move into freight. For now though, Lior and his team are engaged in conversations with potential partners. The company plans to more than double its current fleet of six trucks to kick things off.

863,The OX is a flat-pack truck for the developing world,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/27/the-ox-is-a-flat-pack-truck-for-the-developing-world/,2016/09/27,"
The Global Vehicle Trust has revealed its OX prototype, a truck that can be flat-packed into itself for transportation anywhere in the world. When it arrives at its destination, the OX can be unpacked and assembled by a trained team of three professionals in about 12 hours. (Insert your own favorite IKEA joke here.)
The GVT was founded five years ago by British businessman and philanthropist Torquil Norman with the purpose of developing cost-effective transportation. He brought Gordon Murray on board, the man behind McLaren road cars, with the following brief: the vehicle has to have high ground clearance and generous approach and departure angles; its layout has to be configurable for multiple uses; and the cab has to fit three people.
And voila: OX. The version we’re seeing now is the XP3 prototype, which has received interest from aid agencies and Norman’s contacts in Africa. The GVT is raising money now to further fund the project to its completion.
The OX can be packed six to a shipping crate in its flat-pack form. Once assembled, the rear space can hold up to 10 people or eight 44-gallon drums. The front cab does indeed seat three, with the driver in the center so the vehicle can be used in countries that drive on the left or right side of the road.
Even assembled, the OX is a bit of a transformer. The bases of the rear bench seats can be removed and placed under the wheels for traction in sandy terrain. The tailgate slides off and can be turned lengthwise to be used as a loading ramp. The OX’s dry weight is a substantial 1,600 kg (3,527 lbs), and it can haul a payload up to 1,900 kg (4,188 lbs) with its 2.2-liter diesel engine. The two-wheel-drive vehicle has been engineered to perform as well as a four-wheel-drive vehicle, an important consideration in areas where roads are not maintained or are nonexistent.
The goal now is to make the OX a reality. As Norman said in a press release:
“Our priority now is to raise the funding to complete the testing and take the project to fruition. We believe that the OX has huge potential for charities, aid organisations and development programmes. My dream is to one day see an OX in every village in Africa.”

GM’s Maven has begun rolling out one-way car sharing for its members in Ann Arbor and Detroit, letting users pick up vehicles and use them to get between Ann Arbor and the University of Michigan, and between Detroit and the Detroit Metro airport. The one-way service is a big advantage for car-sharing services, as it means users don’t have to worry about planning their return trip.
One-way means members can pick up their rental vehicles in one location and drop them off somewhere else, rather than having to bring them back to where they originally began their rental. Zipcar and has been offering one-way service for a little while now after beginning as exclusively round-trip, rolling out first in Boston in 2014 and then gradually adding other cities over time. Maven’s rollout is starting where its service first began, but COO Dan Grossman tells me via email that the company will “assess city to city” and expand gradually from that beginning point.
Asked whether or not this was always on the roadmap, or whether it was launched in response to user feedback about the service, Grossman said that it was the result of both. “[W]e assumed we could layer this service on top of round trip,” he said, but the possibility of one-way also got great feedback when floated with members.

Other car-sharing services rely on even more flexibility for rentals as a key competitive advantage. Daimler’s car2go, for instance, offers not only one-way, but also free parking at specified locations and drop-offs in city-run lots, depending on the system in place for a particular city.
Any kind of one-way offering is a vast improvement over a rigorous round-trip-only offering, however, so Maven’s move today is definitely smart. Maven also continues to grow, having quickly expanded to five cities since launching earlier this year.

Microsoft has already expressed some interest on bringing Office to the car, and it sounds like it’ll continue to do that work with Renault-Nissan via a new tie-up between the two companies. The newly formed strategic partnership will see Microsoft help the automaker develop more connectivity services, particularly through the use of Azure cloud services.
What does the partnership actually aim to do? A joint press release from the two companies breaks it down, noting that it’ll help with creating, securing and transferring driver profiles and settings from one car to another; that it will support productivity software integration into the car; that it’ll provide a route for over-the-air software updates for things like autonomous drive software; that it can help car owners monitor their vehicles from a distance; and more.
The key things to pay attention to here are how Microsoft is working with carmakers to extend the reach of Office and its productivity software to inside the car. In the short-term, this makes sense in terms of providing drivers with suggestions about destinations and phone calls to make based on their schedule; Microsoft has already detailed features like this in another similar partnership with Mercedes.
Long-term, getting a foothold in the car will pave the way for future scenarios where drivers can be even more fully engaged with Office software, since their vehicle is handling the driving for them.
Another key point here is that Nissan-Renault is expressing its intent to update car software via OTA means in the future, which is similar to how Tesla handles updates to its own in-car experience today. This is likely to become the new norm, especially if Tesla can successfully scale up to becoming another automaker shipping millions of vehicles per year, and its approach to software continues to resemble what it’s doing today.

Crowdsourcing live traffic data has been one of Waze’s key competitive advantages in navigation software for a while, but Germany’s HERE might give it a run for its money with new services that pull traffic info from cars on the road.
The data gathered by Here’s upcoming traffic services, which it’s set to debut during the first half of 2017, will take info from company co-owners BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen (who acquired HERE from Nokia last year), with plans to bring more carmakers into the network. Data gathered will include “detailed video views” of things like traffic tie-ups, accidents, fog or other inclement weather and construction slow-downs, according to Reuters.
The data collected also includes braking info, windshield wiper activation, headlight use, location info and other sensors, all of which will be used to help create an alert system that will be translated to other vehicles via HERE’s dashboard services. HERE says that this will give it an advantage over other mapping providers, including Google, Apple and Tesla, because of the volume of their fleet. And, since it depends on passive transmission of data from cars, into which it’s actually integrated, it should also help it exceed Waze’s volunteer network of active reporting participants.
HERE doesn’t make mention of this, but this system could be instrumental in helping pave the way for autonomous driving systems. One of the key ingredients to successfully fielding self-driving vehicles is dealing with real-time road conditions, which are always changing, and any system that can provide insight on that with a scale of millions of vehicles feeding in info will definitely prove an advantage there.

Google issued the following statement with details about the crash:
“A Google vehicle was traveling northbound on Phyllis Ave. in Mountain View when a car heading westbound on El Camino Real ran a red light and collided with the right side of our vehicle. Our light was green for at least six seconds before our car entered the intersection. Thousands of crashes happen everyday on U.S. roads, and red-light running is the leading cause of urban crashes in the U.S. Human error plays a role in 94% of these crashes, which is why we’re developing fully self-driving technology to make our roads safer.”
Two local TV stations, KRON and KPIX, reported that the Google autonomous vehicle had been “in control,” or in its self-driving mode at the time of the crash.
However, the self-driving car was reportedly manned by a Google employee who took over its operation, and applied the brakes when the other car’s driver began crossing an intersection, apparently running a red light and colliding with Google’s vehicle.
The crash comes just after the U.S. Department of Transportation made some major autonomous vehicle policy announcements earlier this week, as TechCrunch then reported.
Among other things, the DOT called on self-driving auto makers and related technology firms to prioritize safety, and share data with the government and each other within reason.
Google issues reports voluntarily every month reflecting data on the number of miles their autonomous vehicles have traveled, how many cars they have on the road, and details about any accidents in which they were involved.
Generally, DOT officials say they want to ensure the U.S. can be a leader rather than a laggard in autonomous vehicles, while protecting the traveling public.
 
Updates: This post has been updated with Google’s official statement about the accident. Earlier, the post’s headline was edited to emphasize that a human driver ran a red light and collided with Google’s self-driving vehicle.

Smart cities are boring. Give us responsive cities.
In the smart city race, we’re betting on transit




Cities have always been hubs of technological experimentation, shaped by the people who inhabit them and the tools they use. We can still see the marks, both charming and garish, from technologies of years past — from old aqueducts to telephone booths to the damage done by cars.
The next wave of real-time technologies that will define the next decade are software (rather than hardware) upgrades to the city that will nonetheless transform the way we work, play and live in our physical environments — our “brick and mortar” cities. And these technologies, each transformative in their own right, when used in combination to develop new products and experiences, will have a multiplying effect on the rate of change we see in urban environments. (And clearly, in the future, all technologies will have two-letter acronyms.)
Fifth-generation wireless (5G)
5G is just a marketing term right now, but there is no denying that mobile data consumption is exploding, and all of our future technologies will require vastly faster, ubiquitous wireless connectivity. Demands on networks are doubling every year. At this rate, with a bit of quick math, we can see that in the next decade we will have 1,000x the demand for mobile data.
To meet these skyrocketing demands, we need to densify the mobile networks of years past. This means moving from macrocell sites that cover neighborhoods to small cells that cover blocks, down to femtocells and picocells that bring high speed, synchronized connectivity to your home and human-scale settings. Bandwidth has become the lifeblood of cities as much as water, good roads or electricity have supported thriving cities in the past. It’s really the base technology that all others are built on. Look for ubiquitous gigabit-speed wireless in leading cities over the next decade.
Computer vision (CV)
Of all the sensors available, video-as-a-sensor will emerge as the most important tool — and maybe the most controversial — for helping us understand cities over the next decade. Sound, air quality and others are important, but CV allows the broadest range of possibilities and supports the greatest number of possible use cases. From understanding density of populations, to usage patterns, to speed of traffic, to how resources are being used, CV will quite literally be the eyes of the city.
The real power of these technologies will be unlocked when we combine them.
This comes with well-warranted concerns for privacy, but with pioneers like Intel managing tight security and on-device processing, and Movidius promising insanely detailed chip-based object recognition, there’s reason to believe we’ll arrive at a scenario that protects our privacy. And if you can’t imagine the city being covered in cameras, take a look around and count the number of cameras already in the city. Nearly every store, street corner, cab and cop has a camera. The change will occur in swapping out the human who reviews a recording today for a computer that processes the images instead.
The innovation will happen when this computer-generated data can be shared safely and securely across the city to foster new combinatorial innovations. For instance, it could support a real-time 3D map of the city that could be used for guiding autonomous vehicles around children playing in the street, supply city planning departments with real-time data on resource utilization or help business owners understand customer trends and create more responsive services and offerings. If 5G provides the base connectivity layer required for cities to evolve, CV will provide the understanding and “ground truth” of what’s going on.
Mixed reality (MR)
Where virtual reality, augmented reality and plain-old reality mix together to bring digital overlays that incorporate real physics and computer graphics and create immersive experiences with the best of the physical and digital, we call this mixed reality. MR has perhaps the most limitless possibilities of all five technologies listed here, and likely will serve as the eventual replacement to the mobile phone.
From virtual goods that reduce strains on our resources to overlays on the world for entertainment, education and work, MR has astounding implications. With the help of companies like Samsung, Google and Magic Leap, use cases and interfaces that Google Glass or Pokémon Go have hinted at will transform into seamless, natural combinations of the internet, physical city infrastructure and society. Imagine changing the architecture of a city on-the-fly, or making certain information about yourself visible to different circles, like your relationship status in a dating-overlay or your blood type and heart rate for first responders.
Autonomous vehicles (AV)
We have more than one billion cars on the planet. That’s trillions of dollars of rapidly depreciating infrastructure sitting on the streets, used for only a fraction of its life. And even when cars are used, their most efficient use (when driven close to capacity at the top of their performance profile) happens briefly and rarely, like when you are loaded up with kids and all your stuff from your summer vacation.
These real-time software technologies will drive the greatest rate of change in cities over the next decade.
We have given these cars billions of square feet of prime real estate in cities around the world. Autonomous vehicles not only have the potential to change the idea of car ownership and last-mile travel, but also radically change the way we manage logistics and delivery of goods. We will see cities’ use of space and people’s travel habits change dramatically over the next decade, enabled by changes to vehicle sizes and the addition of intelligent routing, breaking down car travel into everything from package-delivering drones (think Amazon Prime Air or Starship), to micro-buses making commutes efficient and cheap, to intelligent, tiny, easy-to-use single-person rideables.
Artificial intelligence (AI)
We need brains to bring these technologies together and make them work. And we’re not talking about order-taking robots or computers we need to program with every detail. AI should let us manage by objective: tell the system what we want to achieve, help it when it needs it and course correct it as it goes along.
With learning systems that can scale massively in scope via cloud computing and maintain responsiveness across billions of interactions on the most minute level via in-device edge processing, AI is the most unpredictable and existential technology of the bunch. It has the potential to bring things together to help us solve critical macro issues — we can use AI to make vastly better use of our resources, solve equity issues and prevent crime — and the smaller, more personal challenges, like finding a better way to get to work, meet a mate or optimize your schedule to better suit your desired lifestyle.

Sure, there are lots of other breakthrough “physical” technologies out there, from 3D printing to micro housing. But, it’s 1,000,000,000 times harder to move an atom than an electron, so we think these real-time software technologies will drive the greatest rate of change in cities over the next decade.
Think of them as your five basic ingredients with which you can build an infinite range of recipes. The real power of these technologies will be unlocked when we combine them — 5G-connected AVs, utilizing data sourced from the city via CV sensors to anticipate obstacles in real time, using AI to process the data and coordinate with other AVs for maximal street-level effectiveness, all while passengers look out a virtual MR window onto their individualized city (two-letter acronyms are the future!).
Keep your eyes open and you’ll see these five technologies popping up in development today, and then gradually becoming a core part of pretty much all of our interactions with each other and the city over the next 10 years.

871,Smart’s entire car lineup will have an electric drive option in 2017,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/23/smarts-entire-car-lineup-will-have-an-electric-drive-option-in-2017/,2016/09/23,"
At some point, it’ll probably be commonplace, but as of its 2017 model year, Smart will be the only big car brand that can truthfully claim to offer both an electric drive and a gas-powered option across all of its vehicle offerings. The Daimler-owned maker of pint-sized urban cars will offer an EV version of its Fortwo, Fortwo Cabrio and Forfour in 2017, and each one will use a brand new Smart Electric Drive platform, built by Mercedes-Benz in partnership with Renault-Nissan.
The electric versions of the Smart cars aren’t range monsters, but offer 99 miles per EP ratings via their 17.6 kWH capacity, which is more than enough for the average city-dweller’s daily commute. Plus, you can actually get a full charge in just about two-and-a-half hours, instead of the longer charge times required for big capacity batteries using standard voltage outlets.

872,AutoMobility LA announces its top 10 startups,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/22/automobility-la-announces-its-top-10-startups/,2016/09/22,"
AutoMobility LA, the new name for the press days before the public LA Auto Show in November, has announced the ten startups competing for visibility and mentoring opportunities. The board that chooses the finalists includes executives from companies small and large, new and old: Lyft, Google, NVIDIA, Local Motors, and General Electric, among others.
The startups that made the list cover a wide range of automotive technologies, from cybersecurity to ride hailing to service apps. There are no automakers like Elio Motors this year, but there is one company that is building foldable scooters for last-mile commuting.
Here are the top ten:



Argus Cyber Security, a company that provides a ready-to-embed, cybersecurity solution suite for automobiles and aftermarket connectivity platforms.

EverCharge Inc., a large scale multi-vehicle EV charging system that makes EV ownership accessible for everyone.

HAAS Alert, a mobile vehicle-to-vehicle platform that delivers preemptive notifications to motorists and the car itself.

LISNR, Inc, a company that develops ultrasonic communication technology between phone and car using existing hardware for keyless access, car payments, and vehicle personalization.

PolySync, an operating system built for the high-bandwidth, high-compute requirements of fully autonomous driving.

See Jane Go, a ridesharing app by women for women that ensures safety and trust, which is currently lacking in many existing ride-hail apps.

Spatial.ai, a geospatial app that provides users with the culture and flavor of urban areas through big data analysis of social media.

Spira4u Co., an alternative to the automotive market, built for safety, affordability, and eco-friendliness made primarily from high density foam.

URBAN626, a company that creates lightweight, foldable, personal vehicles for last-mile travel. URB-E travels up to 15 mph, has a 20-mile range and folds to fit conveniently in a bus, train, or car trunk.

YourMechanic, an on-demand marketplace for finding the best reputable mechanics and bringing them directly to your car.


All of these companies will be exhibiting at AutoMobility LA in the Technology Pavilion. The LA Auto Show has had a Connected Car Expo for the past few years, but this is a pivot toward the future of transportation that puts more emphasis on technology, cleaner fuels, and shared ownership. It seems that the LA Auto Show is setting itself up for a time when auto shows as we know them will be obsolete.
It’s also likely its organizers feel CES breathing down their necks. In 2016, there were more than 100 automotive tech companies at CES, and nine automotive manufacturers with huge auto-show-style displays and press events. Detroit is feeling the pressure too. The North American International Auto Show, which butts up against CES on the calendar in January, has a new AutoMobili-D space to showcase autonomous and connected vehicles as well as Mobility as a Service (MaaS).
Back to AutoMobility and these top ten startups. Three of these companies will be mentored on stage at the event by investor Bill Tai, and from those three, an ultimate winner will be announced. That team will attend the final celebration of the 2017 Extreme Tech Challenge, where they can rub elbows with those competitors and judges on Sir Richard Branson’s Necker Island.

873,Uber rival Grab partners with Nutonomy to test self-driving cars in Singapore,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/22/grab-nutonomy/,2016/09/22,"
Fresh from raising $750 million in new financing this week, Uber rival in Southeast Asia Grab is now making a move into the self-driving car space after it agreed to a partnership with NuTonomy, the MIT spin-out that is developing autonomous vehicles.
NuTonomy gained attention for beating Uber to publicly testing self-driving cars when it switched on a pilot in Singapore in August — just before Uber began tests in Pittsburgh, U.S.. Its agreement with Grab will see it extend that trial by including customers from Grab in the testing phase for an initial two months.
NuTonomy’s pilot is limited to one part of Singapore — a 2.5km square business district area called ‘One North’ that the government designated to testing self-driving cars — but Grab passengers are permitted to go beyond those boundaries and take a trip into nearby neighborhoods. In that case, one of the supervisors overseeing the autonomous vehicle will take the wheel to complete the journey.
Despite raising over $1.3 billion from investors to date, Grab has not focused self-driving cars in the same way as Uber. In fact, the press release for its funding this week made no reference to self-driving cars or autonomous technology. While it is true that the infrastructure in most of the six countries that it serves in Southeast Asia are some way from being able to support the technology, the fact that autonomous vehicles are emerging in Singapore — Grab’s HQ and a market where the government has thrust its weight behind the idea — might be enough to get its attention.

Nutonomy co-founder and CEO Karl Iagnemma with Grab Singapore head Lim Kell Jay
A Grab spokesperson told TechCrunch that the tie-in with NuTonomy does not include an investment in either party, so for now this looks purely like a partnership play. Grab gets to see what state autonomous vehicle technology is at, while NuTonomy gains the benefits of Grab’s tech resources for routing, managing supply/demand, mapping and more.
Grab indicated to us that it has an interest in offering self-driving cars in other parts of Southeast Asia in the long run, but for now Singapore is the primary focus.
“This landmark tech partnership is a step towards supplementing Singapore’s transport network with an innovative driverless commuting option for underserved areas of Singapore — all accessible through the Grab app,” Grab CEO and co-founder Anthony Tan said in a statement.
NuTonomy raised $18 million earlier this year from investors that included the Singapore Economic Development Board. The company is running trials in the UK and U.S. and it hopes to introduce a fully commercial self-driving ‘robo’ taxi fleet by 2018.

We asked Grab a couple of addition questions around the deal.
TechCrunch: Is Grab developing its own self-driving technology outside of this partnership?
Grab: Self-driving vehicles (SDVs) are a nascent technology and concept in Singapore and all around the world. We believe that partnering with NuTonomy, the leading SDV software developer, will enable us to research and refine the SDV user experience, study the application of SDVs in Singapore, as well as improve the efficiency of matching SDVs to passengers.
Grab’s app platform is robust, highly scalable and widely used by commuters in Singapore. We have a strong understanding of Singapore commuter’s travel patterns and behaviors, we have one of the most accurate maps in Singapore that is updated constantly to ensure location accuracy, and we have built a robust fleet routing technology. These are critical components to move SDV from a trial phase into a real-world application. We believe that SDVs are a complementary service and an innovative solution to enhance the efficiency of Singapore’s land transport network, particularly where additional first-mile and last-mile connectivity is needed — as well as in underserved neighborhoods.
Grab and NuTonomy bring complementary skillsets to the table. NuTonomy has proven expertise in building software for self-driving vehicles, while Grab has the know-how in fleet routing technology and localized mapping. By each focusing on our core strengths, we can more effectively create the most robust e-hailing platform for self-driving vehicles.
TC: Are there plans to expand this trial to other countries outside of Singapore in the future?
Grab: Singapore is the ideal test bed for SDVs due to its more advanced infrastructure and strong government support. It will be a longer runway for SDVs to be a viable transport service in other SEA cities, and Grab will continue to offer multiple transport services that meet the local needs of consumers, such as taxis, cars or bikes.

874,Tesla sues Michigan state officials over denial of direct sales and service,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/22/tesla-sues-michigan-state-officials-over-denial-of-direct-sales-and-service/,2016/09/22,"
Tesla has filed suit with the Western District Court of Michigan over its ability to sell its cars directly to consumers in the state, Electrek reports, as well as its ability to service vehicles owned by state residents. The lawsuit follows the rejection of an application for a dealership license earlier this month, and lines up with Tesla’s stated goal of pursuing the right to sell its vehicles directly to customers across the U.S.
Vehicle sales in the U.S. still primarily depend on a franchise dealership model, wherein licensed third-parties handle the actual sales of cars from auto manufacturers. Tesla has been trying to upend that model, preferring to have full, direct control over the showrooms, dealerships and customer relationships throughout the sales process.
Tesla operates showrooms in many states, but isn’t allowed to sell its vehicles directly via these locations. Instead, it relies heavily on online sales, including direct delivery to customer doors. In Michigan, the car-maker has been barred from even operating a showroom or served center, which is understandably frustrating to Tesla given Michigan’s population, as well as its identity as the home of America’s automotive manufacturing prowess.
Tesla named Michigan Secretary of State, Attorney General and Governor directly in the suit as defendants, as each had a hand in passing amendments to state laws that effectively shut down any possibility of Tesla owning and operating its own stores in Michigan. Tesla is looking for a jury trial, according to the suit, and expedited proceedings, as well as a permanent induction on state officials on enforcing the section of the law it says was passed specifically to bar Tesla’s dealership application.

875,This new electric car is designed for a $37 weekly subscription service,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/22/this-new-electric-car-is-designed-for-a-37-weekly-subscription-service/,2016/09/22,"
Europe continues to test the waters of shared vehicle ownership models, and the Amber One is a car designed to help eliminate the huge amount of time our own vehicles currently spend idle. The all-electric concept has a 250-mile range on a single charge, a top speed of over 93 mph, and a 0 to 60 time of a respectable 7 seconds. But you can’t buy one – to gain access, you subscribe to a service at a cost of €33 (around $37 U.S.) per week, which will let you use any available Amber One nearby.
The car itself looks similar to another vehicle recently unveiled designed for shared use – Spiri’s first EV prototype, designed specifically to maximize value for its on-demand carpooling service. There’s a reason for the similarity, as both service models will benefit from having a lightweight, energy-efficient all-electric car that can manage frequent trips but also fit in easily on crowded European roadways.
Amber Mobility says the Amber One is also designed to be modular, so that it can be upgraded throughout its life, which should be prolonged because it doesn’t need to be scrapped entirely when new tech or improvements come along. It’s also designed as a connected car from the ground up, with tight integration across software and hardware, according to the company, which will help reduce overall operating costs. Plus, eventually, the plan is to build in semi- and full autonomous driving capabilities, which Amber says will reduce costs associated with accidents and damage.

Car ownership basically sucks for all involved, and as Lyft co-founder John Zimmer recently pointed out, individually owned cars sit idle up to 96 percent of the time, which is massively wasteful in terms of allocated space, infrastructure, expense and eventual waste generated. Amber Mobility’s model hopes to address that, while retaining the convenience factor with a “guarantee” that an Amber One will be available “within walking distance at any time” to users of its service.
The Amber One is set to enter production in 2018, with prototypes hitting the road next year. Service will initially kick off for corporate partners in limited pilots at the end of this year, but consumer rollout of the service is expected in 2018, beginning in Amber’s home turf of Eindhoven, the Netherlands.

876,Aria Systems launches automotive recurring revenue platform,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/21/aria-systems-launches-automotive-recurring-revenue-platform/,2016/09/21,"
Aria Systems is bringing together the chocolate of usage- and subscription-based revenue opportunities with the peanut butter of increasingly connected automotive systems. The resulting candy (to complete this metaphor) that launched this week is Aria for Connected Vehicles.
This is a cloud-based monetization platform for connected cars, on-demand transportation, telematics and more. Basically, Aria can help facilitate any service that users pay for based on usage (like car sharing) or a subscription (like in-car Wi-Fi).
For more than a century, auto manufacturers have built vehicles to be sold once. One car, one customer, one purchase — until they’re ready to buy another car in a few years. Connected vehicles, IoT and automotive services are opening up these recurring revenue opportunities, but manufacturers aren’t moving quickly enough on their own to take advantage, according to Aria.
Aria Systems has been around since 2003, which can seem like a century in the San Fransisco area, where the company is based. The company has been specializing in secure, cloud-based software for recurring billing since then.
Aria for Connected Vehicles can be used by the manufacturers themselves — Subaru and Audi are already on board — or by third-party device manufacturers or services, like Zipcar and Edmunds.com. It works with smartphone apps, payment processors and existing accounting systems. When used with a smartphone app, Aria also holds customer credit card information with “bank-rate security,” for easier PCI compliance, according to the press release.
The system has as many uses as there are usage models, it seems. It can facilitate hourly on-demand access to vehicles, whether that’s a fleet of shared cars or heavy machinery. It can track mileage for usage-based vehicle taxes. It can also sell analytics of driver patterns to “cities, planners, DOTs, insurers, [and] consumers.” Aria for Connected Vehicles can help transition from cars as owned objects to mobility as a service.

877,Apple could also be in talks to acquire Lit Motors,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/21/apple-could-also-be-in-talks-to-acquire-lit-motors/,2016/09/21,"
Apple is rumored to be in talks to acquire McLaren, but that’s not all. While the New York Times was digging on the McLaren story, they also found out that Apple is also talking with Lit Motors for a potential acquisition.
Now you might be thinking “Lit who?” While Lit Motors is nowhere as big as McLaren, it’s another interesting company in the automotive space.
The company participated in the Startup Battlefield at TechCrunch Disrupt SF back in 2012. At the time, the team had an impressive on-stage demo, allowing them to finish at the second place.
The San Francisco-based startup is developing a new kind of electric vehicle. It’s a sort of electric motorcycle with a few tricks up its sleeve. In particular, you can’t tip it over because it uses gyros to stabilize itself.
Sure, gyros have become quite common with the so-called hoverboards. But it’s still impressive to try and kick over a big vehicle like this one and see that it doesn’t move an inch.
According to CrunchBase, the company has only raised $2.2 million in total. It’s unclear if the company still has money today to survive as an independent entity or if it has been looking for an acquirer.
Apple has been working on a car project for a few years now. While it’s still a secretive project, there are plenty of rumors going around. In particular, the company is fighting with many other car and tech companies for talent.
Acquiring Lit Motors could be a great way to have a few talented engineers join the car project. We’ve reached out to Lit Motors and will update this post if we hear back. In the meantime, please enjoy Lit Motors’ 2012 pitch:

And, as first reported by Business Insider, Mercury Public Affairs senior vice president Drew Olanoff caught a black self-driving car making a left turn on Market Street near the Embarcadero at 6:45 a.m.
Other startup workers have been mentioning the sightings in the downtown area on social media as well, igniting suspicions this isn’t a one-off test.


Spotted @uber self driving car in SF. @travisk is #SF next?
— Jason Van der Schyff (@vanderjas) September 21, 2016



These self-driving cars seen in downtown SF seem to be the same as those used in Uber’s self-driving pilot program in Pittsburgh. Uber recently deployed a fleet of 14 Ford Fusions equipped with radar, cameras and other sensing equipment developed by researchers from Carnegie Mellon University’s robotics center.

Pittsburgh Uber users are now able to opt in to hailing one of these 14 autonomous vehicles in town. But an Uber spokesperson tells TechCrunch that’s not the case with the self-driving cars spotting in SF.
“A handful of cars equipped with advanced driver safety and self-driving technology are now being tested in the Bay Area. These are for internal research use only. They will have a test driver upfront and will not be part of our ridesharing service. Testing in different environments is critical to the future success of this technology, which will help dramatically improve road safety,” Uber said.
So how long until riders here can choose to try out one of Uber’s self-driving cars? Uber said it didn’t have a timeline but did add it would keep us posted. We’ll be sure to let you know as soon as we hear more.

879,"Apple is in talks with McLaren for a potential acquisition, report says",https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/21/apple-is-in-talks-with-mclaren-for-a-potential-acquisition-report-says/,2016/09/21,"
Apple, the tech company, is negotiating with McLaren, the car manufacturer, according to the Financial Times. Yes, you’ve read that correctly. These negotiations have been ongoing for months and could lead to an acquisition, or at least a strategic investment.
More precisely, Apple is talking with McLaren Technology Group, the parent company of all things McLaren, including McLaren Automotive.
While McLaren is a famous name in the world of supercars and Formula One, it isn’t a gigantic car manufacturing company. The company reported $617 million in revenue (£475 million) for the entire year of 2015, representing $27 million in net profit (£20.8 million).
The FT thinks this acquisition could cost between $1.3 billion and $2 billion (between £1 billion and £1.5 billion). While this seems like a significant acquisition for Apple, the company has made a bigger acquisition in the past with Beats.
In particular, when it comes to automotive, rumor has it that Apple has been working on a secret car project for years.
Bob Mansfield recently took over the car division at Apple. The company also recently made a $1 billion investment into Didi Chuxing.
While Apple engineers are hard at work on self-driving technology, manufacturing a car is still uncharted territory for the tech company. Acquiring McLaren could be a way to hire many engineers who know how to make cars, engines, chassis and more.
This is still an early report and the acquisition talks could still fall through. Either way, it’s interesting to see that Apple wants to be a serious player in the car space.
Update: McLaren told the BBC that the company isn’t having any investment discussion with Apple right now.


McLaren: ""We can confirm McLaren is not in discussion with Apple in respect of any potential investment""
— Adam Parsons (@AdamParsons1) September 21, 2016



Independently, the NYT confirmed that Apple and McLaren have been talking about a potential investment. McLaren’s statement could mean that it’s an acquisition (not an investment), it has closed (not in discussion) or the discussion has ended.

880,Tesla 8.0 software update with new Autopilot features begins rolling out tonight,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/21/tesla-8-0-software-update-with-new-autopilot-features-begins-rolling-out-tonight/,2016/09/21,"
Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk just revealed that the 8.0 update which includes big Autopilot improvements will begin going live for Model S and Model X owners later tonight. The over-the-air update brings a host of improvements, which add up to what Musk calls “a major overhaul on almost every level compared to V7.”


V8.0 starts downloading tonight. Release will be gradual to make sure there aren't small regressions. Many car configs, many environments.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 21, 2016



Version 8.0 of Autopilot includes huge changes to how the object detection system works, using radar to help detect things that might not get picked up by the camera vision sensors on the vehicle. The new radar functionality will work with any Tesla vehicles made in 2014 and following, which already have the necessary components on-board to enable the new detection features.
Musk explained in a conference call on September 11 that the new radar features will allow Autopilot to detect any decently sized, dense object, even in adverse weather conditions that might obscure them from Tesla’s camera arrays. The new changes likely would’ve prevented the fatal May 7 accident that resulted in the death of Model S owner Josh Brown, Musk explained on the call.
Besides the Autopilot changes, Musk notes that there are plenty of other new software features coming to vehicle owners. These include one of the biggest overhauls yet to the car software’s UI, as well as Musk’s “favorite” new feature, an always-on max temperature setting that will prevent overheating for children and pets left in the car from overheating by automatically airing out the car’s interpret and turning on the AC when it detects temperature will extend beyond 40C or 105F.


Tesla keeps temp below 40C/105F by automatically venting cabin & turning on AC when needed. Can do this for up to a year on a full charge.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 21, 2016



The 8.1 update to come at a later date will also let users set their own min and max temperatures to engaged the automatic temperature control, Musk noted on Twitter.
Tesla owners should look out for the update, which Electrek notes will also bring a complete overhaul to the media app, with better search and shortcuts to favorite streaming apps, among other changes.

881,"Pay-per-mile insurance startup Metromile raises $191.5M, acquires Mosaic Insurance",https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/21/pay-per-mile-insurance-startup-metromile-raises-191-5m-acquires-mosaic-insurance/,2016/09/21,"
The automotive industry is in flux with the rise of self-driving and electric cars, and the concept of car ownership altogether being thrown into question. With this, the car insurance industry is changing, too, and now, an on-demand car insurance startup has raised a large round of funding as it aims to be leader of that change.
Metromile, the provider that lets you pay-per-mile for insurance, said that it has raised a whopping $191.5 million in funding — “primarily equity”, according to CEO Dan Preston. Metromile will use the money to acquire an insurance carrier called Mosaic Insurance to handle the underwriting of its policies itself; as well as to expand new states in the U.S. and continue building its platform.
Preston declined to disclose the company’s valuation with its latest round.
As notable as the size of Metromile’s funding is the list of investors behind it. They include a couple of insurance giants, Canada’s Intact Financial and China Pacific Insurance (CPIC); top VCs Index Ventures, New Enterprise Associates (NEA), First Round Capital, Mitsui and SV Angel; Metromile founder and Chairman David Friedberg (of Climate Corporation fame); and Mark Cuban.
The funding is a surprising and large boost for a company that has been around since 2011 but has seemingly only raised $14 million before now. (And to be clear, the $191.5 million being announced today is actually three rounds rolled into one. CEO Dan Preston tells me it includes a Series D funding of $103.1 million; an additional strategic investment of $50 million from China Pacific Insurance; and a Series C financing from late 2014 that was never made public, of $38.4 million.)
In the interim, Metromile has acquired licenses to operate in all 50 U.S. states although it’s currently only underwriting policies in four: New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Virginia. With the funding, that underwriting will expand to California, Illinois and Washington, and beyond.
“We will start accelerating our state roll out at the beginning of 2017,” Preston said. “For the time being, our focus is on the huge opportunity for per-mile insurance in the US but we’re excited about exploring global opportunities with partners in the future.”
Metromile sells its insurance directly to those who will be using it, but one of the big ways that it can acquire those users is through alliances with others. So far there has been only one of these, with the ridesharing behemoth Uber, which partnered with the startup in 2015 to provide an option for insurance coverage for those times when you are not carrying a passenger (which falls under a different insurance scheme).
Preston says that it’s continuing to work with Uber and the change over to Metromile underwriting all of its own insurance — a result of the Mosaic acquisition — will not impact Uber drivers “for the time being.”
“We are focused on moving our personal business over first. The new claims experience is currently only available for Metromile’s personal policies,” he said. “Uber driver-partner policies will continue to be underwritten by insurers in the National General Insurance Group and their coverage will not be compromised in any way.”
Miles ahead
Metromile has carved out a reputation for disrupting some of the more obvious inefficiencies of the standard insurance business model and the pricing that has been developed around it.
“Sixty-five percent of drivers pay higher premiums to subsidize the minority who drive the most,” Preston explained. The cases where this is perhaps most acute are in cities where people are not entirely dependent to their cars. “Our go to market strategy is focused on large urban areas and aimed at developing a brand with each city that we roll out into. The people who switch to pay-per-mile insurance commute differently. They take multiple forms of public transit, walk, bike or even ride-share to work so a usage based option makes more sense to them.”
While Metromile is tapping into some of the bigger changes that are taking place in the world of transportation, taking on traditional big providers like Geico, Progressive and State Farm, it’s not the only one. There are many of other companies offering pay-as-you-go car insurance right now, including those same huge insurance conglomerates through to startups (some of which have closed due to competition from the large players).
Preston says that the others are different because they use other instruments to measure a driver’s actions to provide a rate.
“What many people call pay as you go insurance is actually behavioral based insurance,” he said. “Metromile is the only multi-state per-mile insurance product and does not rate based on behavior other than miles driven.” Metromile’s model reduces insurance costs for low-mileage drivers by charging based on actual usage of the vehicle. It does this by way of a small wireless device called the Metromile Pulse, which plugs into the diagnostic port of the insured’s vehicle to count the number of miles driven. Drivers are then billed a base rate and a per-mile rate. The company claims that its typical, low-mileage customer can save, on average, $500 per year on insurance.
Preston adds that Metromile’s second differentiator is down to “urbanization and a shifting mindset of millennials.” By this, he means that the less frequent and less regular use of cars by these groups makes per-mile services — which would otherwise work out to be very expensive for more habitual drivers — more appealing.
The third factor that drives users to Metromile is the company’s app. Similar to how many other startups have disrupted their incumbent predecessors, Metromile provides a mobile experience that lets users see and track just how much they are using the insurance and how much they will need to pay. It also has other features like vehicle location, travel data and more.
The changing landscape for transportation will potentially present new opportunities for Metromile in the future.
One area is in connected cars, where you could imagine Metromile being integrated as a built-in option by the automakers: “We have not yet announced any integrations with connected car companies, but are extremely excited about the opportunity,” he told me when I asked about potential partnerships.
Similarly, autonomous and shared-ownership cars — areas that companies like GM, with its Maven initiative, are investing a lot of effort these days — are also targets.
“With multiple types of mixed-use vehicles and autonomous cars, the nature of insurance risk modeling is going to change and insurance companies should aim to adapt to it,” Preston said. “From a consumer perspective, car ownership will continue to be important for people in the US for many years. That said, commuting miles will change because of better public transportation infrastructure and more transportation options which is why pay-per-mile insurance is an important option.”
As we’ve seen in other industries, while Metromile may potentially cut into the business of large insurance companies, it’s also attracting these same competitors as strategic investors, who invest as a hedge against their own existing business.
“Metromile is a proven leader in usage-based insurance technology,” said CPIC in a statement. “Our relationship with Metromile gives us the opportunity to more closely understand the pay-as-you-drive model, allowing us to create more innovative products and a better service experience for the younger and digitalized generation of the future.”
“Our goal, in partnering with Metromile, was to build a relationship that would allow both organizations to strengthen their core competencies in order to enhance the customer experience,” said Karim Hirji, Senior Vice-President, International & Ventures, Intact Financial Corporation, in a statement. “We look forward to this ongoing collaboration as Metromile redefines the marketplace with its unique business model, innovations and smart technology offerings.”

Probably the first time I saw Clive Owen, it was in a “film” commissioned by BMW to advertise its cars. At the time, I didn’t really care all that much about cars (I had one, and it was fine, and that was all I needed to know about that) but these short movies still had a considerable impact on me, mostly because they were so well-made.
The original series starred Owen as the The Driver, an otherwise unnamed protagonist with a flare for fine wheel work. They also starred BMW cars, which were very capable co-stars when paired with Owen’s keen ability to whip vehicles around in ways that frustrate opponents and get hard jobs done with a maximum of cool. The originals also featured a steady stream of star directors and on-screen talent, including then-power couple Madonna and Guy Ritchie.
Owen’s stoic Driver makes a return these many years later, having aged better than myself, and he’s going on adventures with a new cast that includes standouts like Jon Bernthal (The Punisher from Netflix’s Daredevil), Dakota Fanning and Vera Farmiga. The Escape is directed by Neill Blomkamp of District 9 fame, which means it’ll probably be better than most of the things you’d pay $10 or more to go see in theaters today.
The Escape’s inaugural episode (assuming there are more than one) will debut on October 23, which is just over a month away. If you didn’t catch the original and are wondering what all the fuss is about, or you just want to relive the magic, check out this full playlist of The Hire on YouTube.

884,Tesla patches exploit that left Model S potentially vulnerable to remote access,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/20/tesla-patches-exploit-that-left-model-s-potentially-vulnerable-to-remote-access/,2016/09/20,"
Tesla moved quickly to patch a vulnerability discovered by Tencent security research team Keen Security Lab that rendered the Model S susceptible to remote attacks, provided the Tesla Model S was currently making use of its in-car web browser, and also physically close to and connected with a maliciously modified Wi-Fi hotspot.
Keen’s security team had been focusing on Tesla vehicles over the course of several months, and were able to combine a number of security vulnerabilities in order to achieve the exploit they demonstrated, which allowed them to remotely gain control of the vehicle to trigger things including the turn signal, the sun roof, the seat position and unlock the doors while the vehicle is parked.
When in motion, the exploit allowed the researchers to control the vehicle’s wiper blades, fold in the driver- and passenger-side rearview mirrors, open the trunk, and even bring the vehicle to a stop.

Keen Security Lab reported the vulnerabilities to the Tesla security team prior to discussing it publicly, and Tesla moved quickly to patch the exploit vector, issuing an over-the-air software update that’s available now to Model S owners within two weeks of receiving Keen’s report. Here’s the statement Tesla provided on the issue and the fix:

Within just 10 days of receiving this report, Tesla has already deployed an over-the-air software update (v7.1, 2.36.31) that addresses the potential security issues. The issue demonstrated is only triggered when the web browser is used, and also required the car to be physically near to and connected to a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot. Our realistic estimate is that the risk to our customers was very low, but this did not stop us from responding quickly.
We engage with the security research community to test the security of our products so that we can fix potential vulnerabilities before they result in issues for our customers. We commend the research team behind today’s demonstration and plan to reward them under our bug bounty program, which was set up to encourage this type of research.

Model S owners can, and are encouraged to update their vehicle firmware as soon as possible, but as noted in the release, if it’s going to be a while before you can properly install the update, in the meantime as long as you avoid connecting to any suspicious open Wi-Fi networks and/or avoid using your browser, you won’t be at risk.

The U.S. Federal Government noted yesterday that it would be releasing an autonomous vehicle policy designed to help guide the safe development of driverless tech, while also allowing flexibility so that companies can continue to innovate in this space. The full policy is now available, and viewable in full either via the embed below, or at the Transportation.gov official website.
Both the DOT and President Barack Obama prefaced the release of this document with comments yesterday that indicated the general tone and intent of the full guidelines, which include recommendations designed to help guide the interpretation of current laws related to roads and driving in the context of autonomous cars, and to help with the formulation of new regulations. They also include 15-point checklist that the government is asking anyone making driverless vehicles to fill out as a way to help regulators ensure due process around safety is being followed by all involved.

U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony R. Foxx says that the document, which spans 100 or so pages (plus footnotes), was created in consultation with industry stakeholders, subject matter experts, safety groups and more.
So far, industry reaction seems to be positive toward the new guidelines, with support coming from automakers, security providers and others working on the private side of the equation, but further study will be required before we can assess the true impact the new federal policy will have on the progress of the industry overall.

The Chinese market for electric vehicles is hot, and the latest indicator is a $1.08 billion raise from China’s LeEco, a Beijing-based web video company (which now dabbles in everything from televisions to transportation) that’s targeting Tesla with its own electric car plans. Funding for its first car is coming from Legend Holdings Corp., Yingda Capital Management Co. and China Minsheng Trust, according to the company.
LeEco’s big raise should help it accelerate its EV plans, which so far include the LeSEE, a concept sedan design intended to be completely autonomous. LeEco also has a partnership in place with U.S.-based Faraday Future.

887,Spiri’s prototype 200-mile EV is made for on-demand carpooling,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/20/spiris-prototype-200-mile-ev-is-made-for-on-demand-carpooling/,2016/09/20,"
Danish startup Spiri revealed their on-demand carpooling service in late August, and is now ready to show off its first prototype vehicle. The company decided to build its own all-electric car from the ground up, using an engineering team with talent from Aston Martin, Tesla and more, in order to arrive at a final product that best suits the needs of frequent, multi-passenger urban navigation.
Spiri stresses that this is still very much a prototype, with ex-Tesla VP and Spiri board member Peter Carlsson calling it “basically a lab on wheels” in a press release accompanying the unveiling. The idea is to tweak features including handling, interior cabin space, range and safety options through testing before deciding on what the final Spiri vehicle will look like once it hits roads in active use.

The current Spirit car design only weighs around 992 lbs., which is way less than the Tesla Model S starting at 4,597 lbs., or even the BMW i3 at 2,635 lbs. The startup achieved that weight by basically throwing out everything on a standard car that “add[s] zero value to a person’s daily commute and travel,” according to Spiri CEO Stefan Holm Nielsen in a statement. That means there aren’t any interior body panels, and around one-quarter of the total parts used in making a regular consumer car. There isn’t even any paint. Plus, the vehicle’s body is entirely made out of carbon fibre, a light but strong material commonly used by EV makers to shave off valuable ounces in service of efficiency.

Spiri does have a bit more tech on-board than your average car, however, since it’s constantly connected to the cloud in order to ensure the cars are monitored throughout their use for safety. Passengers are also registered via the Spiri app and matched with others using the startup’s algorithms to maximize the effectiveness and speed of its carpooling routes.
Spiri’s ultra-light EV will help it optimize service pricing to achieve user fees the company says will be similar to the cost of a bus ticket, along with its plan to use customers as drivers of the vehicles, giving them free access to the cars in exchange for their service. Eventually, Spiri says it’s eyeing vehicle automation as a way to eliminate the need for even that portion of its business model, but for now the company’s biggest hurdle remains getting quality, responsible and safe drivers behind the wheel while also relying on unpaid members of its general user group.
The startup aims to begin its service sometime in 2017 in a city in one of five launch countries, which include the UK, Germany, Denmark, Norway and Sweden.

888,"Chevrolet Bolt EV starts at $29,995 U.S. with federal tax credits",https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/19/chevrolet-bolt-ev-starts-at-29995-u-s-with-federal-tax-credits/,2016/09/19,"
Chevrolet’s new Bolt EV is a vehicle that Wired has dubbed “Tesla-walloping,” and its pricing seems like a direct shot at Tesla’s lineup, including the forthcoming Model 3, which is set to be the dedicated electric carmaker’s more “affordable” option. Chevrolet revealed specific pricing and trim details for the base model Bolt EV LT, which begins at $37,495 US and which drops to $29,995 with the maximum $7,500 federal government tax credit applied – just squeaking under the stated $30K post-credit ceiling Chevy has been touting for a while now.
The official price details are more or less just Chevrolet filling in the remaining digits for a $29,XXX.XX price-after-incentives we’d all generally come to expect, then, but we also now know what you get standard in that Bolt EV trim level in addition to an EPA-rated 238 mile range on a single charge (the Model 3’s base model range is currently set at 215 miles).
It also has a “Regen on Demand” steering wheel paddle, which is Chevy’s trademark tech for letting the driver slow the vehicle, and regenerate some battery power via friction at varying rates controllable right from the wheel. The regen paddle helps drivers looking to perfect a single pedal driving technique, which is possible in EVs like the Bolt where regenerative braking triggers as soon as you let your foot off the accelerator.

Other standard features on the Bolt EV’s LT trim include a rear-vision camera, a large 10.2-inch touchscreen for infotainment control and Michelin self-sealing tires to counter minor perforations. On the top trim package, dubbed the Bolt EV Premier (that does sound fancier), you get everything that’s in the LT plus leather, front and rear in-seat heating, a surround camera and an in-set backup camera display in the rearview mirror. The Bolt with Premier trim has an MSRP of $40,905.
On paper, both the Model 3 and the Bolt EV have advantages over the other – the Model 3 will be priced at $35,000 to start pre-incentives, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said, which represents a savings of $2,500 when compared to the Chevrolet. The Tesla will also have supercharger capabilities, which will mean faster fill-ups on the road. Tesla’s car will also manage 0-60 in six seconds or less, while the Bolt will do the same in under 6.5. Bolt has better range, however, and will probably have more interior space thanks to its hatchback design.
There’s one more thing about the Bolt that’s undeniably better than what the Model 3 can offer: it’s shipping date. Bolt EV goes on sale in “late 2016,” Chevrolet says, while the Model 3’s timeline has the first units going out in late 2017, with full production really only starting off in 2018.

889,U.S. federal guidelines for self-driving cars say they will lead to safer roads,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/19/u-s-federal-guidelines-for-self-driving-cars-say-they-will-lead-to-safer-roads/,2016/09/19,"
The U.S. government revealed its much-anticipated Federal Automated Vehicles policy on Monday evening, detailing its 15-point Safety Assessment to be rolled out fully on Tuesday, which is designed to give manufacturers hoping to build and ship self-driving vehicles proper expectations around what will work for regulators in terms of meeting safety requirements.
The Obama administration’s primary goal in setting out these guidelines is outlining policies that will encourage safe operation of autonomous vehicles, as well as guidance about including proper safety measures in their design; but it’s also designed to be flexible, giving companies and researchers working on self-driving tech the room they need to try different approaches and evolve their systems as needed.
What might be most interesting about the U.S. Department of Transportation’s overview document outlining its policy choices are that they begin by unequivocally expressing the view that the DOT believes “that automated vehicles hold enormous potential benefits for safety, mobility and sustainability.”
Picking up on that thread, President Barack Obama wrote an op-ed published in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that includes the following passage:
Right now, too many people die on our roads – 35,200 last year alone – with 94 percent of those the result of human error or choice. Automated vehicles have the potential to save tens of thousands of lives each year. And right now, for too many senior citizens and Americans with disabilities, driving isn’t an option. Automated vehicles could change their lives.
Obama goes on to talk about not only safety and accessibility benefits, but also corrections to urban congestion and pollution as benefits that can come out of self-driving tech, but he adds that getting there must be handled safely and responsibility, and with transparency between the companies creating the technology and American citizens.
The President also notes that Government can often over-regulate when the pace of technology moves too quickly, and this policy is derived to avoid that and provide room for growth and innovation.
The 15-point Safety Assessment that the DOT is asking automated carmakers to opt into when devaluing their systems includes a request to document how, where, and when the car should operate, what happens when it fails, how its object detection system works, what its testing process includes and data captured by its onboard crash sensors, cybersecurity measures included in the system and more.
Already, private industry players are responding to the new guidelines, and much of the response seems to suggest Obama’s administration hit the right balance in crafting the new policy. Lyft’s Joe Okpaku, VP of Government Relations, provided this statement to TechCrunch, for instance:
Very soon, autonomous vehicles will improve the way we live and travel.  As regulators begin to focus on this exciting technology, Lyft believes that safety must be of paramount importance. Flexibility and innovation must also be preserved as this entirely new form of transportation comes to market. Much work remains ahead, but NHTSA’s guidelines are a step in the right direction.
The new policy also includes a model pointy that the DOT is hoping will help individual states craft legislation that’s more harmonious and consistent with its own national framework, and regulatory tools that can help interpret existing laws of the road in light of automated vehicle use, as well guide the creation of new regulation and statutes in service of safely deploying self-driving tech.
To discuss with private sector stakeholders how the policy will impact their work, the Obama administration is hosting a White House Frontiers Conference on October 13.

890,Elio Motors locks in price for nonrefundable reservations,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/19/elio-motors-locks-in-price-for-nonrefundable-reservations/,2016/09/19,"
Elio Motors has raised funds for manufacturing its forthcoming three-wheeled commuter vehicle in a few innovative ways, including Regulation A+ stock offerings. Its latest creative funding is through its reservation system. Anyone who puts down money for an “All In” nonrefundable reservation for an Elio has the base price of their vehicle locked in at $7,300.
The wording is a bit tricky, so follow along: The locked-in price is for nonrefundable reservations made after August 12 and will apply until there are 65,000 total reservations made — refundable and nonrefundable alike. There are currently more than 58,000 reservations for the three wheeler on the books, so there are fewer than 7,000 to go until that target is hit.
Also, anyone who chooses the nonrefundable reservation will get an additional 25% of their reservation amount applied to the purchase of their Elio. So if you reserve an Elio for $1000, you’ll get another $250 applied at the point of sale.
Elio Motors is hoping this reservation target number of 65,000 will help with its Department of Energy Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) loan application. This program assists manufacturers of vehicles that meet “specified fuel economy requirements,” which is likely not the Elio’s sticking point. It is expected to get 84 mpg.
Since last year, Elio Motors has raised $17 million via Regulation A+ stocks and $20 million from crowdfunding and these place-in-line reservations. It has also made plans to manufacture the aerodynamic vehicles — which are officially classified as motorcycles but have power windows, cruise control, and a/c — in Shreveport, Louisiana.

891,Uber will open a new facility in Detroit,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/19/uber-will-open-a-new-facility-in-detroit/,2016/09/19,"
Uber VP Sherif Marakby told attendees at the SAE Convergence conference in Novi, Michigan today that it will open a new facility in the metro Detroit area in the “coming months,” in order to better partner with car companies and tier-1 suppliers, according to The Detroit News.
Marakby is actually an ex-Ford employee, having worked for the company for 25 years prior to joining Uber, and worked primarily out of Ford’s Dearborn HQ, so he knows the area well. Marakby has been stationed out of Uber’s Pittsburgh research facility (where its self-driving test is taking place) since joining Uber as VP of Global Vehicle Programs earlier this year.
Details abut what the Uber Detroit facility will do, how many employees it’ll host or the specific location of the office aren’t available because Uber is still finalizing the lease details for the facility. Marakby also stressed that “Uber is not in the business of making cars,” according to the Detroit News, emphasizing that its focus with the new facility is to be closer to potential and existing partners.

Over the next 10 years, the differentiating source of supply and value in the automotive industry will not be car parts or engines. Instead, it will be a network of software developers.
The autonomous car will be here before we know it. Tesla autonomous technology has already amassed 100 million-plus miles. Legacy car manufacturer General Motors joined the action by acquiring self-driving startup Cruise. Apple has plans to release its own car by 2019, while Uber is planning to launch autonomous rides in Pittsburgh.
When autonomous vehicles become available at scale, the car will transform from just a mode of transportation into a new-age entertainment hub, with captive consumers surrounded by its technology for an average of at least five hours a week.
The automotive industry has been building cars for more than 100 years. The next 100 years will look radically different. Consumers will care less about the physical performance of the car and more about the software and experience of the car. Ring a bell?
Enter the development platform for autonomous cars. This will be the smartphone wars 2.0. The market opportunity is at least as big, if not far bigger.
As we saw with the introduction of the iPhone and Google’s Android, existing dominant players BlackBerry and Nokia were laid to waste. Steven Elop, the CEO of Nokia at the time, had a famous quote, which I referenced in my book Modern Monopolies: “The battle of devices has now become a war of ecosystems.” So too with cars.
Who will own the next 50 years of the automotive industry?
Around the time the iPhone was first introduced, Nokia owned 50 percent of the smartphone market, RIM 8.3 percent and Motorola 6.6 percent. Why did none of them build a development platform to draw in millions of software developers to build apps on top of their phones and operating system? That’s the billion-dollar question.
Let’s hope automobile manufacturers realize the tremendous threat and opportunity in front of them. Which one will step up and be the automobile version of the iPhone? In platforms, there’s typically room for only one or two dominant players. Who will own the next 50 years of the automotive industry?
The next five years will determine the next 50 years of the automobile industry
While bringing autonomous cars to consumers is an important task today, ultimately it will be table stakes, as any smart exec should expect that every new car will have autonomous capabilities to drive itself within the next five to 10 years. We’re already seeing this on a small scale with features like automatic accident-prevention breaking. Once consumers become familiar with the benefits (and relative safety) of autonomous cars, there will be no going back.
Automobile manufacturers must embrace business model innovation.
The more exciting challenge is not in manufacturing an autonomous car, but rather in building a platform that connects software developers with consumers and passengers in these vehicles of the future. Automobile manufacturers must embrace business model innovation and diversify to become a platform companies, lest they face the same fate as Nokia and BlackBerry before them.
Unfortunately, for the auto manufacturers, there will only be two winners. No one wants to be Windows Phone — but inevitably, more than a few of today’s major players will be. The auto companies that are first to successfully launch a development platform for autonomous cars will have a distinct advantage.
Difficulties for traditional enterprises to embrace platform innovation
Traditional enterprises usually innovate in increments. If they were to embrace true disruption, they would embrace business model innovation. Platform business models are fundamentally different than existing linear models that drive today’s auto manufacturers.
Platform businesses take many years to reach a point of critical mass, and have a great deal of risk and expense associated with making them successful. However, if they are successful, platforms enjoy winner-take-all dynamics and strong network effects that create a key defensive moat to keep competitors out.
A lot of C-suite executives have their hands tied by external shareholders expecting quarterly performance. Building a platform business is like starting a new company, and it takes a long time for it to reach a point of maturity that satisfies investor expectations.
Amazon is a great example of a platform company that has been able to manage investor expectations to tolerate many years of losses with the hope that Amazon’s strong network effects will eventually result in market dominance and shareholder earnings.

Automotive companies should take a page out of Amazon’s playbook and position themselves for the next 10 years of investment. Though they may not see it yet, this move is necessary for their survival. But it also offers enormous upside: the chance to win the platform wars that are bound to revolutionize and challenge traditional approaches in the industry.
Somewhat ironically, former BlackBerry co-CEO Jim Balsillie once said that this transition from linear to platform business is “where tech companies go to die.” Unfortunately for him, in the case of BlackBerry, he was right. Apple and Google have shown that this need not be the case. But time is of the essence. Executives and shareholders should be clamoring for today’s automotive companies to embark on their platform journey as early as possible, lest they miss chance to win the battle for the future of the automobile.
The future of cars is very clear. Now we’ll see who gets there first. Game on.

894,20-minute hot take: 2017 Volvo S90 Pilot Assist,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/15/20-minute-hot-take-2017-volvo-s90-pilot-assist/,2016/09/15,"
I’ve spent the last couple of days at a Northwest Automotive Press Association driving event, and the last car of the two dozen or so I drove was the 2017 Volvo S90 with the latest version of IntelliSafe, which includes City Safety, Pilot Assist, and more. I’ve already put my name on the list for a more extensive test drive, but even with less than 30 minutes of drive time, I noticed differences.
In the spring, I had a Volvo XC90 SUV with the last version of this “semi autonomous drive system” — Volvo’s words, not mine — and I found it worked well then. The version in the S90 sedan is new and indeed improved. The lane keeping assist felt more assured, and the Pilot Assist technology worked up to 80 mph.
I had a stretch of highway headed toward Portland, Oregon, to navigate in the early afternoon. I didn’t get anywhere near 80 mph, but that was fine for a quick test of the new system. There were open stretches where the car could get up to the speed limit of 55 mph, where I’d set the automatic cruise control. There were also congested stretches with cars speeding up and slowing way down across four lanes of traffic.
Pilot Assist worked seamlessly in these conditions to read traffic and slow down when appropriate then speed up again when traffic got moving. It did a particularly good job when vehicles were merging onto the highway and I was in the right lane to take the next exit.
But one of the most noticeable changes was that Pilot Assist no longer needs a lead car to lock onto. Even on those less congested stretches of road, Pilot Assist kept me at a constant speed and in my lane with minimum input from me, though I did need to monitor the situation in case anyone around me tried anything weird.
When I needed to take that exit or merge into traffic myself, Pilot Assist took a break and the indicators went dark to let me know I was in charge. I would take over for the tricky parts of driving, and when things were easy and repetitive again, I reset the system and let it do most of the work.
I kept my eyes on the road and my hands lightly on the wheel. If you take your hands completely off the wheel, Pilot Assist turns off. This is a step in the direction of semi autonomous vehicles, not a self-driving vehicle. Yet.
There are other safety features I wasn’t able to test on an urban highway, like the S90’s ability to detect pedestrians and bicyclists with City Safety, as well as Large Animal Detection when outside the city. I was also alone in the car, so I wasn’t able to get pictures of the Pilot Assist features in the console display while they were active.

895,"Vinli tops the car apps market, adds Meineke and Cox for distribution",https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/14/vinli-tops-the-car-apps-market-adds-meineke-and-cox-for-distribution/,2016/09/14,"
Connected car startup Vinli has accumulated a lot of traction since it started shipping 10 months ago, following a launch at TechCrunch Disrupt in 2014. The company began by offering a hardware dongle for vehicle diagnostic OBD-II ports, but has since expanded to focus on its software platform, which makes it possible or app makers to target their products to connected vehicles. Now, it’s making access even easier through new distribution arrangements.
Vinli definitely isn’t the only company that offers a connected car platform using hardware that connects to a vehicle’s diagnostic port, but it can now claim to offer the largest selection of apps tailored for any connected car product, the company says. There are 47 apps in total available for Vinli, with “hundreds” in various stages of development ahead of release, according to Vinli founder and CEO Mark Haidar.
“We want to be the connected car platform for any car on the road, that’s our objective,” Haidar said. “So we started focusing on the cloud aspect of the car, and not the hardware aspect or the head unit aspects of the vehicle. We believe that the cloud plays an important role whether you have an autonomous car, a regular car or an old car on the road; the cloud can serve all these environments.”
To get around the fact that nearly 99 percent of cars were not able to connect into the kinds of cloud services that Vinli wanted to provide, it created its own hardware, but ultimately that was just a vector: Haidar says they’re eager to offer their platform however they can, including with its Carport product created in partnership with automaker supplier Continental to have its services built directly into vehicles by OEMs. Haidar says talks continue with other direct-to-OEM solutions to put Vinli in vehicles before they ever even get to consumers.
Vinli’s Carport dashboard
Now, Vinli is also stepping up its distribution efforts in the second-hand vehicle market, with new partnerships announced today between the startup and Meineke, and with Cox Automotive. The Meineke arrangement will see Vinli become an part of the service package provided to Meineke reward members in service locations beginning in October. Haidar explains that this will also bring Meineke services to customers via Vinli, including push notifications alerting users when their car is due for service.
With the Cox Automotive tie-up, Vinli will actually ship with vehicles sold via dealerships belonging to the car industry giant, as an option package that includes cellular connectivity via T-Mobile, which Haidar says should help their platform get into a lot more cars in the near future. Cox is actually involved in some way or another in “three out of four vehicle transactions in some way,” according to a recent interview from Automotive News, with 40,000 dealerships through its network across the U.S.
“Imagine with just these two channels, this could get Vinli into millions of cars, because you can scale much faster,” Haidar told me about the potential impact to Vinli’s business stemming from the new partnerships.
Expanding distribution channels is huge for a service like Vinli’s because the vast majority of customers just aren’t likely to head out and purchase aftermarket add-ons for their vehicles like and OBD-II dongle that would generally be necessary to make access to apps possible.

896,Cruise founder Kyle Vogt on why he joined forces with GM,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/14/cruise-founder-kyle-vogt-on-why-he-joined-forces-with-gm/,2016/09/14,"
General Motors snapped up Silicon Valley-based Cruise Automation for more than $1 billion earlier this year with plans to plant its self-driving tech inside its own car brands.
It was a fine move for GM, which has been aligning itself with several automotive ventures over the past year — including a partnership with Lyft, acquiring assets from the now defunct rideshare competitor Sidecar and launching its own rideshare service Maven.
Cruise founder Kyle Vogt came onstage today at TechCrunch Disrupt to chat about the GM deal and his plans to become a key player in the automated driving space under the major car manufacturer.
“Ultimately what we want to achieve with self-driving cars is to deploy it at scale,” Vogt said. “You can’t do that by retrofitting cars one by one.”
GM and its many partnerships will help Cruise get there faster and cheaper, according to Vogt, who was careful to mention GM’s partnership with Lyft was key in getting the customers and infrastructure needed to get there.
But Vogt also doesn’t think we won’t truly see the benefit in automated driving until we remove humans altogether. “Humans are inherently erratic,” he said. “You don’t unlock the true potential until it’s truly self-driving, get the humans off the road.”
Cruise launched three years ago when driving sans-human seemed like something that would happen 20 years down the road. We’re not there yet, but truly self-driving cars are now much closer than we think, according to Vogt.
He’s particularly confident about his position in the space with the new resources from a bigger, more established company. Cruise is now working with Maven and Lyft and can place its technology within the 7 to 8 million connected vehicles in Chevy’s OnStar program, thanks to the GM deal.
GM is not the only vehicle manufacturer planting its flag in this technology. Ford, Audi, Toyota and pretty much every major U.S. vehicle maker seems to be making moves here. And a big hurdle now is finding the talent to help build these driving systems.
“But it’s a question of going with a company where your work will see the light of day,” Vogt pointed out.

He also agreed the nanodegree Udacity announced yesterday at Disrupt that was created to help certify more engineers in building automated vehicles would be a good start, but they’ll need “a little more than that,” he said. “…like a background in computer engineering.”
But, as Vogt pointed out, GM has made some key moves that will help position them at the forefront of the autonomous driving market — adding that a big part of the self-driving future is in ridesharing.
Lyft, Uber and others stand to gain from an aging population of drivers who may not be able to continue driving themselves but still need to get around. Vogt says he is focused on safety and making transportation more accessible to these senior members and mentioned Lyft was going to play into those plans.
Vogt doesn’t think that means America’s love affair with car ownership is going away anytime soon. “They’ll co-exist for a while,” he said.
But will we see our first self-driving cars through Lyft? “We’ll have to wait and see,” Vogt said.

Cruise’s Kyle Vogt was on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2016, and the CEO of the self-driving car startup that GM acquired earlier this year shared some updates about the company’s progress under its new owner. Vogt said that access to GM’s considerable resources has helped it accelerate its efforts.
GM previously revealed that it was testing cars on roads in San Francisco and in Arizona, but Vogt said that there are now around 30 self-driving test cars in operation across both markets. This marks the first time Cruise has given any indication about the size of its fleet.

Besides the test vehicles, which are Chevy Bolts equipped with the necessary sensor array and on-board processing, and manned by a safety crew, Vogt noted that over 8 million vehicles with on-board cameras through GM’s OnStar service are in operation, which provides a considerable competitive advantage in terms of building a usable data set to help informal Cruise’s self-driving car smarts.
Vogt also said that the team has grown from around 40 to over 100 employees since the acquisition, and that they’re looking to keep growing quickly.

898,Velodyne adds a high-res version of its LiDAR sensor for autonomous driving,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/14/velodyne-adds-a-high-res-version-of-its-lidar-sensor-for-autonomous-driving/,2016/09/14,"
The autonomous driving company on which both Ford and Baidu are betting $150 million has a new version of its LiDAR sensor. The new Puck Hi-Res has a name that reflects both its shape and what distinguishes it form the original puck – higher resolution LiDAR imaging that helps it offer up the “most detailed 3D views possible from LiDAR,” according to the company.
Velodyne notes that the new version of the Puck was actually well into its development cycle before the new $150 million investment from Baidu/Ford. Still, that money will help Velodyne accelerate the pace at which it can achieve mass production of the new sensor, the company says, bringing it to market faster and cheaper than would’ve been possible otherwise.
While Velodyne has emerged as a leader in the LiDAR space, after beginning life as a high fidelity stereo equipment maker, the use of LiDAR itself in self-driving systems isn’t universally seen as necessary. At Disrupt SF earlier this week, Udacity founder Sebastian Thrun, who also started Google’s self-driving car project, said he believes a fully photographic sensor system should be able to handle autonomous driving without LiDAR. Tesla’s Elon Musk also announced a Version 8.0 update for Autopilot this past weekend, and he likewise eschewed LiDAR, using radar as the cornerstone of the system instead.
Still, as costs decrease and investment goes into refining the LiDAR manufacturing process, it’s hard to see any reason why future autonomous driving systems might not include LiDAR alongside radar and photographic sensors, too, just to produce the most comprehensive possible picture of driving conditions to onboard image processing hardware.

Uber is now dispatching self-driving cars to a select group of users in Pittsburgh and invited us along for the ride.
I hailed a car from Uber’s Advanced Technologies Campus Tuesday and took a 45-minute ride through the city’s downtown, eastern and northern neighborhoods. I watched as the wheel turned itself, carefully maneuvering us through crowded streets and around other cars and pedestrians. 
The two engineers manning the front seats let me “drive” the car back to the Uber campus. Once a light turned blue on the dash, I could hit a silver button in the center console to go autonomous. Braking, accelerating or hitting a red button brought driving back under my control. I took over once to maneuver around a stopped van.Later, we sat in traffic on yet another bridge. The car started and stopped as we crawled forward a few feet at a time. Sometimes it was gentle, sometimes it came to a lurching halt. It felt a lot like riding in a car with a human driver, right down to the Uber map telling us we had reached our destination.

Nvidia revealed a new configuration of its DRIVE PX 2 in-car autonomous driving computing platform today, which vastly improves power efficiency and drops physical size compared to the original unveiled at CES earlier this year. The new single-core configuration will be used by Baidu in its own self-driving cars, as part of the previously announced partnership between the two companies to create a complete, “cloud-to-car” autonomous driving system.
The PX 2 AI computer is the second generation of DRIVE PX, and one that Nvidia says is in use among a number of OEMs, research institutions and other partners. It makes it possible to process visual and sensor data from self-driving car-mounted monitoring systems in real-time on board a vehicle, which is crucial for autonomy because it has to be able to act without a connection to a powerful remote server.
Depending on the needs of car makers and researchers, PX 2 can scale from this single-core, palm-sized form factor to multi-core, multi-GPU builds, and even to multiple DRIVE PX 2s working in concert in a single car. A single PX 2 can provide AutoCruise and HD mapping features using input from on-vehicle cameras and sensors.
The new system-on-a-chip should help considerably with expanding the potential appeal of PX 2 among clients, since its reduced size and power footprint will both be appealing to electric vehicle makers looking to minimize added wait and power requirements. Part of building high-efficiency, zero emission cars is paring down vehicle weight and power draw wherever possible – even relatively insignificant individual savings in various components can add up to an aggregate effect that has a measurable impact on range.

902,Comma.ai will ship a $999 autonomous driving add-on by the end of this year,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/13/comma-ai-will-ship-a-999-autonomous-driving-add-on-by-the-end-of-this-year/,2016/09/13,"
At TechCrunch Disrupt SF this year, famed iPhone and PlayStation hacker George Hotz unveiled the first official product of his automotive AI startup, Comma.ai. The Comma One is a $999 add-on shipping before the end of the year, with a $24 monthly subscription for its software, which Hotz says will be able to drive your car from Mountain View to San Francisco without requiring a driver to touch the wheel, the brake or the gas.
This isn’t a kit that makes your car into a fully self-driving vehicle, Hotz is quick to note, but it is a system that can provide powers equivalent to Tesla’s Autopilot, without requiring that you buy a whole new car. “It’s Mountain View to San Francisco without touching the wheel,” Hotz said. At launch, Comma One will support a small group of specific vehicles, but over time the startup hopes to add compatibility with more models.
Hotz contends that Comma’s key ingredient is “shippability,” a key ingredient he says other companies lack. Automakers and other startups are fond of announcing self-driving car projects (another was announced earlier today, in fact), but Hotz points out that many of these companies don’t even have hardware, let alone products they can sell to consumers.
“It is fully functional. It’s about on par with Tesla Autopilot,” Hotz said. It doesn’t have a lot of sensors as the Comma One relies on built-in car front radars and comes with a camera. “The key sensors that we’re getting back is the cam. We’re actually getting back the video, even Tesla isn’t doing that.” Hotz said. “We have all the video data.

The exceptions almost start and end with Tesla, he notes. The company’s Autopilot system is in active use, and in fact just got an update this past weekend that should vastly improve its performance and decrease the possibility that the car doesn’t brake when it should. “If they are the iOS of self-driving cars, we want to be Android,” Hotz said.
Hotz also spent some time talking about Tesla’s fatal crash. “40,000 people die a year from not paying attention. It isn’t like it is a special case ‘a self-driving car killed him’, it was the case of a driver not paying attention,” Hotz said. “It did unfortunately happen with Tesla. And I think Tesla’s response was very appropriate.”
 

Hotz’s system stemmed from critiques of offerings used by many major automakers, like the ones from Mobileye, and the intent of the Comma One is to provide features that automate highway driving to an even greater extent than existing adaptive cruise control and lane assist tech. “If you’re looking to Mobileye to build the software of the future — don’t,” he said during the interview.
The $999 price point is designed to be affordable, and is possible because of the components Comma uses in its product, which tend to be inexpensive off-the-shelf electronics. “We’re going to try our best to ship it before the end of the year. Again, in very limited quantity,” Hotz said. More info about its release and availability will be revealed soon.

903,See Jane Go live today,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/13/see-jane-go-live-today/,2016/09/13,"
Ride hailing services aimed at women drivers and passengers are a small but growing niche. See Jane Go is officially up and running today; drivers and passengers can download the app on iOS or Android to get started. SafeHer will be launching in Boston this fall with plans to expand to four cities soon after.
In reporting on See Jane Go and SafeHer (the ride hailing service known briefly as Chariot for Women) earlier this year, I found that women are uncomfortable as both drivers and riders using the bigger ride hailing services like Uber and Lyft. The idea of picking up or riding with a random guy seems less than safe to a lot of women.
See Jane Go is addressing this issue by designing the service for women and those who identify as women. CEO Kimberly Toonen said in an earlier interview, “All drivers submit an application with their driver’s license, and we use that to validate gender. Whatever they’ve self-identified as there” is good enough. And men can use the service in the company of a woman who vouches for them.
Riders can mark drivers as favorites in the See Jane Go app, and vice versa. The service’s algorithm then pairs favorites together more often. This fosters more than mere friendliness; one of the company’s goals is to create a networking space for women as they use the service. “We’re trying to encourage a back-and-forth — sharing resources, networking, and advice,” said Toonen.
Though the service is only live in Orange County, California, today, it is encouraging women across the country to sign up. The press release announcing the launch noted the company’s “aggressive plans to expand nationwide,” and cities with lots of potential users will help shape those expansion plans.

904,Udacity plans to build its own open-source self-driving car,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/13/udacity-plans-to-build-its-own-open-source-self-driving-car/,2016/09/13,"
Sebastian Thrun’s online education startup Udacity recently created a self-driving car engineering nanodegree, and on stage at Disrupt today Thrun revealed that the company intends to build its own self-driving car as part of the program, and that it also intends to open source the technology that results, so that “anyone” can try to build their own self-driving vehicle, according to Thrun.
The crowdsourced vehicle plans will ultimately be created in service of the school, rather than a product in and of itself. The open-sourcing of the data should help other projects ramp up, and will include driving data and more to contribute to other people’s projects.
Thrun also said that the self-driving car program will begin testing quietly much like Google’s did, and that it will use trained safety drivers behind the wheels in case of issues.
Other companies are open-sourcing self-driving tech, including Comma.ai, which released a driving data set that it used to create its first functional self-driving vehicle add-on prototype, but it sounds like Thrun’s plan is to open-source the entire thing, since it isn’t the core focus of Udacity’s business.
Thrun also revealed a number of official partners for its autonomous driving nanodegree program, including Mercedes and more.

Sebastian Thrun is taking a drive down memory lane with the latest initiative from his online learning juggernaut, Udacity. The company is partnering with Mercedes-Benz Research & Development North America, Didi, Otto, and Nvidia on a nanodegree program for self-driving cars, Thrun announced onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt SF.
Working with Udacity, the partners will set up a curriculum that includes courses on sensor fusion, situation assessment, maneuver and trajectory planning and deep learning.
Applications open today and will be accepted through the 27th of September. According to a release from Mercedes-Benz each session is 12 weeks long for roughly a nine-month training session.
As part of students’ capstone project, they will build autonomous software that will be applied to an actual vehicle.
Consulting firm BCG believes the market for partially and fully autonomous vehicles will be at $22 billion by 2025. With numbers like those, Udacity believes that there aren’t going to be enough engineers to hire from the premiere institutions like Carnegie Mellon, Stanford and MIT.
The partners in the program concur. They’ve all agreed to fast track students from the nanodegree program for jobs after they graduate.
And each of the partners are chipping in with different aspects of the curriculum. Mercedes Benz is helping with software, Otto is going to help design projects for students to do, while Nvidia is going to guide the overall trajectory of the curriculum, according to a Udacity spokesperson.

Mercedes-Benz started its research in the valley in 1995  and in 2014 the company became one of the first car makers to be issued with a license by the state of California for testing self-driving vehicles on public roads.
Similarly, Didi and Udacity have a relationship that goes back years, the spokesperson for the online educator said. The company runs a machine-learning competition in China and as part of the agreement, Didi gets a sneak-peek at projects from the nanodegree students to see what may worth adopting in the company’s own fleet.
Ultimately, Thrun said Udacity wants to create its own self-driving car that could be on the streets of San Francisco later this year.
“We will be the only institution, I believe in the world, that would give a credential in this space,” Thrun said. “We decided at Udacity we wanted bleeding edge.”

906,ChargePoint creates Waitlist for public EV charging,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/12/chargepoint-creates-waitlist-for-public-ev-charging/,2016/09/12,"
It seems counterintuitive to call a service Waitlist. No one wants to be put on a wait list; we want to just do the thing we came to do. But ChargePoint has, ahem, a point in creating this new feature, which launches today. Basically, it allows drivers of electric vehicles to virtually queue up for a charging station.
Here’s the situation that Waitlist aims to solve. Say John, who has a long-ish commute, arrives at work and parks in the EV-designated space in the company parking garage. He plugs in and heads to his office. Then Jennifer arrives in her EV. She parks next to John but doesn’t know him or know that this is his car. She either has to keep checking on the charging car or leave a note asking the driver to call her when he’s done.
If that’s a ChargePoint charger, Jennifer can tap her ChargePoint card on the station itself to get in the queue. When his battery is topped off, John will get a “friendly reminder,” according to the press release, to move his EV and make room for the next person to charge.
Users can also set a time or energy limit — say, 80% full — for their charging session rather than waiting for the battery to be filled all the way. Those in line can either move their car to the now-vacant space when their turn comes up, or they can opt to defer if they’re busy. They’ll be added to the queue for the next available ChargePoint station.
In Waitlist’s testing phase, station usage increased by 20%. At stations that were already busy, with lots of cars moving in and out of designated EV spaces to charge, usage increased by 45%. The tests had 14,000 drivers participating, and on average 500 of them were queued up every day. Most importantly, “all drivers had typically received adequate charging before the end of the day.”
The email that accompanied the announcement noted that Waitlist can stop “charge rage,” the frustration that comes with waiting for an available charging station. This idea came across my desk about a year ago, and I made phone calls to charging companies and public parking garages with chargers in Portland, Oregon. No one at the time had heard of any actual users being mad enough to make a call or tweet or complain, so “charge rage” may not be anything to worry about.
Whether “charge rage” was real in 2015 may be a moot point in the future if features like Waitlist can stop that frustration in the in the first place.

907,This electric bus can handle a day’s worth of transit on one charge,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/12/this-electric-bus-can-handle-a-days-worth-of-transit-on-one-charge/,2016/09/12,"
Tesla topping the 300 mile per charge rating with its new 100 kWh battery was a big deal, but a new zero emission bus debuted today by Proterra has actually managed 600 miles out of a full battery in testing. In a real-world setting, Proterra’s new Catalyst E2 will probably manage somewhere between 194 and 350 miles in actual use settings – but that’s plenty according to the company, representing the full route needs for the average bus in the U.S.
That means that when the Catalyst E2 starts hitting city streets sometime in 2017, it’ll represent the first full-EV mass transit option that can actually stand in for existing gas-based vehicles without much in the way of compromise.
Proterra says in a press release that interest in its existing lineup is already on the rise, including a 220 percent rise in sales in 2016 vs 2015, and in order to meet the growing demand it’s going to double production starting in 2017. Part of that increased capacity will be focused on the new E2, which has a battery than can range between 440 and 660 kWH depending on configuration. That battery is actually the size of a mattress according to Wired, which is huge compared to the battery units found in Tesla and Chevy zero-emission cars.
All that extra capacity comes with a hefty price tag, too – around $800,000 just to start, which would potentially be a tough sell compared to a $300,000 or so price tag for a diesel-powered bus with the same passenger capacity. But that price is offset by subsidies in some cases, and there’s also the fact that it doesn’t have a maintenance-heavy internal combustion engine at the core of the powertrain, and it also doesn’t have fuel costs which will add to the savings over the lifetime of the bus on a rolling basis.
Proterra’s vehicles replace typical buses, making it more practical for short-term fleet replacement needs, but long-term, it’ll be interesting to see how these kinds of zero-emission solutions compete with things like smaller capacity shared commute services like Chariot, which Ford just acquired, and Tesla’s forthcoming plans to field fleets of multi-passenger electric vans as a transit alternative.

Toyota’s Prius Prime is an updated take on the company’s popular hybrid, with more emphasis on the EV aspects of the vehicle, including a battery with double the driving capacity, and a few other tweaks that push the car closer toward the EV end of its dual identity, including an acceleration feature that lets the electric motor handle much of the pick-up when you first put your foot down.
Toyota first gave us a glimpse at the Prime at the New York Auto Show this March, but now it’s giving the vehicle its west coast debut at Disrupt SF ahead of the office full reveal, which is coming soon.
The Prius Prime’s tech bona fides lie both within the cockpit, and in the changes made to the overall body design and external components in order to help maximize efficiency for a hybrid with more electric boogaloo.

Some of those changes include redesigned lines for the body panels, which vehicle comms manager Nathan Kokes said were created in order to maximize the energy efficiency of the vehicle as much as possible. That means, according to Kokes, paying attention to how changes to the exterior impact aerodynamics at a micro level.
In addition to the panels for the car’s sides, this led to changes to the front grill, and a rear window that actually dips in the middle slightly to help air flow over and under the car in a way that creates as little drag as possible, which in turn leans to better battery life.
Inside, there’s a new 11-inch capacitive touchscreen panel that’s set into the dash vertically. It’s a very Tesla-like move and one that Kokes tells me Toyota has found resonates well with the Prius’ target demographic. Customers who care about the tech powering their car via the drivetrain and power source also put a high value on the tech available via the infotainment system, too.
Toyota plans to reveal the full range of trim options, pricing and availability details for Prime soon, as mentioned, but for now it does look like a potentially good option for that group of customers Kokes says it’s focused on with the Prius, who are curious about EVs but still want to keep a foot planted firmly in the traditional gas-powered car realm.

BMW plans to accelerate its electric vehicle plans, in the wake of an executive shake-up and leading into a vote planned for the end of this month. The new BMW expanded electric lineup will kindle fully battery-powered versions of the Mini, the BMW 3 Series and the X4 SUV.
The company has previously discussed plans to electrify the 3 Series and other vehicles, but German’s Handelsblatt reports now that it’s picking up the pace on its EV strategy, in a bid to better compete with the likes of Tesla, whose Model 3 sedan has already amassed 400,000 pre-orders.
BMW’s current all-electric lineup is focused on the i3, a city-commuter oriented car that has a much more limited range than Tesla’s vehicles, including the forthcoming Model 3.
As mentioned, the renewed emphasis on EVs follows changes at the executive level, including a new CFO, and the merger of its marketing and sales divisions for Mini and BMW into a single organization.

At a press conference in San Francisco today, Ford Motor Co. president and CEO Mark Fields announced that the company had both acquired a rideshare startup called Chariot and made a significant investment in expanding the region’s bike-share program.
Ford’s sponsorship will see the Bay Area’s supply of shareable bikes expand from 700 to 7,000 by 2018, with 1,350 bikes going to the East Bay, and hundreds of new bike-share stations established to distribute the bikes.
The locations of the bike stations are still being determined, but these will be in and around Berkeley, Oakland and San Jose, not just in San Francisco.
The bike-share program is managed by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the Bay Area, and operated by a startup called Motivate, which also operates popular bike-share programs around the country, with their largest market in New York.
Motivate president and CEO Jay Walder said his company saw 10 million bike-share trips taken in New York in 2015, and that bike share would become part of the fabric of cities, increasingly. He did not offer projections for San Francisco bike-share usage.
In terms of technology, the bikes, now branded as the Ford GoBike, are not much to behold. They’re manufactured by Motivate and assembled domestically by Detroit Bikes.
They don’t include racks for cargo, a helmet or systems that would allow them to be parked or picked up anywhere. They’re more the sturdy, traditional bike-share bike with an electronic tracking and locking system.
In addition to ramping up the local, shareable bike supply, Ford will begin to show bike stations and available bikes within its Ford Pass app, said Fields.
Ford’s Pass app aims to be a single place where users can find available transportation or mobility options nearby whenever they need them.
Politicians and advocates — including San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee, Berkeley Mayor Tom Bates and San Jose Mayor and MTC Commissioner Sam Liccardo — showed up to ballyhoo the bike-share expansion and promote the idea that mobility options and transportation should be provided by not just public agencies but large, private sector partners.

912,Ford Smart Mobility acquires Chariot to boost its smart city transit plans,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/09/ford-mobility-solutions-acquires-chariot/,2016/09/09,"
Ford Smart Mobility, the company founded by Ford Motor Company to help provide alternate means of transportation, just made its first acquisition: Chariot, the San Francisco-based commuter ride-sharing startup.
For Ford, the move will make Chariot the cornerstone of its shuttle and mobility programs in cities going forward. Ford sees the startup as the path forward for its fledgling mobility company, which was officially incorporated in March, and so far has generally stuck to more limited-scope tests of its offering, mostly in partnership with academic institutions.
Chariot was founded in 2014, and has actually used Ford vehicles since day one. That’s just a coincidence, the company tells me, but it still uses only 15-seater Ford Transit vans with a tell-tale Chariot paint job. For Chariot, what being part of Ford Smart Mobility is the ability to ramp up quickly and increase the pace of expansion.
“We’re going to be super aggressive in expanding to multiple markets over the next year,” said Chariot CEO and co-founder Ali Vahabzadeh in an interview with TechCrunch. “It became very clear very early on that Chariot would be able to leverage Ford’s expertise in logistics and vehicle and operations to take Chariot and make this a global service, beyond just the Bay area.”
Existing Chariot service will continue uninterrupted, according to the company, and even the look will remain the same. Chariot will also grow out to at least five more markets in the next 18 months, according to Ford and Chariot, and the next market will be revealed sometime in the next few weeks. Vahabzadeh told me that Ford can help with expansion not only in terms of funds and logistics expertise, but also through its relationships with governments in countries and cities around the world.
Chariot’s goal was to provide a transit situation that sits near public transit in terms of cost, but that provides faster and more convenient routes. The platform crowdsources the creation of routes, aggregating desired pick-up and destination data from user interaction with its app and determining routes once interest in a particular one reaches a tipping point. It currently has 28 routes in the Bay area, with 100 vans in operation.
“We had this vision of creating this perfect commute, which was fast, reliable affordable and safe for the people of San francisco and eventually beyond,” explained Vahabzadeh.
Ford isn’t the only company to invest in shared transportation solutions; GM has its own internally-founded startup Maven, as well as a partnership with Lyft, for instance. And the Chariot model actually would fit in very nicely with Ford’s self-driving car plans, which include aiming to put a network of multi-passenger vehicles on the road to provide on-demand transit alternatives.
“There’s a long road ahead, but it’s just another reason why hooking up with Ford Smart Mobility now make sense,” said Vahabzadeh, noting that the companies will indeed look at how automation might fit into Chariot’s future.
Chariot and Ford declined to comment on the financial terms of the deal.

913,SpotHero is ready for the future of autonomous parking,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/08/spothero-is-ready-for-the-future-of-autonomous-parking/,2016/09/08,"
SpotHero is not new to the on-demand parking game. It raised $2.5 million in 2012, and another $20 million in Series B funding in 2015. This for a service that allows drivers to prepay for a parking space in a garage via app before the car ever leaves the driveway.
“You can reserve a spot for three hours or three days,” said SpotHero co-founder and CEO Mark Lawrence, “and you can make the reservation for right this minute or in two weeks.” You just scan your phone when you enter the garage and scan it again when you leave. You know where you’re parking and how much you’re going to pay — no driving around and no surprises.
While this is all very convenient today, Lawrence has his sights set on the future of driving, or not driving, as the case may be. Right now, the human interfaces with the phone, which interfaces with the online garage. In the future, the car will take the place of the human to connect with SpotHero, which connects with the garage to reserve and pay for the space.
“It could be an algorithm that says, ‘I need this autonomous pod or car to be stored for x amount of time,’ and it will run some calculations,” Lawrence said in our phone interview. “The algorithm will check to see if it can park farther for cheaper, and take traffic into account.”
The challenge, today and tomorrow, is that the garages have to be online for this to work, whether it’s a human or a car that wants to connect. “Parking facilities have to be online or they’re invisible,” Lawrence said. “They’re not going to be able to capture the largest share unless they’re visible. Let’s get these facilities online and make them available for ecommerce.”
SpotHero has a sales and marketing team tasked with increasing parking companies’ awareness of this source of revenue. The team takes a rising tide lifts all boats approach: “We say, ‘Here are all the interfaces out there; it’s not just SpotHero,'” Lawrence said. The team has to educate the parking companies on the tools available and the scanning and redemption technology required for future-proofing their businesses. “Otherwise, how are they going to communicate with consumers right now and also with cars that drive themselves in the future?”
We dove into the futuristic idea of electric autonomous pods during our conversation, which Lawrence acknowledged is an “angelic view.” Electric cars are more efficient than gasoline, but much of the grid in the United States is still powered by coal, and “there need to be macro changes before EVs on a grand scale are possible,” he said. “But even when the energy issue is solved, parking isn’t going to go away. Cities don’t want empty vehicles just roaming around.”
He’s predicting those futuristic vehicles will need to park themselves when not in use, and SpotHero will be ready to make the connection.

China is looking at electric vehicles as a key way to lower emissions and improve the country’s general environmental sustainability, and Volkswagen is teaming up with China state-owned car maker Anhui Jianghuai (JAC) to help fill that need.
The two car companies signed a memorandum of understanding today, effectively paving the way for them to create a new joint venture to develop battery-powered EVs to serve the Chinese market. The new company’s activities would include R&D, manufacturing, sales and “mobility services” (which could include EV taxi fleet operation). The end goal is to create zero emission personal transportation options, but there’s no timeline currently for when those might start to make it to actual consumers.
Since this is just an MoU to explore the possibility of a more formal partnership, it makes sense that the two companies wouldn’t be discussing timelines. The new arrangement would also add a new Chinese manufacturing partner to Volkswagen’s existing roster, which includes SAIC and FAW.
Volkswagen could’ve partnered with one of its existing automaker affiliates in the country, but adding a new partner might help it accelerate the pace at which it can expand its EV offerings. The German company has said it wants to create over 30 pure EVs over the course of the next decade, and expanding its partners could help it get to that target.

Tesla may have a range of vehicle showrooms across North America, but those can’t cover everyone, and it’s even more difficult for the average potential Tesla buyer to get to the company’s primary design studio in Hawthorne, so the automaker’s new ‘Tesla Explores‘ initiative is aiming to bring a taste of the design studio to you.
The program is a road-trip across the continent, using six Airstream trailers outfitted as Tesla mobile Design Studios, each towed behind a Model X. The project has a number of announced locations for its initial stops, but the ultimate goal is to cover more broadly with new locations to be added based on customer input. Tesla is asking people interested in having one of the Design Studios visit to register their interest via a new website for the program.
Tesla continues to try to change laws in various states regarding direct selling, and its model remains illegal in a few states. These mobile showrooms might be a way to get around those restrictions, depending on what kind of sales process occurs in the portable showrooms themselves.

Land Rover’s new Discovery, which it teased yesterday via our first ever look at the SUV’s front end, also has a “world-first” smart seat feature, which lets owners reconfigure their vehicle seating from anywhere with a data connection with an app on their smartphone. Naturally, Land Rover decided to show us how this works by throwing Bear Grylls out of a plane with six professionals from the Royal Navy Parachute Display Team to show us how it works when you’re free-falling at a rate of 125mph.
It’s difficult to conceive of something that better fits the label “stunt marketing,” but it does still manage to illustrate the feature pretty well. The app lets you adjust the layout of the seats inside the car, turning it from a two-seater with plenty of cargo space, to a seven seater with two rear rows of seating in as little as 14 seconds according to Land Rover. The functionality is built into the Land Rover InControl Remote app, which is available free on iOS and Android.
If you’re note falling from a plane and happen to be actually close to the Discovery itself, there are switches in the rear cargo portion of the vehicle, and on the C-pillar. Finally, you can raise or lower the back two rows from the main dashboard infotainment system touchscreen, too.

We also get a decent look at the camo-painted Discovery in profile as Grylls drives his skydiving pals away, but Land Rover is still holding the big final reveal for September 28, 2016.

917,Missouri court rules against Tesla selling at its own dealerships in the state,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/07/missouri-court-rules-against-tesla-selling-at-its-own-dealerships-in-the-state/,2016/09/07,"
Tesla continues to try to up-end the dealership system in the U.S., which generally requires that franchise-owned dealers sell cars, vs. automakers selling directly via their own wholly owned dealerships. The latest beat in he ongoing battle comes in Missouri, where Cole County Circuit Court Judge Daniel Green decided in favor of the Missouri Automobile Dealers Association (via Autoblog), effectively deciding that while Tesla can own and maintain showrooms in the state via its state dealership licence, it can’t sell cars directly to consumers at those locations.
According to the terms of the judgement, Tesla can still sell its vehicles to Missourians online, and use its physical locations directly. This is the norm for most states where it’s allowed to sell its vehicles, but it’s still barred from selling its vehicles direct to consumers at all in six states.
The company continues to try to turn the state laws in its favor, but it faces strong resistance from powerful dealership lobbies across the country. Ultimately, Tesla wants to operate its own dealerships which can sell direct to customers, as well as selling online, and its argument for doing so is that generally speaking, franchisees don’t have sufficient expertise around EVs to sell them alongside other vehicles, and it also would clearly like to own more of the overall customer experience.
In Missouri, Tesla had attempted to argue that it could issue a franchise agreement to itself, an arrangement which would satisfy the local legal requirements. Judge Green says that the law requires the franchisee be a wholly separate entity, however.
Back in May, the Wall Street Journal reported that Tesla is still trying to convince lawmakers to change their minds about direct sales at the local level, but that it’s also considering mounting a federal case to challenge hold-outs based on a 2013 federal appeals court precedent involving the sale of coffins, wherein a coffin maker bypassed funeral directors in order to sell direct to consumers.

918,Mercedes-Benz and Matternet unveil vans that launch delivery drones,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/07/mercedes-benz-and-matternet-unveil-vans-that-launch-delivery-drones/,2016/09/07,"
Mercedes-Benz Vans and drone tech startup Matternet have created a concept car, or as they’re calling it a Vision Van, that could change the way small packages are delivered across short distances.
The Vision Van’s rooftop serves as a launch and landing pad for Matternet’s new, Matternet M2 drones.
The Matternet M2 drones, which are autonomous, can pick up and carry a package of 4.4 pounds across 12 miles of sky on a single battery charge in real world conditions.
They are designed to reload their payload and swap out batteries without human intervention. They work in conjunction with Mercedes-Benz Vans’ on-board and cloud-based systems so that items within a van are loaded up into the drone, automatically, at the cue of software and with the help of robotic shelving systems within the van.
A self-flying, Matternet M2 drone hoists a package near a shipping container.
 
Matternet designed a hard-shelled case to protect and carry any given cargo. The drone’s payload can transmit data about the contents and destination of a given delivery.
For a logistics company using the Matternet M2 drones or Vision Vans, that data could serve as a kind of proof of delivery, and alert users the instant a package has arrived.
Andreas Raptopoulos, co-founder and CEO of Matternet explained that while all of this sounds and looks like the stuff of sci-fi, the vans with integrated drone technology could be put to immediate good use where regulations allow.
The Vision Van can, for example, launch a Matternet M2 drone with a payload to a final destination that’s not accessible to a van or driver, whether that’s due to traffic in a populated urban area or a lack of safe roads in a more rural or disaster-stricken area.

Or, the drones could fly a package from a distribution center or warehouse to a van so a driver can ultimately take the package down and walk it up to a customer’s doorstep nearby.
A division of Daimler, Mercedes-Benz may be better known for its luxury and sports cars. However, the Mercedes-Benz Vans unit sold 321,000 vehicles in 2015, according to a company financial statement, with popular models in travel and logistics including the Sprinter, Marco Polo, Vito (known as the Metris in the U.S.) and Citan.
According to a company press statement Mercedes-Benz has invested an undisclosed amount in Matternet. According to SEC filings, Matternet has so far raised $9.5 million of a targeted $11.5 million venture funding round.

Raptopolous declined to comment on the filing or the company’s funding status. Executives from Mercedes-Benz Vans were not immediately available for an interview.
Earlier this year, Matternet developed unmanned aircraft systems for UNICEF that are being used to transport blood samples for HIV testing in Malawi. The initiative could speed up the delivery of care to HIV-positive infants across the country where 10,000 children died of HIV-related illnesses in 2014.

919,Motoring community DriveTribe secures $6.5M from 21st Century Fox,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/06/motoring-community-drivetribe-secures-6-5m-from-21st-century-fox/,2016/09/06,"
DriveTribe, the vertical online community for motoring fans to be launched by former Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, has now secured $6.5 million (£4.9 million) from 21st Century Fox. The move comes less than three weeks after the announcement of its $5.5 million Series A funding, led by Breyer Capital and Atomico.
The site expects to launch in November 2016 as the “world’s digital hub for motoring” and has been co-founded by the three celebs, together with their long-time producer/collaborator Andy Wilman, and serial technology entrepreneur Ernesto Schmitt.
The site will feature “Tribes” — basically forums — hosted by the three celebrities, along with invited stars, bloggers, writers and videographers, who generate and curate the content. A content engine will target the best content for each community. It sounds like it will be a like a bunch of motoring Facebook groups lumped together, with some more tech thrown in.
“We saw the DriveTribe platform and we were blown away by its ingenuity,” said Peter Rice, CEO of FOX Networks Group in a statement.
However, the jury is out on whether it will be successful. Most attempts to corral individual celebrities into one platform — such as Tidal — have not fared well.

920,OEMs and startups: The incubator at Jaguar Land Rover HQ,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/06/oems-and-startups-the-incubator-at-jaguar-land-rover-hq/,2016/09/06,"
The first question you might have when learning that Jaguar Land Rover has its technology headquarters in Portland, OR, is, “Why?” There’s an easy answer for that question, said Rupert Poole, Senior Collaborations Manager of Future Technology at the facility in Portland. JLR, as it’s known, already had a relationship with Intel, and Intel is located in a Portland suburb. There’s also a thriving startup culture in Portland, and it’s not hard to travel up and down the West Coast to other tech hubs.
The first JLR facility in Portland, the Open Software Technology Center, opened in July 2014. The nearby JLR Tech Incubator opened six months later and a third building next door to the incubator, the collaborative lab, is undergoing renovations to create space for test chambers and vehicle bays. I got to tour all three — including the very much not-yet-completed lab.
While about a hundred JLR engineers are working on infotainment and connectivity tech to be tested in simulators and eventually introduced into Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles, a handful of startups are down the street developing new technology that may or may not end up being used by the British automaker. All engineers, whether they’re JLR employees or startups, have access to collaborative brainstorming spaces — with walls you can write on and buckets of LEGOs.
The incubator hosts 12 startups each year for six-month periods. “We found that three months is too short,” says Danielle Alexander, the manager of the incubator. The teams get access to space, funding, tools and equipment — including Jaguars and Land Rovers — partnerships, mentors and engineering and technology expertise from the JLR staff.
Like other OEMs that want to work with startups, the JLR Incubator is looking for small teams that have more agility and speed than a century-old automotive manufacturer. It’s also looking for technologies that dovetail with automotive needs rather than overlap, such as augmented reality, connected car, human-machine interface (HMI) and data visualization technologies.
When I visited the facility, I met with the half-dozen startups currently in residence. One, Carfit, is developing a technology directly applicable to the auto industry. Its small, puck-shaped devices attach to the steering wheel and monitor all of its shakes, wobbles and corrections. In the same way that (some) drivers can tell the car is out of alignment or the shocks need replacing, Carfit analyzes the information from the steering wheel and sends the diagnosis to an app.
But not every startup in the incubator has such a direct relationship to the automotive industry. Take Neptune, which is developing a streaming, curated video service for kid-friendly, interactive, educational content. In a connected car, kids could pick and choose and stream at will without the parent in the driver’s seat needing to monitor their every choice. Or SicDrone, a drone that can pivot its rotors for maneuverability or remain stable while flying in wind. This could come in handy when scouting for emergency response or to looking ahead at an uncharted off-road course — something Land Rover drivers have been known to take.
“Infotainment and connectivity are the only parts of a car where consumer expectations are set against other technologies,” Poole said. “All other expectations are set versus automotive technology.” By bringing the cutting edge of connectivity into the incubator, where startups work with the local engineers and have access to 10,000 JLR engineers worldwide, a decades-old company gets access to the latest innovations.

921,Volvo and Autoliv launch joint venture to create self-driving software,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/06/volvo-and-autoliv-launch-joint-venture-to-create-self-driving-software/,2016/09/06,"
Yet another partnership has been forged to help usher in the era of self-driving software: This time, it’s Volvo, which announced (via Reuters) a joint venture with Swedish-American car safety system supplier Autoliv to create autonomous driving. Volvo is already a partner of Uber’s in self-driving cars, and this new venture looks like yet another effort to help propel the automaker ahead of its rivals in the race to full autonomy.
Autoliv has typically worked on safety systems used by all major car manufacturers, including seatbelts, airbags, steering wheels and active says systems including collision avoidance. Autoliv’s work in active safety has helped it transition into autonomous driving tech, and it has moved to increase its capabilities in areas include LiDAR and computer vision. Autoliv has already worked with Volvo on its semi-autonomous vehicle features, including the company’s “Drive Me” suite of offerings, which are similar to Tesla’s Autopilot and which are currently in testing.
The new tie-up between Volvo and Autoliv deepens the relationship, through the formation of a new company with a dedicated staff of around 200 to start, pulled from each parent organization, with a growth goal of reaching up to 600 employees in the relatively near future.
Volvo and Uber announced a $300 million deal which would see the companies collaborate on bringing self-driving Volvo vehicles to market, but that arrangement didn’t involve any staff sharing or the formation of an additional company. Still, Volvo seems to be approaching the autonomous driving space from multiple fronts, and Autoliv’s active safety experience does likely make them a good partner.

922,Daimler begins testing Smart car trunk delivery service with DHL,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/02/daimler-begins-testing-smart-car-trunk-delivery-service-with-dhl/,2016/09/02,"
Packages delivered to the trunk of your car isn’t an entirely new concept; last April, Amazon started testing a service to do just that in partnership with Audi and DHL in Munich. Now, Daimler is getting in the action, with a pilot project also including DHL and Amazon, as well as Allyouneed fresh and Fashion ID that will drop packages in the trunk (“boot” for the Europeans in the crowd) of customer Smart cars in select German cities.
The pilot project will start this fall in Stuttgart, and then roll out to Cologne, Bonn and Berlin shortly after that. Eventually, it’s going to span seven German cities according to Daimler, and will comprise the “biggest in-car delivery test ever performed in German” according to the car maker.
Potential users can sign up to participate at ww.smart.com/drop, and if selected, their cars will be retrofitted with a special Connectivity Box that allows delivery agents to access the vehicles to make the delivery. Smart will also begin shipping a fort with the Connectivity Box pre-installed beginning in Autumn.
Delivery to your car would’ve seemed like the ultimate unnecessary step just a few years ago, but in the modern era of same-day delivery, which can sometimes include turnaround of just a few hours, being able to receive what you want wherever you happen to be actually makes a lot of sense. Smart as a brand is a good fit for this, too; urban commuters are more likely than most to be able to take advantage of quick delivery options.

At IFA 2016 in Berlin, Mercedes-Benz announced a new project called ‘In Car Office’ to incorporate more smart productivity features into your ride. The features are going to go live in Mercedes vehicles during the first half of next year, and will add Microsoft Exchange support, for one, letting your work calendar, to-do list and contacts help your vehicle offer up suggestions about destinations, calls to make and more.
The In Car Office feature obviously isn’t intended to turn your vehicle into a mobile workstation so much as it’s designed to help you more easily accomplish work-related tasks you’d probably field on-the-go anyway.
Mercedes’ In Car Office features will do things like pre-populate the navigation system with destination from your Exchange calendar, and also provide notifications offering to make calls using the in-car voice call system when you have upcoming meetings marked on your calendar. It definitely sounds like something that could lessen distraction and minimize manual input required for tasks that people already (unsafely) try to tackle during longer commutes or road trips during business hours.

Most of us techies agree that optimal travel is teleportation (Star Trek) or apparition (Harry Potter).
The dream is instantaneous point-to-point transport. All business transportation should be evaluated based on how close it comes to approaching this ideal. Because modern travel isn’t instantaneous, our main metrics are productivity — the ability to work while en route — and convenience — how easy is the whole process of getting from one place to the next.
In approaching the teleportation ideal, an airplane’s greatest strength is speed. Air is the fastest option we have. The longer the trip, the greater the advantage for air over other forms of travel. A car’s greatest strengths are simplicity and flexibility. It’s one vehicle from point-to-point, operating on any schedule and any route. Trains offer the greatest productivity but stick to a fixed track. Buses’ greatest strength is cost, but they tend to be a “jack of all trades, master of none.”
Optimizing travel requires balancing speed with simplicity and flexibility. It’s toward this magic ideal where the opportunity exists for travel companies to collaborate in building the flexible systems of the future.
Transforming regional travel
“Driverless cars” is the obligatory buzz phrase these days for any discussion of transportation. But we forget that the promise lies in the wholesale transformation of regional travel.
While most of the press around driverless cars has focused on complex urban settings, most of the real-world tests have been on highways. These are settings with similar speeds and limited variables.
When it comes to regional distances of a few hundred miles or less, there are a wealth of competing travel options — cars, planes, buses, trains. But every option has complications: detours, delays, transfers, distractions and wind resistance are as true for ground as for air. Driverless vehicles offer a tremendous opportunity for airlines and ground-based transportation companies to partner with each other, leveraging their historical strengths to improve travel for everyone.
Traveling the Texas Triangle
Over the past year, I’ve logged flights from my home in Dallas to Thailand, Hong Kong, Argentina, Seattle, New York and San Francisco. In that same time, I’ve traveled by car to conferences in Austin, Houston and College Station. This is the “Texas Triangle” — 18 million people in five major cities, all less than 250 miles apart. It’s a region ripe for experimentation and innovation in travel.
 The dominant challenge to adoption is in changing public opinion in favor of autonomous vehicles.
There are air routes connecting Texas cities. After all, regional, decentralized Texas flights is how Southwest Airlines started. The inconvenience of flying short distances rarely seems worth it to me; the complexity doesn’t outweigh the speed. As much as I love flying, it involves navigating a tremendous number of transitions: getting to the airport (via ride-sharing, public transit or driving to self-parking), checking bags, navigating security, walking to the gate, waiting at the gate, boarding, waiting for takeoff — the actual flight — taxiing to the gate, debarking, walking to baggage claim, waiting at baggage claim and transport to the final destination (via ride-sharing, public transit or rental car).
For longer flights, these steps represent the minority of total travel time. But for Dallas to Houston — the longest leg of the Texas Triangle — the 45-minute flight is a tiny part of a total travel time of 3-4 hours. It’s also challenging to be productive en route because it takes so much time to negotiate all the transitions of the trip. You simply can’t be highly productive during so many micro moments.
If I make the 240-mile drive from Dallas to Houston, my productivity is limited to phone calls and podcasts. But 230 miles of the trip is on highways. In a car with a viable and safe highway driverless mode, 95 percent of the trip would become fully productive time to use a laptop or augmented reality headset, engage in video conference calls or catch a nap.
Even if I have to manually drive the car within cities, I’d still gain 3-5 hours of productive time on highways, depending on traffic. And if there is an interruption because of a wreck, mechanical failure or weather event, I still have all the advantages of a car — the ability to change routes, stop for a meal or pull off at a rest stop to watch a sunset over the Texas horizon.
Forget about rail
In countries with higher population densities than the U.S., high-speed rail has largely replaced regional passenger flights. For instance, airlines in China have stopped flying routes less than 300 miles when there is a competing high-speed rail. However, the U.S. hasn’t built a similar infrastructure. Texas lacks any high-speed rail (at least for now). China’s example is still relevant as we think about inconvenience thresholds in travel.
High-speed rail is widely idealized as a transportation option — and for good reasons: It tends to be highly convenient, connecting city centers in a way that is fast, safe, affordable and comfortable, with a minimum of overhead time and the benefit of a low-carbon footprint. The ultimate example of this would be a hyperloop, if one ever gets built. However, high-speed rails require significant passenger volume to be viable and — where they don’t already exist — significant time and money to plan and implement.
In contrast, cars that can function autonomously on highways can adapt to any scale and to any region, yielding the productivity benefits of high-speed rail across a far greater range of routes and situations.
Why airlines should be getting in on driverless cars
Airlines understand logistics better than any other segment of the travel industry. As autonomous vehicles proliferate, airlines have the opportunity to bring their experience to a new arena. Airlines could partner with ground transportation companies to create the infrastructure to link autonomous vehicle travel to existing flight routes… or perhaps talk to Tesla about piloting its planned electric transit vehicle.
Here’s a potential playbook:

Regional airline routes coexist with autonomous cars. If an airline knows a flight is going to be delayed, it could give customers the option of autonomous transport in lieu of air. This reduces overbooking problems and provides alternatives in the case of weather or mechanical delays.
Some regional airline routes may disappear as airlines contract with driverless car companies to transport passengers directly from home to large airports.
Airlines might have the option to cancel unprofitable flights without stranding passengers; e.g. if a once-daily regional flight is underbooked on a particular day, an airline could cancel the flight and use ground transportation partners to ensure travelers can still complete their trip.

I can imagine a world where booking travel is a far more flexible and consistent process: My ticket gets me from point to point within a promised time period; it’s up to the travel provider to integrate the pieces necessary for my trip to be on time and seamless. Airlines are among the companies best positioned to manage the logistics to compete in this magical world of integrated travel.
Convenience begets trust

A Proposed California Law Would Require Drivers For Driverless Cars


The hardware to make driverless cars a reality is largely in place. The software continuously improves, making the hardware more useful. The dominant challenge to adoption is in changing public opinion in favor of autonomous vehicles. There are plenty of responsible and compelling arguments for and against autonomous cars. Increased safety, reduced costs and environmental consciousness must be balanced against software bugs and cybersecurity threats. But, ultimately, I believe the road to adoption will be paved by a demand for convenience and consistency.
Humanity has an amazing track record of trust. With every innovation of the internet era, we have shown a willingness to give up privacy, personal information and personal security in return for convenience. Similarly, with autonomous vehicles, our concerns will likely fade once we experience the new technology. Google’s driverless car testing supports this idea: “Within about five minutes [behind the wheel], everybody thought the car worked well, and after that, they just trusted it to work,” reported the head of Google’s self-driving car program.
Very soon, from the front seat of our driverless cars, we’ll be able to see the next future of travel: autonomous airplanes. This opens a whole new set of opportunities for companies to collaborate on end-to-end travel. For travelers like you and I, we’ll be one step closer to Star Trek. Beam me up!

926,Nvidia and Baidu partner on a ‘top-to-bottom’ platform for self-driving cars,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/31/nvidia-and-baidu-partner-on-a-top-to-bottom-platform-for-self-driving-cars/,2016/08/31,"
Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jen-Hsun Huang revealed a new partnership on stage at Baidu’s annual Baidu World conference today. This partnership with Baidu will see Nvidia and the Chinese tech giant work together on building a comprehensive autonomous driving platform.
“We’re going to bring together the technical capabilities, our expertise in AI, and the skills of two world-class companies,” Huang said, noting that the partnership will the AI and deep learning skills of both companies. “By combining these capabilities, we will be able to deliver a cloud-to-car architecture platform that promises to get cars on the road in the next several years.”
Nvidia and Baidu will be building an end-to-end solution for self-driving cars, according to Huang. The end goal is a platform that allows Baidu to get a self-driving taxi fleet on the road, and the same platform is also designed for use in OEM cars, tied into the same network. Huang said this means it’s going to be available for branded car OEM consumer vehicle offerings, as well as fleets of driverless commercial vehicles. He noted it will be a “completely open” platform, meaning they’re very hopeful other automotive OEMs will come on board.
Huang also talked about deep learning and AI generally, and Nvidia’s commitment to both across a variety of industries. He noted that beginning six years ago, even “before many people in Silicon Valley,” Baidu and CEO Robin Li and were investing deeply in this area. Nvidia has been partnering with Baidu on computer learning research for years now, Huang said.
Nvidia introduced its PX 1 self-driving car development platform at CES two years ago, and debuted its more advanced PX 2 second generation version of the same at CES this past January.

Baidu received an Autonomous Vehicle Testing Permit from the California DMV, the company revealed today. This paves the way for Baidu USA to begin testing its self-driving car technologies on public roads in California, which it says it will do soon. The Baidu autonomous driving research team in the U.S. was announced earlier this year, saying it was targeting reaching a 100-person research team in Silicon Valley.
Baidu also recently invested with Ford a total of $150 million in Velodyne, a supplier of key LiDAR components used in autonomous driving systems. The investment was designed to help improve the cost and yield of LiDAR components, which are currently expensive to make at scale, in the volumes you’d need for a proper production launch of self-driving vehicles.
While Baidu does say that it’s going to “start testing… autonomous driving technologies on public roads very soon in California,” according to a statement by Baidu SVP Jing Wang, it doesn’t say how far it’s progressed in its Silicon Valley recruitment drive, but getting permission to start road testing in California should help its efforts overall.
Baidu will still face the same requirements as other companies testing autonomous driving vehicles in the state, which currently means there must be a driver and driving controls present in the testing cars.

The US Department of Energy has awarded $8 million in Small Business Vouchers to 43 businesses, including ten projects aimed at making hydrogen fuel cells cheaper and more efficient, and six projects that will improve vehicle fuel efficiency, including better batteries.
In addition to funding from the DOE, participants in this second round of the SBV project will be working with 12 of the DOE’s national laboratories to accelerate the development of their technologies. For example, Nzyme2HC is paired with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to generate hydrogen for fuel cells using, among other things, industrial waste. The SBV award allows Nzyme2HC to prototype and test the cleaner — and potentially cheaper — hydrogen fuel at NREL.
Vehicle technologies range from improved computer modeling and simulations to fuel innovations. Saratoga Energy is developing a process to manufacture graphite from carbon dioxide to be used in lithium-ion batteries for EVs, while Sylvatex is designing a nanoparticle fuel system to reduce emissions and incorporate renewables in petroleum with assistance from the Argonne National Laboratory.
The SBV project isn’t just for vehicles and related technology; other awards were in the Bioenergy, Buildings, Geothermal, Solar, Water, and Wind categories. Round one of the project launched in March with 33 vouchers totaling $6.7 million awarded. To get a piece of that funding pie in a future round, visit the project’s website to apply. More info will be available there in October 2016.

Mike Judge’s Silicon Valley faces a serious challenge in that it has to keep outdoing itself to properly satirize the real Silicon Valley, where crazy pants crap happens all the time. So it’s not surprising to see stuff from the show bleed into the world of real Valley startups, as with the new promotion from Airbnb-for-cars startup Turo that kicks off today.
For goofs, Turo is now renting out the car of Erlich Bachman, the pseudo-successful entrepreneur character whose one claim to fame prior to the events of the show is a decent exit for his startup Aviato. His Aviato-branded Ford Escape is now a real thing you can rent on Turo’s peer-to-peer car rental network, starting at $49 per day for this fine vintage 2006 automobile.
So just to clarify, because again, the line between reality and parody is super thin when it comes to things like HBO’s Valley-set comedy, this is a real car listing for a vehicle you can actually book. And there’s an actual profile on Turo for an “Erlich B.” with a single rating from someone who looks a lot like Business Insider’s Kif Leswing.

930,Get ready to share the road with cars that have no one behind the wheel,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/31/cars-without-drivers-state-laws/,2016/08/31,"
The day when you pull up next to a car in traffic and find no one sitting at the steering wheel is probably closer than you think. As TechCrunch’s Lora Kolodny noted yesterday, California has amendments to a bill before its legislative assembly that would allow for the testing of cars without any driver in the seat at all on actual roads. And earlier this week, Michigan’s state legislators introduced a bill that would also allow testing without a safety driver present, which has bipartisan support and is set to be discussed at a state senate hearing today.
Both bills do limit the situations in which these kinds of driverless cars can operate; California’s bill specifies speeds under 35 miles per hour in pilot projects, and operation only within approved areas (but those areas could include public roads).
Michigan’s proposed law would allow the self-driving cars on any state roads, including highways and interstate routes. The only real limitation here would be that it includes a provision that carmakers and its suppliers (the creators of the autonomous driving system used, for instance) be held liable for any resulting accidents.
Currently, every state requires that a human driver be at the wheel. In Michigan’s case, then, the bill represents a significant economic advantage, and a way to keep car tech research and development within the state. The introduction of the proposed amendments in California is likely only going to speed up Michigan’s legislative process on the matter, especially since the bill already has support from both Republican and Democratic legislative representatives.
The bottom line is that one way or another, state lawmakers are very likely going to allow vehicles without humans at the wheel very soon. Yes, in a test capacity, and potentially in limited driving situations, but still on public roads, in situations where human drivers will see them and interact with them.
Here it comes.

931,"Uber turns on electric vehicles in the UK, starting with 50 cars in London",https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/31/uber-turns-on-electric-vehicles-in-uk-starting-with-50-cars-in-london/,2016/08/31,"
The race for who will take the lead in the next generation of automotive technology is on, and today Uber is kicking off a program that it hopes will help put it in pole position. Today, the transportation-on-demand behemoth is launching a new electric car service in the UK, in partnership with Nissan and China’s BYD, where it will offer leasing (not purchasing) options for fully-electric cars (BYD E6s and Nissan Leafs) to its drivers, as well as include those vehicles in the mix of cars that it offers to passengers for journeys.
“The cars through this partnership are for rent, not for purchase, and will be at rates lower than the cheapest rentals in the market for other private hire vehicles (in order to encourage drivers to make the switch from their existing vehicle),” a spokesperson from Uber tells us. “Obviously running costs are quite a bit lower too – although how much lower obviously depends what car they are switching from.”
Uber is starting first with 50 vehicles in London and — if all goes as planned — it will expand the service to another UK city in coming months, and projects to have “hundreds” of all-electric vehicles on the roads in the UK by next year.
Uber’s move to expand into electric cars is significant for a few reasons: for one, it builds on the company’s efforts to make sure that whatever direction cars may be moving in the years ahead, it will have a place at the table as one of the companies leading the charge.
Uber may not (yet) be fully using its own self-driving vehicles, which go hand-in-hand with self-driving cars in the next generation of automotive technology. But as a large company in the transportation industry, programs like this will help Uber have the ability to influence how these cars are made by third parties, and will also give it a good route into being a middle man in the leasing of these vehicles, potentially developing that business into a useful revenue stream to diversify from basic transportation (or delivery) on-demand services.
Moving into leasing services is a route that companies like Didi in China (which recently acquired/merged with Uber’s business in the country) and Ola in India have also taken in China to expand their businesses.
(Didi, as a side note, is also making further moves to expand its reach in another way: today the company announced that it would work with some 50 other transportation-on-demand businesses to provide a platform to help them organise and look for ride requests more efficiently. You can think of this as Didi’s equivalent to Amazon or Alibaba’s marketplace, where they are offering their transportation platform as a service to independent vendors.)
Second of all, it’s a smart move to improve Uber’s profile, both with lawmakers and regulators in the cities where it operates as well as with consumers and drivers, too. As a company with automotive transportation as its core building block, making investments into further electric car transportation and figuring out effective, alternative forms of fuel beyond gasoline to improve he environment, especially in large cities clogged with pollution (London, as an old city, has a lot of homes on very busy roads) are very obvious moves in Uber’s larger corporate social responsibility strategy, and also more directly to help improve its image, which has not always been positive.
Electric trends at Uber
The partnership being announced today plays on some earlier forays that Uber has made into adding electric vehicles into its fleet.
These include a trial that Uber started last year in Chicago, also with BYD, to offer electric cars as part of its UberX service, which offers rides in smaller, private-style vehicles for a lower cost than Uber’s higher-end tiers. An Uber spokesperson tells us that Uber is aiming the UK service at the same tier of users. We have asked how the Chicago trial is progressing and will update as we find out more.
There have been other electric car projects from Uber as well: they include a one-month trial earlier this year in South Africa, which has already ended. And in Portugal earlier this year, Uber also trialled an electric car service called Uber Green for three months. (Again, we’ve asked Uber for an update on these two as well.)
The difference with the UK project is that the cars will be part of the bigger mix of offerings, meaning as a passenger you might end up in an electric vehicle, or a Prius hybrid, or a more standard car.
Unlike some transport companies, such as Uber’s competitor in the UK, Addison Lee, Uber’s fleet is not owned by the company itself but comes as part of its deals with drivers to use its platform. That, essentially, gives Uber some flexibility in how it grows and a mandate to encourage and vet vehicles on the platform, but ultimately it must also rely on those drivers to have the initiative to upgrade. Uber says that some 60% of rides in London already take place in Prius-style hybrid cars.
“People already associate Uber with hybrid cars, but we now want to go a big step further with fully electric cars on the road from today,” said Jo Betram, the GM for Uber in the UK. “We are determined to use technology to help tackle the challenge of air pollution in London and across the UK. Our car-sharing service has already saved more than 1.3 million miles and 231 metric tonnes of CO2. With electric vehicles – and more people sharing their journey and leaving their own cars at home – there’s even more we can do.”
As with the other projects, Uber’s working with other groups to monitor the progress of its electric car service. The Energy Saving Trust (EST) will run a study “into the feasibility of running large numbers of electric private hire vehicles in the UK. In particular, the EST will research the experience, driving patterns and economics of private hire drivers using electric cars, and the capacity of London’s current network of charging points to support these vehicles.”
“We are delighted to be working with Uber to help realise and build upon their ambition to add a significant number of electric vehicles to their app,” said Andrew Benfield, Group Director of Transport at the Energy Saving Trust, in a statement. We hope that this trial represents an important step in Uber’s contribution towards the wider efforts to improve air quality in the capital – the benefits of which will be felt by all.”

Virtuality Reality And The Future Of Music




On a recent episode of a podcast called “The Watch,” one of the hosts made a joke about “grabbing the aux cord” in a friend’s car to play new music. In an age when self-driving cars could be whizzing us around cities in the next decade, it’s strange to think that we haven’t yet come up with a great solution for a much simpler problem — how to make listening to digital music in the car a more seamless experience.
Despite all the amazing streaming music, online radio and podcasting services launched over the years, using them in the car remains a largely clunky experience. Most still require either a Bluetooth or corded connection, and, of those, many require using the phone to interact with the service rather than the in-car dashboard. It’s not that far removed from the days of using a cassette adapter to get a Discman to play through the car speakers.
The question is, who will solve this problem… Silicon Valley or Detroit?
Both have a vested interest in making it easier to stream your favorite music app in the car. After all, according to the Radio Advertising Bureau, more than half of all radio consumption takes place in the car. And while traditional radio remains the go-to format for music in the car, its share is shrinking. According to Nielsen, the time spent listening to radio fell 35 percent, to less than 14 hours per week, between 2007 to 2015. Meanwhile, according to the 2016 Infinite Dial report, 57 percent of Americans now use online radio monthly.
The issue is control. With traditional terrestrial radio (or physical tapes/CDs), auto manufacturers controlled the interface and radio stations simply provided the programming. But digital music services place just as much emphasis on the user experience as they do the programming. The resulting struggle only adds to the already glacial pace of in-car audio progress.
Carmakers have to be great at predicting tech trends many years down the road — that’s something even VCs can’t do all that well.
To be sure, there are plenty of technical reasons for slow progress. One is that cars take a long time to design and manufacture. That 2017 model you’ve been eyeing has been in development since 2010, before Spotify even existed in the U.S. In the last seven years, countless music platforms have come and gone, making it difficult for carmakers to cut deals with them and expect any type of longevity. While podcasts existed in 2010, they weren’t the global juggernaut they are now — and who knows if the format will hold up? Carmakers have to be great at predicting tech trends many years down the road — that’s something even VCs can’t do all that well.
Connectivity is also a major challenge, and something carmakers don’t have much control over. Anyone who has tried to listen to satellite radio on a long drive has probably encountered a handful of dead spots — not a great listener experience. Because relatively few cars have Wi-Fi, building a dashboard that allows users to sample any online radio station or stream music or podcasts is quite difficult; the network simply isn’t there to support it.
Both auto manufacturers and tech companies are attacking these pain points more rapidly of late. General Motors, for instance, says it had more than a million 4G LTE-connected cars on the road last year, with more on the way. Ford says it plans to add the same to its SYNC in-car entertainment platform. But with more than 300 million cars on the road, we’re just barely getting started.
Google, meanwhile, unveiled the Android Auto system in 2014 to ease the integration between Android phones and supporting in-car dashboards. Apple made a similar move last year with Apple CarPlay.

But beyond that, streaming services and apps need to start designing products with an eye toward the in-car user. While a home screen with a million options might work on a laptop or a phone, it’s terrible for a driver who wants to make a split-second decision about which station or playlist they want to pick next (let alone the legal and safety regulations in-vehicle apps must go through from government safety boards).
Simply releasing an API and asking the automotive world to “have at it” is not enough. Services need to work on in-car UI improvements themselves, not just focus on the phone. They also need to invest in curating content designed for drivers, making it easy for them to find and enjoy. There has been talk that at some point in the next few years, all the apps we use in the car will communicate with each other and simply pick music based on routes, weather and moods. But until then, a great playlist or show about hitting the road should suffice.
Again, the issue is control. Detroit remains saddled with an image of crumbling buildings and poisoned water, but after a recent visit I have first-hand knowledge of the innovation taking place there to turn things around. Smart, savvy businesspeople like Dan Gilbert are investing heavily in the area. People have the wrong notion of the city, which is rebounding with a host of new tech startups and University of Michigan talent.
If automakers get the connected car right, it could be a huge boon for Detroit. The city has always been a great music town, being the birthplace of Motown, Techno and more. It could very easily become a music tech hub, as well, as the rise of the connected car draws both companies and jobs to town to work with local carmakers.

933,Google said to undercut Uber with expanded ride-share service in San Francisco,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/30/google-said-to-undercut-uber-with-expanded-ride-share-service-in-san-francisco/,2016/08/30,"
Google is running its own ride-sharing service in San Francisco, The Wall Street Journal reports. The move would put Google in direct, immediate competition with Uber, which helps explain even further the recent departure of Alphabet executive David Drummond from Uber’s board. Google’s new offering piloted in May, according to the WSJ, and uses the Google-owned Waze app to connect commuters for shared carpooling.
The plan is apparently to open up said program to all San Francisco residents starting this fall, with an eye toward expanding it further provided that works out. And unlike Uber, this is more of a matchmaking service, which brings together riders with drivers headed in the same direction. Fees are going to be low, too — the report says Google is intentionally keeping them low to keep this a peer-to-peer co-driving arrangement, rather than something that professional drivers will want to use in a dedicated capacity, like Uber and Lyft.
Waze’s operational model to date has focused on connecting drivers via crowdsourced navigation information. Users report things like accidents, roadside obstacles, storms and traffic jams, and these are immediately available to other drivers. Shortly after Google acquired Waze in 2013, it started using its crowdsourced navigation data in the primary Google Maps app, as well.
While the pilot originally limited ridership to around 25,000 SF-based employees of large tech companies, including Google, with a maximum of two rides a day, the new expansion will open up access to “anyone with the Waze app,” according to the WSJ, on both the rider and driver side of the equation.
While the driver model employed by both Uber and Google is different, the ultimate aim of both might be the same: driverless taxis. Google is said to be considering including its driverless cars in a ride-sharing model, the WSJ notes, and recent business unit changes suggest it is thinking more seriously about how best to bring its driverless vehicles to market.
At one time, Google and Uber seemed to have a very close relationship, which included a sizeable investment from Google in the on-demand ride company, and an arrangement that brought Uber inside the official Google Maps app as an additional mode of transportation option.
Lately, though, the relationship has changed. I’ve heard from a very reliable source that internally, Uber is getting increasingly serious about reducing its dependence on Google’s mapping products entirely, which is in line with what the Financial Times reported in late July.
We reached out to Google for more information, but they did not immediately respond to our request.

934,More details on Audi’s Tesla Model S competitor emerge,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/30/more-details-on-audis-tesla-model-s-competitor-emerge/,2016/08/30,"
Audi’s upcoming four-door luxury electric car will have a 311-mile range, along with Level 4 self-driving features (essentially full autonomy, for those keeping track) and three separate electric motors, according to a new report from Autocar. The car is set to go head-to-head with the Model S, based on these new stats, and will likely be called the “A9 e-tron” when it goes on sale sometime in 2020, the publication says.
The range is in line with what Tesla says its new P100D option package will offer for Model S owners, though Autocar says that the Audi A9 e-tron will have a 95kWh battery to achieve that range, rather than the 100kWh version Tesla employs to get 315 miles as measured by EPA standards.
The powertrain for the upcoming vehicle is said to feature three electric motors that combined produce 429 brake horsepower (bhp), with a drive mode that can boost it to 496 bhp for short stints. Audi is looking at electric drivetrain tuning as one way where it will be able to offer a differentiating advantage to potential consumers.
Another option offered to potential A9 e-tron buyers will be a wireless inductive charging option, with a charge rate of 11kW (Plugless, an aftermarket option for Tesla Model S, offers a 7.2kW rate that provides about 20-25 miles of range per hour, for context). The option comes with an automated parking feature that will ensure the car positions itself correctly over a charging pad in an owner’s garage, Autocar says.
Audi has already announced that its A8 will get Level 3 automation next year, but Level 4 in a production car by 2020 is still an ambitious target (though one shared by a growing number of carmakers and tech companies worldwide). It’s also unlikely the Model S that this A9 e-tron competes with in 2020 will look like the Model S of today – Musk has hinted that a big leap in Tesla’s autonomous driving tech is on the way soon. Still, it sounds like Audi will be in the ring when the electric self-driving royal rumble goes down.

936,"NHTSA releases raw 2015 traffic fatality data, calls for tech companies to analyze",https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/29/nhtsa-releases-raw-2015-traffic-fatality-data-calls-for-tech-companies-to-analyze/,2016/08/29,"
The number of traffic fatalities in the U.S. in 2015 was up 7.2 percent from the year prior, to 35,092, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is doing things a little differently this year with respect to that data, since it’s a troubling departure from the overall recent trend of a decreasing total number of annual traffic-related deaths.
The NHTSA is today offering an open data set of anonymized but detailed info regarding these accidents, three months earlier than it typically does. It’s also asking directly for input from outside organizations in analyzing said data to help identify what’s causing the significant and unusual increase, and hopefully provide some answers about what might be done to turn things around.
The government agency is asking for feedback from pretty much anyone, be they “a non-profit, a tech company, or just a curious citizen,” and it’s outlined some specific questions that might help in determining how to go about sifting through the data:


How might improving economic conditions around the country change how Americans are getting around? What models can we develop to identify communities that might be at a higher risk for fatal crashes?
How might climate change increase the risk of fatal crashes in a community?
How might we use studies of attitudes toward speeding, distracted driving, and seat belt use to better target marketing and behavioral change campaigns?
How might we monitor public health indicators and behavior risk indicators to target communities that might have a high prevalence of behaviors linked with fatal crashes (drinking, drug use/addiction, etc.)? What countermeasures should we create to address these issues?


Already, the NHTSA has some committed partners, including Google’s Waze, StreetLight Data, CARTO and Mapbox. And while the bulleted questions it asks above tend to shy away from identifying automated driving technology as one possible solution, it does acknowledge this as one specifically interesting line of inquiry farther down in its official announcement of the news of the data set’s availability:
We’re also looking to accelerate technologies that may make driving safer, including connected and highly automated vehicles.
It’s clear that the NHTSA wants to do something as urgently as possible to address this disturbing change in the trend of the past few years. Asking tech companies and others to participate in this call to action, and providing the data to work with, could indeed be an effective first step.

938,How connected cars are turning into revenue-generating machines,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/28/how-connected-cars-are-turning-into-revenue-generating-machines/,2016/08/28,"

History repeats herself, but she mumbles. Some have expressed that she enjoys rhymes or puns. One must lean in close and listen carefully to understand exactly what she’s getting at. Most of the time we can only in retrospect discern what she was trying to say.
Sometimes, though, history’s intent is clear. Evidence suggests a chain of events that will yield to an educated guess of the near future. That’s where we stand right now with the state of connected cars: History is repeating itself, with a slight variation. There is a close correspondence in the patterns of disruption when you compare the future of connected cars to the past of the smartphone industry.
At some point within the next two to three years, consumers will come to expect car connectivity to be standard, similar to the adoption curve for GPS navigation. As this new era begins, the telecom metric of ARPU will morph into ARPC (average revenue per car). Note: In this case, the term “connected” brings together related concepts, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and evolving cellular networks, including 3G, 4G/LTE, 5G, etc.
In that time frame, automotive OEMs will see a variety of revenue-generating touch points for connected vehicles at gas stations, electric charging stations and more. We also should expect progressive mobile carriers to gain prominence as essential links in the automotive value chain within those same two to three years.
Early in 2016, that transitional process began with the quiet but dramatic announcement of a statistic that few noted at the time. The industry crossed a critical threshold in the first quarter when net adds of connected cars (32 percent) rose above the net adds of smartphones (31 percent) for the very first time. At the top of the mobile carrier chain, AT&T led the world with around eight million connected cars already plugged into its network.
The next big event to watch for in the development of ARPC will be when connected cars trigger a significant redistribution of revenue among the value chain players. In this article, I will focus mostly on recurring connectivity-driven revenue. I will also explore why automakers must develop deep relationships with mobile carriers and Tier-1s to hold on to their pieces of the pie in the connected-car market by establishing control points.
After phones, cars will be the biggest category for mobile-data consumption.
It’s important to note here that my conclusions on the future of connected cars are not shared by everyone. One top industry executive at a large mobile carrier recently asked me, “Why do we need any other form of connectivity when we already have mobile phones?” Along the same lines, some connected-car analysts have suggested that eSIM technology will encourage consumers to simply add to their existing wireless plans connectivity in their cars.
Although there are differing points of view, it’s clear to me that built-in embedded-SIM for connectivity will prevail over tethering with smartphones. The role of Tier-1s will be decisive for both carriers and automakers as they build out the future of the in-car experience, including infotainment, telematics, safety, security and system integration services.
The sunset of smartphone growth
Consider the U.S. mobile market as a trendsetter for the developed world in terms of data-infused technology. You’ll notice that phone revenues are declining. Year-over-year sales of mobiles have registered a 6.5 percent drop in North America and have had an even more dramatic 10.8 percent drop in Europe. This is because of a combination of total market saturation and economic uncertainty, which encourages consumers to hold onto their phones longer.
While consumer phone upgrades have slowed, non-phone connected devices are becoming a significant portion of net-adds and new subscriptions. TBR analyst Chris Antlitz summed up the future mobile market: “What we are seeing is that the traditional market that both carriers [AT&T and Verizon] go after is saturated, since pretty much everyone who has wanted a cell phone already has one… Both companies are getting big into IoT and machine-to-machine and that’s a big growth engine.”
At the same time, AT&T and Verizon are both showing a significant uptick in IoT revenue, even though we are still in the early days of this industry. AT&T crossed the $1 billion mark and Verizon posted earnings of $690 million in the IoT category for last year, with 29 percent of that total in the fourth quarter alone.
Data and telematics
While ARPU is on the decline, data is consuming a larger portion of the pie. Just consider some astonishing facts about data usage growth from Cisco’s Visual Networking Index 2016. Global mobile data traffic grew 74 percent over the past year, to more than 3.7 exabytes per month. Over the past 10 years, we’ve seen a 4,000X growth in data usage. After phones, cars will be the biggest category for mobile-data consumption.
Most cars have around 150 different microprocessor-controlled sub-systems built by different functional units. The complexity of integrating these systems adds to the time and cost of manufacturing. Disruptive companies like Tesla are challenging that model with a holistic design of telematics. As eSIM becomes a standard part of the telematics control unit (TCU), it could create one of the biggest disruptive domino effects the industry has seen in recent years. That’s why automakers must develop deep relationships with mobile carriers and Tier-1s.
The consumer life cycle for connected cars will initially have to be much longer than it is for smartphones.
Virtualization of our cars is inevitable. It will have to involve separate but interconnected systems because the infrastructure is inherently different for control versus convenience networks. Specifically, instrument clusters, telematics and infotainment environments have very different requirements than those of computing, storage and networking. To create a high-quality experience, automakers will have to work through hardware and software issues holistically.
Already we see Apple’s two-year iPhone release schedule expanding to a three-year span because of gentler innovations and increasing complexity. The consumer life cycle for connected cars will initially have to be much longer than it is for smartphones because of this deep integration required for all the devices, instruments and functionalities that operate the vehicle.
Five factors unique to connected cars
Disruption is everywhere within the auto industry, similar to the disruption that shook out telecom. However, there are several critical differences:


Interactive/informative surface. The mobile phone has one small screen with all the technology packed in behind it. Inside a car, nearly every surface could be transformed into an interactive interface. Beyond the instrumentation panel, which has been gradually claiming more real estate on the steering wheel, there will be growth in backseat and rider-side infotainment screens. (Semi-) autonomous cars will present many more possibilities.

Processing power. The cloud turned mobile phones into smart clients with all the heavy processing elsewhere, but each car can contain a portable data center all its own. Right now, the NVIDIA Tegra X1 mobile processor for connected cars, used to demonstrate its Drive CX cockpit visualizations, can handle one trillion floating-point operations per second (flops). That’s roughly the same computing power as a 1,600-square-foot supercomputer from the year 2000.

Power management. The size and weight of phones were constrained for many years by the size of the battery required. The same is true of cars, but in terms of power and processing instead of the physical size and shape of the body frame. Consider apps like Pokémon Go, which are known as battery killers because of their extensive use of the camera for augmented reality and constant GPS usage. In the backseat of a car, Pokémon Go could run phenomenally with practically no affect on the car battery. Perhaps car windows could even serve as augmented reality screens.

Risk factors. This is the No. 1 roadblock to connected cars right now. The jump from consumer-grade to automotive-grade security is just too great for comfort. Normally, when somebody hacks a phone, nobody gets hurt physically. A cybersecurity report this year pointed out that connected cars average 100 million lines of code, compared to only 8 million for a Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II fighter jet. In other words, security experts have a great deal of work to do to protect connected cars from hackers and random computer errors.

Emotional affinity. Phones are accessories, but a car is really an extension of the driver. You can see this aspect in the pride people display when showing off their cars and their emotional attachment to their cars. This also explains why driverless cars and services like Uber are experiencing a hard limit on their market penetration. For the same reasons, companies that can’t provide flawless connectivity in cars could face long-lasting damage to their brand reputations.

Software over hardware
The value in connected cars will increasingly concentrate in software and applications over the hardware. The connected car will have a vertical hardware stack closely integrated with a horizontal software stack. To dominate the market, a player would need to decide where their niche lies within the solution matrix.
However, no matter how you view the hardware players and service stack, there is a critical role for mobility, software and services. These three will form the framework for experiences, powered by analytics, data and connectivity. Just as content delivered over the car radio grew to be an essential channel for ad revenue in the past, the same will be true in the future as newer forms of content consumption arise from innovative content delivery systems in the connected car.
In the big picture, though, connectivity is only part of the story.
As the second-most expensive lifetime purchase (after a home) for the majority of consumers, a car is an investment unlike any other. Like fuel and maintenance, consumers will fund connectivity as a recurring expense, which we could see through a variety of vehicle touch points. There’s the potential for carriers to partner with every vehicle interaction that’s currently on the market, as well as those that will be developed in the future.
When consumers are filling up at the gas pump, they could pay via their connected car wallet. In the instance of charging electric cars while inside a store, consumers could also make payments on the go using their vehicles. The possibilities for revenue generation through connected cars are endless. Some automakers may try the Kindle-like model to bundle the hardware cost into the price of the car, but most mobile carriers will prefer it to be spread out into a more familiar pricing model with a steady stream of income.
Monetization of the connected car

Once this happens and carriers start measuring ARPC, it will force other industry players to rethink their approach more strategically. For example, bundling of mobile, car and home connectivity will be inevitable for app, data and entertainment services as an integrated experience. In the big picture, though, connectivity is only part of the story. Innovative carriers will succeed by going further and perfecting an in-car user experience that will excite consumers in ways no one can predict right now. As electric vehicles (EVs), hydrogen-powered fuel cells and advances in solar gain market practicality, cars may run without gas, but they will not run without connectivity.
The first true killer app for connected cars is likely to be some form of new media, and the monetization potential will be vast. With Gartner forecasting a market of 250 million connected cars on the road by 2020, creative methods for generating revenue streams in connected cars won’t stop there. Over the next few years, we will see partnerships proliferate among industry players, particularly mobile carriers. The ones who act fast enough to assume a leadership role in the market now will drive away with an influential status and a long-term win — if history has anything to say about it.

939,HopSkipDrive wants to be the Uber for kids,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/26/hopskipdrive-wants-to-be-the-uber-for-kids/,2016/08/26," 


TechCrunch recently went down south to Los Angeles for our mini-meetup and to catch up with the region’s burgeoning tech scene. 
One of the startups that caught our attention is HopSkipDrive, which aims to be an Uber for picking up your kids. Uber passengers need to be at least 18-years of age to ride alone, so HopSkipDrive hopes to solve a transportation problem for busy parents.
“We’re really filling a niche that isn’t in general rideshare,” CEO Joanna McFarland told TechCrunch in the above video. The three co-founders are all mothers and the team felt that “there had to be a better way” to get their children where they need to be. 
Armed with $14 million in capital from Upfront Ventures, FirstMark Capital and others, the downtown Los Angeles-based startup hopes that they can provide a safe ridesharing option for children. With a focus on safety, the startup says it looks for drivers who double as caregivers.
“We’re incredibly proud of the 15 point safety certification process,” co-founder and head of policy Carolyn Yashari Becher told TechCrunch. She touted HopSkipDrive’s background checks and fingerprinting. She also emphasized that their drivers have prior experience working with children, ranging from nannies to teachers. 
Unlike Uber, the app is not on-demand. Users pre-select times and schedule a driver for pickup.
Kids are told to select a secret password to ensure that the right driver picks them up and parents can follow along with their journey through the GPS-tracking on the app.
Yet while many parents empathize with the need for such a service, competitors like Shuddle found that the business was too difficult to execute. The startup recently shut down, with HopSkipDrive acquiring some of the remaining business.
But McFarland said that she believes HopSkipDrive will prevail because the “authenticity of the brand and who we are as founders” inspires the passion behind the service.
HopSkipDrive is currently available in Los Angeles and San Francisco. They hope to expand soon to other regions.

The Google equivalent in every major market where Google doesn’t really play is making a self-driving car of some kind, and Russia is the latest to join the fray. Yandex is the company in question, which operates Russia’s leading search engine, along with a host of other going concerns. Add to that list a driverless minibus, which the tech company is creating in partnership with Russian truck maker Kamaz, NAMI, a government-funded research organization focused on the automotive industry and Daimler, which is already running its own separate tests with self-driving multi-rider transportation.
As reported by Fortune, the Yandex part of the puzzle will be contributions from its work in computer vision, AI and speech recognition tech, while NAMI will offer the testing and research facility and Kamaz will presumably lend its manufacturing prowess to actually building the micro-bus vehicles.
Yandex isn’t wasting too much time getting its first foray into self-driving off the ground — Forbes says that NAMI will begin testing the bus on closed courses next year. The vehicles can seat 12 and have a max range of around 200 km (124 miles), which is about double the range of Olli, the self-driving 12-seat passenger bus operating now in Washington, DC. Yandex’s self-driving experiment will also let passengers specify their destination via smartphone app, making it a little bit more like an on-demand group taxi.

941,Google hires Airbnb’s Shaun Stewart to help bring self-driving cars to market,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/26/google-hires-airbnbs-shaun-stewart-to-help-bring-self-driving-cars-to-market/,2016/08/26,"
Google has a new director at its self-driving car unit: Shaun Stewart, former head of Airbnb’s vacation rentals business, and CEO at TripAdvisor prior to that. Stewart’s entire career has essentially been spent in the hospitality industry, which makes him an interesting pick for the role at Google, where his role will be to help with the commercializations of Google’s self-driving tech, according to Reuters.
Stewart’s hiring follows the appointment of four Hyundai Motor America CEO John Krafcik in 2015 as the set-driving car unit’s CEO. Krafcik and Stewart bring a very different kind of talent to the table, with more experience commercializing vehicles and services at scale compared to the likes of outgoing project lead Chris Urmson, who came from an academic research background prior to leading Google’s efforts before his departure earlier this month.
Looking at Stewart’s professional history, the picture painted is of an experienced executive with a focus on the short-term rental-based device industry. That’s a skill set that should complement any commercial self-driving car service put to market by Google, since the most likely business model would be on-demand hailing with trip-based billing for short-term engagements.
With Krafcik bringing his expertise of the consumer car market, and Stewart adding insight from the short-term hospitality rental industry, Google’s starting to put together the kind of executive team you could reasonably see heading up a self-driving car subsidiary that actually operates as a consumer-facing business. And time is getting short in terms of being first to market with that kind of offering. Exciting times, indeed.

942,Here’s Baidu’s new all-electric self-driving test car,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/26/heres-baidus-new-all-electric-self-driving-test-car/,2016/08/26,"
Self-driving cars have a tendency to become more adorable as big tech companies iterate their design, and Baidu’s new modified Chery eQ all-electric test vehicle is no exception. It resembles Google’s updated self-driving car, the panda-like EV, but it’s got more cabin room and still uses an existing vehicle platform for the basic car body and drivetrain, fitted with a sensor array up top for autonomous features.
Baidu had been using a fleet of modified 3-series vehicles from BMW, with tests expanding to the U.S. earlier this year. The firm also recently co-invested in LiDAR-maker Velodyne with Ford, with the two companies putting a combined $150 million into helping the California supplier make its sensor components more affordable for mass market production.

The new driverless cars from Baidu are designed for use in China, where it plans to release them across the country with the aim of strategically building out their mapping tech, including collecting data about local traffic infrastructure.
Long-term, Baidu is looking to put together a self-driving fleet of cars to buy used as a shared public transportation option, which it aims to actually field for public use by 2018, in limited area on a standard loop in China.

943,Volkswagen’s 2019 electric car said to get 300 miles on a 15-minute charge,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/26/volkswagens-2019-electric-car-said-to-get-300-miles-on-a-15-minute-charge/,2016/08/26,"
This year’s Paris motor show will host the unveiling of Volkswagen’s first all-electric car, according to an interview with company chairman Herbert Diess in German magazine WirstschaftWoche. The car will be roughly Golf-sized, according to the chairman, but will feel as roomy as a Passat on the inside, thanks to space saved via lighter frame construction and use of the electric drivetrain. It’s on track for a launch in late 2018 or early 2019, which is in keeping with their earlier stated goal of delivering a range of EVs by 2020.
The highlight feature of this car might be the charging speed, however, which Autocar says will give it 300 miles of travel on just one, 15-minute charge. Even for electric vehicles with big batteries and lots of range, recharging time has been the key sticking point – Tesla’s supercharger stations will achieve an 80 percent charge in around 45 minutes, for instance.
A 15-minute time for 300 miles of range would be very impressive in a production vehicle. VW-owned Porsche claimed an 80 percent charge in 15 minutes for its Mission E Concept, unveiled last year, with a max range on a full charge of 310 miles. That speed requires an 800 volt charging rate, which is something Porsche is actively looking to build into charging infrastructure.
It’s unlikely that a 2019 VW all-electric will be able to take advantage of this kind of charging tech widely, given the charging infrastructure changed required, but it would still be a big statement from the car-maker to offer the spec in a shipping car. And since the Volkswagen group is still reeling from its emission scandal, any sizeable steps it can take in the EV market will ultimately do a lot to hep it recover its reputation.
In addition to the speedy charging capability, VW also says they’re aiming to field a vehicle that actually costs less than traditional fuel-burning cars. Volkswagen has electric versions of the Golf and Up, but this forthcoming car will be its first dedicated electric model.

944,Spiri’s on-demand carpooling service will use custom EVs and let drivers ride free,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/26/spiris-on-demand-carpooling-service-will-use-custom-evs-and-let-drivers-ride-free/,2016/08/26,"
Danish startup Spiri believes urban transportation is still massively inefficient, and it’s setting out to tackle the problem from a few different directions. First, it’s building an on-demand carpooling service, similar to the UberPOOL offering. Second, it’s going to use its own custom electric vehicles to do so. Finally, it’s using customers as drivers, in exchange for free rides. Service is currently set to begin in 2017.
Basically, that means the approach is a hybrid one that borrows aspects of what car sharing networks like car2go have done, with the on-demand taxi-style approach. The deal for drivers is that they can use Spiri’s fleet of cars free, provided they agree to pick up some passengers along the way and drop them off en-route to their destination. Passengers foot the cost of operation, paying what Spiri says will be costs in line with “public transport prices.” It’s working with Drivr, a dispatch and ridesharing platform provider, for the software side of the service.
Spiri’s most interesting aspect might be that it’s using its own cars. The vehicles are described as “ultra-light electric” ones. They’ll be multi-seaters, and the company claims 50 percent more energy efficiency as compared to the majority of electric cars on the road again, thanks to its use of lightweight materials. It’ll also boast “more legroom than a Mercedes S class limousine,” according to board member Peter Carlsson in a press release, who previously acted as Tesla’s VP of supply chain.
Exactly what said car will look like isn’t public, yet. When asked for further information, Spiri told me that the vehicle design “is all electric and bespoke built for city transport. This means it’s ultra lightweight. It’s sheds all excess car bling bling resulting in using only 25% parts of a normal car.” The entire thing has been designed in-house, Spiri says, as the startup “has been in stealth for more than year with engineers from Tesla, Aston Martin, BMW, DriveNow, Rimac and a lot more” working on the car.
Spiri tells me that hitting the roads with driver-controlled cars in 2017 is just step one, and step two will be putting self-driving Spiri prototype vehicles into testing later that same year.
The first glimpse of the car will be revealed at TechBBQ, a Danish tech conference happening September 20. Until then, people interested in signing up for the service can register today at Spiri.io. We’ll be sure to check out the final design of their vehicle, which based on the teaser does look interesting (panorama roof in a short-bodied frame?).

945,2017 Audi A4 driver assistance review,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/25/2017-audi-a4-driver-assistance/,2016/08/25," 



The 2017 Audi A4 has an all-new suite of advanced driver assistance systems, joining Volvo, Honda, Ford and others in making semi-autonomous safety features available in cars we can buy today.
Activating the adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping systems isn’t intuitive; there’s a second stalk under the turn signal stalk where the driver can control these features. But once they’re on, all the most important information is displayed in the full-color heads-up display. Most HUDs show the speed, but the A4 also shows the speed limit (and if it’s a school zone), the lane-keeping assist guidelines and the adaptive cruise control (ACC) and traffic jam assist activity — and even a little shoe to warn you when your foot is too heavy on the gas pedal.

The ACC works best if you can set it to the speed limit and then let the sensors take care of acceleration and deceleration, all the way to 0 mph. In traffic, the display shows several little green car figures, and the ACC can be restarted by pressing on the accelerator for a second. A little lever on the ACC stalk lets you adjust your following distance.
The A4’s lane-keeping assist works as well as any other I’ve tried, which means it’s mostly okay. It can wander a bit in the lane, which always makes me wonder if people think I’m tipsy or just a terrible driver. It seems that the A4 can quickly recognize when it’s not doing a very good job, and will chime and give a text warning that the driver needs to take control of the steering.

Investment opportunities in the autonomous vehicle space
What will a driverless future actually look like?




Connected, autonomous vehicles are around the corner. Many of the most innovative and deep-pocketed companies in the world are racing to bring them to market — and for good reason: the economic and social gains they will generate will be tremendous.
But any transformative technology creates new challenges and risks in addition to benefits. This is no exception.
One of the biggest threats that society will face as transportation transforms in the coming years is vehicle cybersecurity. It is a topic about which much is still unknown, even among those working at the cutting edge of the industry; vehicle connectivity is a new phenomenon and the technology continues to evolve rapidly.
Thankfully, a major malicious cyberattack on a vehicle has yet to take place. But the potential danger was illustrated dramatically last year when two white-hat hackers remotely took control of a Jeep Cherokee and cut its transmission on the highway as part of a research initiative. The well-publicized incident prompted Chrysler to recall 1.4 million vehicles.
One of the central challenges in vehicle cybersecurity is that the various electrical components in a car (known as electronic control units, or ECUs) are connected via an internal network. Thus, if hackers manage to gain access to a vulnerable, peripheral ECU — for instance, a car’s Bluetooth or infotainment system — from there they may be able to take control of safety critical ECUs like its brakes or engine and wreak havoc.
Cars today have up to 100 ECUs and more than 100 million lines of code — a massive attack surface. Further complicating matters, auto manufacturers source ECUs from many different suppliers, meaning that no one player is in control of, or even familiar with, all of a vehicle’s source code.
The threat of automotive cyberattacks will only loom larger as society transitions to autonomous vehicles. But even before autonomous vehicles become widespread, car hacking is already a very real danger: In 2014, more than half of the vehicles sold in the United States were connected, meaning that they are vulnerable to cyberattacks.
Drivers shouldn’t have to choose between being connected and being protected.— Senator Edward J. Markey
Key players in the auto industry have begun to pay attention.
“A cyber incident is a problem for every automaker in the world,” General Motors CEO Mary Barra said in a recent speech. “It is a matter of public safety.”
Given the stakes, it is no surprise that this area has attracted a flurry of recent startup and investment activity. Argus Cyber Security, the largest and most established of these startups, raised $26 million in Series B funding last fall. Earlier this year, Harman acquired cybersecurity startup TowerSec for $72.5 million. In April, Israel-based Karamba Security raised $2.5 million in seed funding.
How auto cybersecurity works
We spoke with Argus executive Yoni Heilbronn about the details and challenges of auto cybersecurity.
“The best mental model for understanding how automotive cybersecurity solutions work is to envision them as having several layers of defense,” Heilbronn said. “Multiple solutions focused on different parts of the connected car ecosystem must be integrated in order to provide comprehensive, end-to-end protection; a single product alone is not adequate.”
Starting at the foundation, defensive software solutions can be housed locally on individual ECUs — for instance, a car’s brakes — to reinforce these ECUs against attacks. Moving up a level, software can protect the vehicle’s internal network as a whole by examining all network communications, flagging any changes in standard in-vehicle network behavior and stopping attacks from advancing in the network.
Next, solutions exist to defend the particular electronic units in a vehicle that are connected to the outside world — for instance, infotainment units. This is a critical layer in the overall cybersecurity defense system, because it represents the border between the vehicle’s internal network and the external world.
Many observers believe that private industry has so far not taken the threat seriously or invested enough to proactively address it. 
Finally, cloud security services can detect and correct threats before they reach the vehicle. They also can send the vehicle over-the-air updates and intelligence in real time.
In addition to these layers of protection directly relating to a vehicle’s connectivity, supply chain risk management is a critical element of the overall cybersecurity effort. Compromised physical components can jeopardize the integrity of a car’s security architecture, making it imperative that OEMs only source parts from trusted suppliers.
The government’s role
Given the public safety implications, this topic has begun to receive much attention from U.S. lawmakers. In July 2015, Senators Markey (D-Mass.) and Blumenthal (D-Conn.) proposed legislation to establish mandatory federal standards for auto cybersecurity.
“Drivers shouldn’t have to choose between being connected and being protected,” said Markey. “We need clear rules of the road that protect cars from hackers.”
Not everyone on Capitol Hill agrees, however. Senator Gary Peters (D-Mich.) has argued that regulators should adopt a more hands-off stance and allow private industry to take the lead in formulating solutions and setting standards.
Arguing that there is “a knowledge gap” among lawmakers on auto cybersecurity, Peters stated, “The way to prevent Congress from [imposing more regulation] is for the industry to step up. The technology is moving so fast that the problem will be the regulators not being able to keep up.”
Society is often reactive rather than proactive with security issues, adopting serious preventive measures only after a major incident has occurred.
Many observers believe that private industry has so far not taken the threat seriously or invested enough to proactively address it. This may, however, be changing.
A number of OEMs, including Tesla, Fiat Chrysler and GM, have recently established “bug bounty” programs to reward individuals that find and report security flaws in their cars’ software, an effort to further fortify their systems against vulnerabilities.
More significantly, the Auto-ISAC, an industry group of major auto manufacturers and suppliers, recently released a comprehensive set of best practices for automotive cybersecurity. The automakers plan for these guidelines to serve as the foundation for industry-wide cybersecurity standards; they likely also hope that taking the lead here will dissuade policymakers from intervening with stringent regulatory requirements.

The road ahead
There are more unknowns than knowns when it comes to the imminence and severity of automotive cyberattacks. Because a major malicious attack has yet to take place, it is hard to know exactly who is most likely to perpetrate such an attack, how it might happen and how much damage it might cause.

Society is often reactive rather than proactive with security issues, adopting serious preventive measures only after a major incident has occurred. Hopefully that pattern will not be repeated here. The good news is that automakers, startups and government regulators are all beginning to focus on the issue and take action to address it.
“A major auto cybersecurity event could happen tomorrow,” Argus executive Heilbronn said. “We all collectively need to come to grips with this. The hacking capabilities are out there right now. The vulnerabilities are out there right now. I do think that attacks will begin to take place unless we take this threat more seriously.”

947,MIT spinout NuTonomy just beat Uber to launch the world’s first self-driving taxi,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/24/mit-spinout-nutonomy-just-beat-uber-to-launch-the-worlds-first-self-driving-taxi/,2016/08/24,"
Uber has taken the plaudits for its audacious plan to deploy driverless cars as soon as this month, but the U.S. giant has been beaten to the punch for actually introducing autonomous vehicles by a far lower-profile company that is working on the other side of the world in Singapore.
NuTonomy, a three-year-old company that span out of MIT, announced that its first autonomous vehicles available for public hire have hit the roads of the Southeast Asian country today.
The name may not be familiar, but this development hasn’t come out of the blue. Cambridge, MA-based NuTonomy has been working with authorities in Singapore for some time as part of the country’s focus on surfacing new technology. Indeed, the Singapore Economic Development Board itself was one of a number of high-profile backers to take part in NuTonomy’s $16 million Series A financing round in May this year.
As we wrote then, the company plans to introduce a fully-autonomous “robo” taxi service by 2018. Today’s announcement is a major step towards that goal, but NuTonomy has been privately testing self-driving cars in Singapore since April. It is also conducting trials in London and Michigan, and counts Jaguar Land Rover among its partners.
Singapore is the real test bed thanks to the support of authorities in the country, who are switched on by the potential to embrace technology to reduce congestion and cars ownership.

The public trial is a world-first, but it is starting in a small, controlled environment.
Customers can use NuTonomy’s app to summon a ride for free, but it is limiting availability to a 2.5km square business district area in Singapore — “One North” — with just a handful of cars, all of which are a Renault Zoe or a Mitsubishi i-MiEV.
Like Uber, the setup does require some human presence. Each car will include a NuTonomy engineer who will “observe system performance and assume control if needed to ensure passenger comfort and safety.”
The trials are likely to be hugely impacting for NuTonomy with the data captured from public rides going towards hitting that target of a fully self-driving car fleet by 2018.
Uber CEO Travis Kalanick refused to be drawn on timeframes for when Uber will expand its self-driving car push. That’s where NuTonomy has a huge advantage in Singapore, a country that is just 720 km square with a government that pushes technology through a smart city program which includes open data, APIs and more.
“NuTonomy’s first-in-the-world public trial is a direct reflection of the level of maturity that we have achieved with our AV software system. The trial represents an extraordinary opportunity to collect feedback from riders in a real-world setting, and this feedback will give NuTonomy a unique advantage as we work toward deployment of a self-driving vehicle fleet in 2018,” NuTonomy CEO and co-founder Karl Iagnemma said in a statement.
To speed its development, Uber snapped up self-driving tech startup Otto in a rare acquisition that could be worth as much as $600 million. Given that Otto only launched publicly in May, that’s a pretty quick and enthusiastic pick-up from Uber, to say the least. It makes you wonder if Kalanick and co made efforts to acquire NuTonomy, given that knowledge of its technology has been in the public domain for some time and it has clearly made progress, too.

949,The 48 startups that launched at Y Combinator S16 Demo Day 2,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/23/yc-demo-day/,2016/08/23,"
The world’s most prestigious startup school launched 48 companies today at part 2 of its Summer 2016 Demo Day. Nanoparticle analytics and delivery robots were amongst the products revealed in the B2B, biotech, enterprise, edtech, fintech, and hardware verticals. You can check out our write-ups of all 44 startups that launched yesterday, and TechCrunch’s picks for the top 7 from the first half of the batch. Here are our picks for the top 8 from today’s set, with all of them below.
YC International
Trying to distill trends from the hodgepodge of startups at Demo day can be futile, because the real winners are the ones ahead of the trends. For example, TechCrunch thought Airware’s drone operating system was a little too early in 2013. It turned out to be smartly ahead of the curve. Now you see lots of drone startups in YC, but many are chasing Airware which has gone on to raise $70 million.
Justin Kan, Twitch co-founder and YC partner
Y Combinator president Sam Altman explains “The best company at any given Demo Day is not the one that fits the theme of that Demo Day. it’s the one that fits the theme of 2019.” Altman cites the Alan Kay quote that “the best way to predict the future is to invent it”, adding “I think short of that, the future is basically unknowable. What I like about YC is the companies get to invent the future. They don’t have to guess.”
One important development is that 30% of this batch’s companies were founded outside the US, a bigger portion than in the past.
YC partner Justin Kan credits that to the program being around long enough that it’s funded successful companies from tons of countries. He says founders used to ask “Would YC even fund a company from Indonesia or Thailand?” but now there are role models they can look to.
“The startup mindset has seeped out of the Silicon Valley” Altman tells us. “One of the things that will surprise people is how much of a world-wide phenomenon startups will become.” Altman notes that while tech has led to four of the five most valuable companies in the world being based on the west coast of the US, he doesn’t expect that to persist, so YC has to fund international startups.
And now, here are all 48 companies that launched at YC Summer 2016 Demo Day 2:
ApolloShield – A system to safely land threatening drones 
Drones present a serious threat to security. Every year, there are thousands of security incidents with drones that can include contraband delivery and near collisions with aircraft. ApolloShield is selling a device that can take control of unwanted drones, disconnect operators, and safely land the crafts. To date, the hardware can defend against about half the drones on the market. The company said that law enforcement clients need an average of five devices that cost $30,000 per device per year.

Ohmygreen – B2B wellness solutions
Who knew there’s already a billion dollar-plus market for office snacks? That’s what Ohmygreen — a provider of healthy office snacks — is going after. The company already serves larger companies like Lyft and Amazon, and boasts a 55 percent gross margin. The company has an $800,000 monthly recurring revenue, too. Ohmygreen does 700 deliveries every month, but at its core, it’s a logistics company, CEO Michael Heinrich said. That makes plenty sense — it allows Ohmygreen to optimize its delivery network and supply chains for its specific kinds of snacks. “This allows us to get those gross margins, 55 percent is 3-5X that of industry leaders,” he said. “That’s the same as Twilio.”

 
Emote – Student behavioral analysis
Student outcomes are as much a product of learning as they are a product of wellness. Emote wants to put powerful behavioral information in the hands of teachers before students even walk into the classroom. The company recognizes that 300,000 students are pushed out of class every single day and wants to do something about it by helping teachers recognize and plan for student interactions so that disruptions don’t occur. Emote will be in 33 schools by the end of September and another 135 by January. This represents 1.3 million in potential revenue and the company cites sales cycles of just three weeks.

 
Flutterwave – Payment processing in Africa
Payments processing is stratified across Africa. The continent is host to over 276 wallets, 500 banks, and 7 card networks. Flutterwave is producing an API for payment processing that can organize this market and create efficiencies. The company has already processed $20 million in payments over the last three months and stands to gain a lot from a 0.3 percent processing fee. In the last month, Flutterwave doubled its payment volume in an African market of over $360 billion yearly mobile payments. Services are available in Nigeria and Ghana and will be expanding to nine more countries by the end of the year.

 
Instrumentl – Making scientific grants easy
For scientists, applying to grants is a drag. It just doesn’t make sense for some of the most educated people on the planet to spend their time filling out forms and searching for funding sources. Instrumentl offers universities and research institutions access to a database of federal, state, and corporate money — for a monthly fee of $35 per seat. But Instrumentl isn’t just a database, it leverages machine learning algorithms to identify and push relevant grants towards applicable research. Scientists simply use the platform to build a project description and the platform takes care of the rest. Harvard, Yale, and Texas A&M are already using the platform and the company is generating 200,000 in annual recurring revenue.

 
People.ai – Sales team analytics  
Oleg Rogynskyy and his team at People.ai want to help companies understand what sales teams are doing on a daily basis. People.ai integrates with calendars, phones, and emails and logs sales activity that leads to closing deals. The idea is that sales teams can track best practices from top performers and close more deals. Over 100 companies have partnered with people.ai over the last four months at a price of $50 per seat per month.

Revlo – Audience management for gamers that live stream
Live streaming video gaming sessions may seem like a dream job, but it can be a lot of work to engage with interested viewers. Revlo is an audience management platform for streamers. Early users have seen a 40 percent increase in viewership time and a 2X increase in new viewer retention. Today there are 16,000 active streamers on the platform, paying $10 per month, to use its chatbots, leaderboards, and virtual currency to increase engagement.

 
Quero Education – Filling open seats at Brazilian colleges
Quero Education is an ed-tech startup out of Brazil that is promising to help solve under-enrollment issues at Brazilian universities. Contrary to what most of us would think, coming from schools challenged daily by a lack of professors and dormitories, enrollment at Brazilian schools would need to double to just match the number of available seats. The company’s platform offers information across colleges in additions to discounts at over a third of schools in Brazil. Quero takes a 12 percent cut of tuition which averages $3,000 per year in the country and has generated $7 million in revenue at a 5X yearly growth rate.

Fellow – An API for working capital 
Many companies struggle to find working capital when it is most needed — the end of the month when employees and contracts need to be paid. Fellow is an API for invoice financing that removes friction for companies. The API auto-underwrites and finances invoices. In three weeks, four companies have started using Fellow, financing approximately $120,000 in working capital. In the past, companies had to either have huge revenue streams, or deal with months of bureaucracy to get credit lines from banks.

 
HiOperator – Customer service as a service
HiOperator wants to help companies get access to customer service, no matter their size. The company scales phone, email and chat support services with easy integrations and a pay-as-you-go model that contrasts with other services that have large on-boarding fees. Ten companies are already using HiOperator, resulting in $11,000 in monthly recurring revenue. HiOperator’s services can integrate into key customer service platforms and centralize all information into a single platform.

 
 
 
Innov8 – Coworking spaces for India
Innov8 wants to bring coworking to India in a big way. They group has already built two centers in the country with 100 percent occupancy and a 200 person waitlist. The spaces utilize differentiating design to convince a growing number entrepreneurs in India to pay the monthly fee. Coworking is burgeoning in India because of it offers reliable infrastructure while at the same time reducing costs. Innov8 charges occupants $150 a month, which represents an average of about a 50 percent reduction of office costs.

 
Vidcode – Teaching CS with fun student projects  
Online services like CodeAcademy have been growing for a few years, but Vidcode wants to target students directly in their schools by providing projects adapted for a younger audience. Vidcode partnered with Snapchat to let students build and implement filters. Students can also use Java to build Pokemon and memes from scratch. The company is currently working to expand a high-profile contract with New York City Schools. Since launching, Vidcode is growing at 40 percent monthly by charging districts and schools $50 per student using the platform.

Polymail – Office mail without plugins 
Today, our email productivity is more dependent on plugins then the mail client itself. We use them for read receipts, for scheduling, and for contact management.  Polymail wants to integrate all of these features into a core email service. The company is focusing its efforts on businesses that predominately use email services like Outlook to manage their communication. The well designed service already has 7,300 daily active users and 2,000 companies putting it through the paces. Taking a page from Slack, the service is free to teams for now and will be monetized with upgrades, including additional CRM features.

 
Vetcove – Supplies for veterinary clinics 
Every week, veterinary hospitals have to purchase supplies from dozens of vendors. Amazon has been aggregating products online for over 20 years, but Vetcove wants to make sure that the veterinary supplies market is not ignored. By forging partnerships with vendors, Vetcove hopes to increase its returns. Having spent their lives working in the space, the team has leveraged connections to bring 1600 veterinary hospitals onto the platform in the last year, representing 7 percent of all the veterinary hospitals in the entire United States. From this large customer base, Vetcove saw $860,000 in purchases last week.

 
Whyd – Voice controlled speakers
Music technology today is highly compartmentalized. We have Spotify to play our music, phones and computers to store it, bluetooth to stream it, and Alexia to talk to it. Companies like Sonos have brought audio technology forward to the doorstep of the streaming generation, but Whyd wants to go even further by integrating voice control into the speaker itself. The company is working with companies that make products for audio mainstays like JBL and Harman Kardon. This week alone, consumers have purchased 50,000 worth of the speakers.

Meesho – Helping Indian businesses sell with social 
Commerce in India is largely driven by mobile interactions over platforms like WeChat. Over 50 million small businesses sell over WeChat in the country. Meesho is an e-commerce platform for small businesses in India adapted for platforms like WeChat. Shop owners can interact directly with potential buyers. Businesses that use Meesho have seen a 30 percent increase in sales within a month of starting use. The company not only wants to jump on trends of mobile communication in commerce, but the overall trend of small businesses in India moving to digital platforms to manage sales. India is expected to see 10X growth over the next four years in this space.

RoseRocket – Collaborative trucking platform
RoseRocket is helping trucking companies work with other trucking companies. The team recognized that most technology platforms servicing the trucking industry created tools under the assumption that trucking companies were in competition with other carriers. In reality, companies collaborate daily and most shipments spend time on other carriers trucks. At any given time, three million trucks are on the road, and 50 percent of orders are outsourced at some point during their transportation. The software costs trucking companies $10,000 per month. In addition to subscription revenue, RoseRocket also makes approximately $50,000 in commissions from each trucking company for facilitating connections.

 
Proxy – Enabling phones to become access cards
Mobile payments and even coupons have come to our smartphones, yet we still carry building access cards with us to work. Proxy is working to replace RFID cards with smartphones. They have created a sensor for doors that connects to phones. The readers work seamlessly with smartphones and do not require any application to be open when entering a building. Besides being convenient for workers, the readers collect valuable data on the number of workers in an office at any given time and the amount of time they spend there.

Seneca Systems – Local government software
Local governments use outdated phones, spreadsheets, and email to organize spending of over $1.1 trillion per year in the US on trash pickup, police dispatch, traffic lights, and more. Seneca System offers a software system that ties all departments of a local government together so they can sensibly respond to requests from citizens and each other. Seneca Systems already has big cities like Houston, Chicago, San Jose, and Boston paying for its $60 per employee SaaS, with 100 percent month over month growth in monthly recurring revenue. There are 10.5 million total local gov employees in the US, and 47 west coast cities in Seneca Systems’ pipeline already, meaning Seneca Systems is chasing an enormous market. If it can lock down the foundation of management infrastructure for local govs, it could expand into more IT services.

 
Legalist — Algorithmic litigation financing
There’s a new asset class for investors — and it’s actually in litigation, where investors help cover the cost of litigation in exchange for a share of the outcome. By 2016, it’s become a $3 billion market, Legalist CEO Eva Sheng said. That’s where Legalist, an algorithmic risk assessment startup, enters. Legalist gathers data from cases dating back to 1989 to figure out the risk and case duration for a specific case, gauging 58 variable correlated with case outcome. It’s basically quantitative analysis for case outcomes, though it’s “not Peter Thiel funding Hulk Hogan,” Sheng said. The firm has already invested in one case for $75,00, with an expected outcome of $1 million, Sheng said.

CoinTent – Recover revenue lost to ad blockers
Web publishers lost $22 million last year from having their ads blocked. 22 percent of US users have ad blockers, and usage is growing 50 percent per year. CoinTent helps publishers detect users with ad blockers, and either deny them access or let them pay $1 for ad-free access. CoinTent recovers an average of 25 percent of lost revenue, and takes a 30 percent cut of what it recovers. Eventually it wants to build a cross-web subscription service for ad-free browsing. With ad blocking rapidly growing, publishers need a solution, and CoinTent could build it for them.

 
Amberbox — Safety sensors for  shooter detection
Fire alarms are everywhere, but there’s a lot of opportunity to go beyond that, James Popper says. That’s the goal of Amberbox, which is to not only detect fires, but also active shooters with gunshot detection. Going after just the existing market alone, it’s a $26 billion market, but Amberbox is going for a new subscription-style model. The devices network with each other in order to create a large system that can notify authorities and managers quickly and help them lock down entire campuses. The devices cost $50 per month, or around $1,250 per three-story building, Popper said, and the devices break even after around 3 months of revenue.

 
Robby – Self-driving delivery robots
There 12 billion food and package delivers in the US every year. But the on-demand meal and grocery industries are being held back by the high costs of human deliverers. Robby makes self-driving delivery robots that can autonomously navigate sidewalks to your door. Robby can reduce costs of deliveries from $5 to $10, to $1 to $2 each. Its MIT PhD-built bots have already made 50 deliveries, and Robby about to start a pilot program with Instacart. If Robby can make deliveries cheaper for the consumer, it could unlock enormous growth for the on-demand economy.

 
Eventgeek — ROI and logistics tracking for events
Nearly every company is going to throw an event at some point. Whether it’s for employees in order to increase retention to throwing conferences in order to attract new customers, it’s a huge expense for companies. And the outcome isn’t always obvious, because there hasn’t been a strong set of tools to manage the direct outcome of those events. That’s what Eventgeek is hoping to do, plugging into multiple channels like Salesforce or Twitter to track new followers ro sales leads. The company charges around $10,000 per year, which with a market of around 250,000 companies represents a $2.5B opportunity, CEO Alex Patriquin said. The company is growing 48 percent month-over-month.

 
RocketLit – Adaptive learning platform
66 percent of US 8th graders have a reading difficulty level below their grade level. That means they can’t read their textbooks to study, so they fall behind. RocketLit re-writes textbooks at seven different reading levels and serves students the appropriate version. In a pilot, low performing students scored 90 percent on their science exams and every student went up two reading levels in a single year. RocketLit has $1 million in pilots set up, and is hoping to disrupt the $14 billion textbook market. If everything online adapts to the user, so should education.

 
Jumpcut — Online courses that look and feel like movies
Last year, LinkedIn spent $1.5 billion on Lynda.com, an online learning platform. Online education itself has become a huge market. But the course completion rates and retention is far too low, according to Jumpcut CEO Kong Pham — because the lectures are simply too boring. He’s hoping that his team can build a company based around “Spielberg-like” online courses, starting with professional networking videos like learning how to network and become better at social media. The company has $85,000 in monthly recurring revenue and is doubling month-over-month with a $17-per-month subscription model. It’s going to be challenging for sure: it’s going to be hard to figure out how to make highly cinematic videos that go into tough subjects like computer science and mathematics. But Pham and his team — which have previously built a company in viral video — hope they can crack that market.

 
CrowdAI – Smarter image recognition 
Companies send CrowdAI photos, and the startup tells clients exactly what’s in them. It can recognize farm land, factories, oil rigs, and much more. One company uses it to detect the number of shipping containers in satellite photos of ports, and sells that data to hedge funds. Big companies pay a fortune for accurate human tagging, while small companies rely on computers that can be inaccurate. CrowdAI blends humans and machine image scanning to accurately and cheaply provide image recognition. It’s already working with Planet Labs and self-driving car company Cruise. With a team of technical co-founders, CrowdAI could grow to help industries like medical imaging and the military too.

 
OneChronos — Next generation financial exchange
Trading on the stock market has become an arms race to build the fastest smartest algorithms. OneChronos hopes to level that playing field by bringing new trading mechanisms to online trading that reduce that arms race down to a more sane transaction system. The company syncs up atomic clocks to eliminate the need to race over a network, and building tools to help traders move more volume at a fair price. And it’s also letting customers run code directly inside the exchange in an additional effort to reduce cost for financial firms. CEO Kelly Littlepage says that it has signed 6 letters of intent — a $7 million revenue potential — but it has quite a few hurdles before launching next year, including filing with the SEC. But the hope is that, if all goes well, OneChronos will be a new, next-generation NASDAQ exchange.

 
Validere – Handheld industrial testing equipment 
Oil, gas, and chemical companies have to send samples to a slow, expensive lab to test their materials. Validere makes a handheld device that can give results cheaper, faster, and without trained technicians. At $50 per test, Validere is 5x cheaper than labs because it uses liquid property indicators combined with computer vision algorithms and public databases of chemical properties. Validere already has $750,000 in paid pilot programs, and it’s aiming at a $22 billion industry. The startup’s team PhDs from Havard and other elite schools is solving the problem not just by shrinking lab equipment, but making it easy enough for any truck driver to use.

 
OOHLALA — mobile OS for colleges
It can be hard to keep track of everything that’s going on at a campus, whether that’s messaging between new student acquaintances that might have each others phone numbers or paying for school resources. OOHLALA is hoping to build a complete resource for all those tools for students with what Daniel Jameel, CEO of the company, says is a “mobile OS for the school.” That may sound pretty broad, but it sounds like colleges are starting to apply it: the company has around $1.5 million in annual recurring revenue and tripled in size year over year. The company charges $50,000 across a total addressable market of 60,000 schools — or a $3B potential market. The company has 150 paying colleges in 7 countries, Jameel said.

 
Opsolutely – Automated deployments for software teams 
Developers use GitHub for writing code, AWS for servers, and New Relic for monitoring, but they need something to manage how their code is deployed. Opsolutely lets them granularly push code to their infrastructure with dedicated software, instead of using expensive, custom, error-prone in-house scripts or Heroku. Opsolutely already counts GitHub and Eero as paying customers for its $100 per web service per month tier. With some companies running hundreds or thousands of internal web services, Opsolutely is entering a $3 billion market

 
Livement — Tickets and concessions for sports stadiums
In Latin America, the ticketing process is even more of a pain than dealing with Ticketmaster and other ticketing services. In fact, customers sometimes even have to go to stores to pick up paper tickets that they purchase through Ticketmaster, Livement CEO Roberto Novelo said. Livement hopes to fix that by allowing people to not only purchase tickets online, but also purchase concessions within stadiums through an app. The company charges a 7 percent transaction fee plus a 25 cent charge for tickets, and Novelo said the company booked $500,000 in gross ticket sales in a month. Right now the company has signed with 6 teams, and is starting off in Latin America to start off given the pain points that exist there.

 
SmartPath – Financial advisor for main street families
While the wealthy top 15 percent have traditional and robo advisors to help them with finances, 100 million main street US families go unserved. SmartPath helps families track their expenses, complete online training, and earn rewards. Right now, they could score gift cards for getting smarter about money, but eventually Smartpath wants to get them lower interest rates on their loans. Though it sounds boring, 67 percent of users keep at it, and it’s growing 30 percent month over month. SmartPath charges employers $1 to $5 per employee per month. It targets them because companies already spend $800 million on financial wellness since it makes employees more stable and productive.

PatientBank — Platform for gathering and sharing medical data
Would you pay $30 to get your medical records before your next doctor visit? That’s what PatientBank is hoping, given that the traditional process of getting records might involve actually physically visiting an office or ordering them over the phone. With that model, PatientBank has already gathered more than 10,000 records from 2,300 hospitals to date, and generates around $4,000 in weekly revenue in its two months of operations. Given that there are more than a billion doctor visits every year, it’s increasingly important to have an all-in-one place for medical records, but it’s been a huge challenge to move records from one health professional to another. PatientBank seems to take a more patient-centric approach, and we’ll have to see if that model pans out to be a good financial model.
 
Saleswhale – Coaching bot for sales teams in Asia
Sales reps are bad at personalizing emails or contacting the right decision maker, leading to an average email response rate of under 3 percent. Saleswhale analyzes a company’s emails and makes actionable recommendations about how to improve. One pilot saw it raise a company’s response rates from 6 percent to 31 percent. Saleswhale is already working with huge companies in Asia like Grab, charging $75 per rep per month. For now it’s focusing on Asia, where it says sales tech is five years behind the US. There are legions of sales people out there, and Saleswhale could make them smarter instantly.

Selfycart — Mobile app for self-checkout
Checking out is one of the most complicated parts of the shopping experience. Self-checkout kiosks can be painful to work with, and the alternative is hiring someone just to handle the process — and that’s all there’s ever been. Selfycart is launching in order to add a third one: checking out on your phone. It’s basically just an app where users scan products and pay for them through the app. Selfycart charges 2 percent to retailers per transaction, instead of the retailers having to pay for large checkout operations. Instead of kiosks, retailers only need a sales associate to validate transactions. Selfycart customers can use Apple Pay, credit cards and PayPal for their transactions.

Lendsnap – Automating mortgage paperwork for lenders
It can take up to 500 pages of documents to apply for a loan, leading 80 percent of people to go with the first lender they find so they don’t get the best price. Lendsnap helps compile the 30 different documents from a loan buyer’s online accounts, from bank statements to W2s. By charging $100 per loan, Lendsnap can chase a $1.8 billion opportunity. Eventually, it wants to pre-compile people’s documents to create a loan marketplace. Loans are already scary enough, Lendsnap could at least make them easy.

 
BulldozAIR — Task management software for construction projects
Tracking construction issues can be difficult across a large number of construction sites. BulldozAIR wants to build a whole suite of tools that use mobile devices to keep track of all the tasks construction workers complete visually. Workers take photos of things like wiring issues, for example, and explain the technical components in the app. That information is then shared across the entire network, which BulldozAIR charges $290 per worker per year. That’s enabled BulldozAIR to generate $20,000 in recurring revenue this month, and targeting $36,000 monthly recurring revenue next month. The company is targeting Europe for now, but that alone represents a $3.7B market, CEO Ali El Hariri said.

 
Nova Credit — Global credit reports
One of the most important parts of economic health is the ability to make purchases with credit and debt. But for immigrants in the U.S., they might not have access to credit because they simply have no credit history in the States. Nova Credit is looking to bridge the gap between the credit history immigrants have internationally with creditors in the U.S., giving them a set of data to make a call as to whether to issue a line of credit. Those scores are equally important when it comes to renting apartments or taking out loans, too. Each credit pull costs lenders $30, and with 10 million immigrants in the U.S., that already addresses a multi-billion dollar market, CEO Misha Esipov said. In the next two months, the company will link to firms in India, Canada and Germany, and expects to cover 90 percent of the immigrant base in the U.S. in a year.

NeoWize – Personalization for ecommerce
Most e-commerce sites just show the newest, cheapest, or best selling items first. NeoWize analyzes browsing behavior like clicks, hovers, and scroll-bys to instantly personalize the items people see. Pilot customers saw a 10 percent to 30 percent increase in store revenue. Now NeoWize is built into AbanteCart and is targeting other ecommerce platforms instead of individual stores to quickly scale out. It’s growing 70 percent week over week, and is now in 1300 active stores. If you don’t personalize your site, people will bounce, so NeoWize shows them what they’ll actually want.

 
YesGraph — Social graph API that helps apps grow
When you’re inviting a friend to try out a new product, the process is probably pretty clunky — you have to dig up the right contact, and for the app makers, it’s not as likely that they’ll get a high quality user. Ivan Kirigin, who ran growth at Dropbox for two years, is hoping to apply machine learning to a person’s private social graph (including their contacts and emails) in order to recommend the best people to invite to a new app or product. Starting off with business-to-business customers, YesGraph will rank invites by company email domain, job titles, location, and a number of other data points. And the more data about a person’s social graph and behavior YesGraph collects (privately), the better the targeting gets across all kinds of data points, making the results more and more accurate for other companies’ invite flows.

TL Biolabs — Genomic predictions for better livestock management.
If farmers have an opportunity to predict what’s going to happen to cattle as soon as they’re born — whether they’ll be susceptible to disease or need less feed — they can plan accordingly. But testing for those kinds of parameters can cost up to $100, TL Biolabs CEO Fred Turner said, coming from companies like illumina and eating up potential profits. TL Biolabs is trying to build a cheaper test — it costs $15 — using proprietary technology to get those kinds of predictions. By doing that, Farmers can optimize their operations in order to get the best possible outcome from their cattle. The company is currently running a pilot with the Scottish government to test 20 percent of the cattle born this year, which is a $1 million pilot, Turner said.

Sway – Automated bookkeeping
Companies spend $61 billion a year on human bookkeeping, but computers can do it better, faster, and cheaper. Sway has built an automated bookkeeping tool that connect to online accounts like Stripe, PayPal, and other infrastructure to pull the data it needs. Instead of a person spending 10 hours punching that data into spreadsheets manually, Sway can do it in 10 minutes. At $99 per month, Sway wants to replace bookkeeping for 500,000 businesses. This job won’t exist in 10 years, and Sway wants to accelerate the change.

 
Elemeno Health – Checklists for hospitals
Medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the US, and that’s partly due to inconsistency of care. Doctors and nurses forgot to check everything. Elemeno Health compiles best practices for hospitals into a checklist tool that ensures caregivers aren’t missing anything. Its pilot with UCSF saved three lives, over 300 hospital days of work, and $1.1 million. Elemeno’s co-founder worked on the frontlines of hospitals to gather the knowledge, and now he wants to bring those surefire processes to every doctor and nurse.

 
UtilityScore — API for Utility Data
When shopping for a home, there’s always going to be a huge cost that goes along with the mortgage: the utility bill. But that might be hard to estimate, especially when digging through potential homes on Zillow or other sites. UtilityScore is building a back-end tool that allows those companies to call up estimates for all 82 million single family homes for utility costs, giving potential home buyers more information when deciding whether or not to make a purchase. That information comes from a collection of more than 7,000 different sources, founder Brian Gitt said. That same data can also help companies like solar panel providers demonstrate to potential customers how much money they would save, making it easier to sway them. The same can be true to other home improvement providers and the like that might make recommendations on how to reduce those costs. All this leads to a total potential market of $1.5 billion, in which UtilityScore would charge around $95,000 in licensing on average per year.

 
 
 
WorkRamp — Training software for the enterprise
Recruiting can be expensive, but finding the best talent for your company is absolutely critical to success. But what often gets overlooked is that the people a company hires also have an opportunity to keep learning and become more valuable to the company over time. WorkRamp is building training software for companies like PayPal and Square that helps further train those employees, increasing the impact they have at a company over time. Sales representatives, for example, can come on to WorkRamp and record a pitch that their peers and mentors can view and send feedback in order to get better at their jobs. That’s one example of the exercises, which are designed to be more personalized. The company has booked $120,000 in annual recurring revenue from those companies already.

 
RigPlenish – Reduce ambulance paperwork
One third of ambulance time is spent filling out paperwork. RigPlenish says it can reduce 40 minutes of paperwork per ambulance run to just 4 minutes. It charges $2,000 a month to automate checklists and compliance while improving communication between ambulance hubs and hospitals. It already has a paid customer and letters of intent from two more big players that together amount for 4.4 million ambulance runs per year. With 55,000 ambulances in the US, RigPlenish is addressing a $1.3 billion market. Next, it wants to improve the backend software for fire trucks and police. Responders should be saving lives, not doing busy work.

 
GTrack Technologies – Nanoparticle oil well analytics
By pumping nanoparticles into fracking wells and detecting what comes back up, GTrack can quantify the amount of oil and gas available to suck up. It allows oil and gas companies to learn more about where and where not to drill. In one pilot, a company spent $20,000 on GTrack, but soon learned it didn’t need to undertake a $500,000 cleanup operation. Its team has spent seven years working with nanomaterials and has three patents. Oil and gas companies spend $12.5 billion a year on production analytics already, and next GTrack wants to get into industries like geothermal, mining and groundwater remediation, and power plant runoff. Anytime fluid flow needs to be traced, GTrack’s nanoparticles could show what’s happening underground.

950,"EVEN Electric will sell only EVs, but not in the US",https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/23/even-electric-will-sell-only-evs-but-not-in-the-us/,2016/08/23,"
EVEN Electric may be based in Ottawa, Ontario, but it has its sights set on selling electric vehicles from multiple brands worldwide. The sales and distribution network — not a dealership — will have new and pre-owned EVs available via centralized processing centers in several countries. Buyers order their car online, and it will be shipped from the nearest processing center to a local Customer Center, or even your house.
The idea is to reduce the overhead required when there’s a stand-alone dealership in every city. With the EVEN model, the inventory is more mobile, depending on demand, and the customer isn’t required to interact with a guy in a horrible tie. Microsoft has partnered with EVEN to provide the backend technology that allows buyers to compare vehicles, check the current inventory at processing centers, and place an order.
The pilot project for the EVEN model took place in Iceland last year, where according to a press release 100 cars were sold and an additional 200 orders were left unfulfilled due to lack of supply. Additional real-world retail experience comes from John Gordon, one of EVEN’s three co-founders, who has been running a multi-maker EV dealership in Canada since 2013. The company is now working with Canada, Norway, Panama, Ireland, Belgium, and the United Kingdom to bring the EVEN experience to buyers.
You’ll notice that the United States is not on that list. Given how testy the traditional dealerships have been about Tesla’s direct-from-the-manufacturer retail model of sales, a multi-maker non-dealership model is going to be a challenge here.
EVEN does have one wheel in the door in the States. It’s partnered with EVoCharge, a Los Angeles company that makes products for the EV charging infrastructure industry. But while a retractable cable reel, which EVoCharge makes, is handy for a charging station, it’s not a processing center with dozens of EVs on hand waiting for buyers.
The laws regarding who can sell vehicles and how, and the culture around car sales, will have to undergo a major overhaul before a company like EVEN Electric might try to crack the US market.

951,Tesla’s new Model S P100D adds range and cranks Ludicrous Mode up a notch,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/23/teslas-new-model-s-p100d-adds-range-and-cranks-ludicrous-mode-up-a-notch/,2016/08/23,"
Tesla has a new, larger battery option for the Model S and Model X line of electric vehicles, which includes an improved Ludicrous Mode that boasts a 2.5 second 0-60 mph time on the Model S, which is 0.1 second faster than the Model S’s previous max, and only 0.2 seconds off one of the fastest accelerating production cars available.
The 100kWh battery option isn’t just for speed, of course – it also adds range, giving you 315 total miles according to EPA-standard estimates, which is over 20 miles more than the maxed out version of the previous top-end 90kWh battery. But let’s get back to that Ludicrous Mode option, w which part-and-parcel of the beefier battery upgrade.
For comparison, consider that the 2014 Porsche 918 Spyder is one of the fastest production cars available, with a 0-60 mph time of 2.3  seconds, and a 9.9 second quarter mile. As mentioned, Tesla’s own maxed out previous Model S before today could manage 0-60 in 2.6 seconds. That car started at $847,000 new; the P100D is about $134,500 delivered to start. Even the Model X is quick off the draw, with a 2.9 second 0-60 mph time when equipped with the P100D and Ludicrous Mode.
The cost of the upgrade is considerable, since you can upgrade from the price of the P90D Ludicrous for an additional $10,000 if you pre-ordered but haven’t received your vehicle. If you’ve already got the P90D in your garage or driveway, you can upgrade for $20,000, which Tesla says includes the cost of recycling the old battery pack.
Tesla is also being upfront about the fact that the expensive frills of the P100D models will go to good use – it notes in its official blog post that the sales of these will help “pay for the smaller and much more affordable Tesla Model 3 that is in development.”

Elon Musk is going to unveil some Tesla product news at noon PT (3 PM ET) today, and the market is liking the potential, despite the CEO not providing any details. Share price for Tesla is up over 2 percent on the NASDAQ as of this writing, in anticipating of whatever Tesla is preparing to unveil.


Tesla product announcement at noon California time today
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 23, 2016



A couple of possibilities come to mind: this has been a busy couple of weeks for autonomous driving technology news, with Ford and Uber making material announcements about their own self-driving projects, and former Tesla supplier Mobileye announcing a new partnership with Delphi to produce an end-to-end Level 4/Level 5 autonomous driving systems designed to give carmakers an off-the-shelf hardware and software suite by 2019.
Tesla’s own Autopilot successor has been routed for a while now, and Elon Musk himself has said recently on a conference call that what Tesla is prepping in terms of a fully-autonomous car will “blow you away,” since it “blows his mind.” During the call, he also noted that Tesla’s Level 4 self-driving tech would “come sooner than people think.”
All of that fits with the idea that today could be the day for Tesla to lift the curtain on what it’s been working on with fully autonomous vehicles. Stay tuned, since we’ll have all the news regarding what Tesla’s showing off later today.

953,Mobileye and Delphi aim to bring self-driving cars to market as early as 2019,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/23/mobileye-and-delphi-aim-to-bring-self-driving-cars-to-market-as-early-as-2019/,2016/08/23,"
Mobileye, a key supplier of components like image processing  and computer vision systems for automakers, announced a partnership with self-driving software and hardware provider Delphi today to be able to bring Level 4 and 5 automation ready for market to car makers by 2019.
The two companies are coming together with the intend of giving OEMs an end-to-end solution they can use to bring production cars to market. The two will show off the first results of their combined platform at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show in January, and will demo both urban and highway driving autonomy. Following that, the plan is to start broader fleet testing beginning in 2017, with roll-out of test vehicles to various cities and vehicles around the world.
Level 4  and 5 autonomy involve the vehicle operating without driver involvement at all, letting people in the car concentrate entirely on other activities. On a conference call discussing the news, Delphi CEO Kevin Clark said that the plan for the system the partnership is building will retain a steering wheel, brake and gas pedal in the car so that a driver can take over if necessary or desired. This contrasts with Ford’s vision of putting cars without steering wheels or brakes on the road by 2021, but presumably if true level 4 or 5 autonomy is achieved via the partnership, manual controls would be optional for OEMs
Part of the goal of the union is to reduce the cost for carmakers, Mobileye CTO Ammon Shashua explained on the call. The system will be “camera and radar-centric,” and involved LiDAR only as “a redundant cost” which will bring the hardware “cost of the entire system to a few thousand dollars for OEMs.” Component cost is a key concern for adding full autonomy to production vehicles, and a reason why companies are investing in reducing the cost of LiDAR in general.
The partnership’s stated goal is to bring its system to production by 2019, and Clark said on the call that depending on how early carmakers come on board as test partners, that could mean it arrives on shipping vehicles as early as late 2019, or early 2020.
Asked about the seeming uptick in urgency around getting Level 4 and 5 autonomous cars on the road, Clark cited heightened regulatory scrutiny and a focus on safety as causing the drive to skip ahead to full driverless tech.
“What we’d say is what you’re seeing is accelerated demand for active safety solutions ultimately pulling forward the demand for level 4 and level 5, part of which is driven by the success of shared mobility solutions out there,” Clark noted on the call.

954,This could be Faraday Future’s answer to the Tesla Model X,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/23/this-could-be-faraday-futures-answer-to-the-tesla-model-x/,2016/08/23,"
Faraday Future is driving a camouflaged version of a real upcoming production EV in LA, according to Electrek. The site reports that a candid shot of a covered-up SUV is actually a test vehicle from the Californian would-be Tesla competitor backed by Chinese consumer gadget company LeEco.
The vehicle looks like a crossover-style SUV, similar to a Tesla Model X, and this is in line with previous reports that Faraday was looking to field a $100,000-plus luxury sport utility crossover, which would essentially slot right into the market where the shipping Tesla car already plays.


There’s a new vehicle in LA 🌿👀🌿 pic.twitter.com/h21ZjCT3rg
— Everette Taylor (@Everette) August 22, 2016



The SUV would be its first production car, after the company unveiled a far less practical, but flashier FFZER01 concept at this year’s CES. The FFZER01 actually looks like something out of Nintendo’s F-Zero futuristic sci-fi racing game series, and has over 1,000 HP and a sub-three second 0-60 mph time – on paper.
The circus show that is Faraday’s concept EV racer is a far-cry from something you’d be able to use to get your groceries, which is why this test vehicle is so interesting. Faraday has a lot to prove in terms of stepping up as a viable EV company, after all.

Allstate is on a mission to vertically develop its telematics expertise and find new sources of revenue across different sectors by launching a new standalone unit called Arity (dedicated to data collection and analytics). It’s no surprise that Allstate’s own brands, such as Esurance and Answer Financial (which only last month announced the release of a telematics app called Streetwise Drivers Club), are clients. It’s a start on the path to the unknown.
Allstate has been using telematics over the last six years to encourage safe driving — but apparently safe driving is too much of a lofty goal for a for-profit insurer that has already invested tens of millions of dollars in telematics.
That was then
Allstate launched its voluntary Drivewise program in Illinois at the end of 2010. Participants received a dongle to install in their car with the promise of an immediate 10 percent enrollment discount and up to 30 percent performance discount on their auto insurance premium if they practiced safe driving. This wasn’t at all different from Progressive’s Snapshot device, which in its earlier days was called MyRate.
While Progressive was the first U.S. insurer to launch a wireless telematics device, Allstate was the first insurer to launch a telematics smartphone app that works instead of or alongside its plug-in wireless device and is tied to a points system. These devices typically track mileage, braking, speed and time of day when a customer drives, while newer developments of telematics apps also have a GPS component that can track whereabouts. So far, customers haven’t freaked out about their loss of privacy.
Fast followers ensued; currently, 80 percent of the top 10 private passenger auto insurers offer one of two sorts of telematics program (or both): pay-how-you-drive (PHYD) or pay-as-you-drive (PAYD).

This is now
Insurers are trial and erroring their way to market penetration
One thing that is telling about the struggles insurers face in their path to usage-based insurance (UBI) penetration is the change in tactics deployed by insurers. Originally, newly rolled out telematics programs were monetary-reward-only programs. More recently though, Progressive introduced the fine print of “Snapshot doesn’t always save people money; and on occasion, it could increase your rate,” typically during renewal.
Allstate, on the other hand, launched Allstate Rewards to allow any Drivewise drivers, and not just Allstate customers, to earn points that can later be converted to benefits in the form of merchandise, gift cards and local deals. The latter is perhaps the first signal that Allstate has a bigger vision on how it could leverage customers’ data beyond a “customer loyalty-slash-retention play.” As it stands, according to SimilarWeb, its Drivewise Android app was downloaded between 50,000 to 100,000 times, placing any bragging rights on hold.
Moving on to State Farm, the leading insurer is playing both sides by offering a Drive Safe & Save telematics program tied to monetary rewards, as well as its Driver Feedback app that strictly provides tools for drivers to self-assess their driving behaviors, because safe driving is its own prize.
 
Attract-and-retain turned reward-and-retain
When all things are considered, the use of technology coupled with discounts to attract and retain lowest-risk drivers is a novel concept — one that very quickly eradicated any sort of competitive advantage due to the share of competitors with similar offerings and the cost to deploy such solutions (whether device-based or app-based).
Telematics is both an IT and a marketing expense.
First, the majority of top insurers offer similar programs, and there’s no evidence to suggest that insurers without a telematics offering fare worse than their counterparts. In fact, in 2013, Geico, aka the odd one out, surpassed Allstate to become the second-largest U.S. auto insurer, according to data compiled by SNL.
So while Allstate and Progressive saw their dollars flow, or should I say Flo, into telematics, Geico gave its marketing budget a boost and achieved a noteworthy milestone, sustained to this day. In the grand scheme of things, most insurers with telematics propositions have continued to boost their advertising budget over the years despite their offering of a more cost-conscious, better yet, “fair” insurance policy, which should have sold itself. Takeaway No. 1: Telematics is both an IT and a marketing expense.

Second, retaining customers via rewards isn’t a long-term strategy, it’s a tactic — and a very expensive one indeed, especially for insurers that need to execute this kind of operation. In reality, three-fourth of telematics customers receive an average savings of 14 percent. That comes out to ~$118 in annual discount when factoring the average auto insurance policy premium being $841, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Again, nothing to brag about, albeit this piece is somewhat subjective. Takeaway No. 2: Operating costs and actual savings discount any telematics discount.
So what gives?
The case for a more personalized pricing structure made possible because of this technology fits nicely with niche players like Metromile and Marmalade, that either target low-mileage or inexperienced drivers.
Five-year-old pay-per-mile San Francisco-based MGU Metromile (which is active in California, Illinois, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington) has a single UBI solution targeting low-mileage drivers who drive less than 10,000 miles a year. The case for product-market fit.
U.K.-based specialist insurer Marmalade operates in the land of the young and the restless, targeting young drivers (age 17-24) via a telematics offering, in which discounts are granted during renewal; a bigger likelihood of drivers staying with the insurer for at least two years. The case for the beauty is in the details.
 
Reaching for the safe
Over the long term, “safe driving” will become a goal pursued by several players that in turn will put into question how big of a role a single insurer can play in this field and actually achieve both scale and engagement. There will always be others, whether auto manufacturers or tech behemoths, that will introduce technological improvements to hands-free technologies and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), deeming driving scores irrelevant.

The insurance industry is associated with high-touch, low-frequency customer touch points, and it is that sore spot that has led to the quest by insurers to create more touch points — but in reality, forced business models on what should have been a short-lived engagement gadget (after all, how long should drivers be asked to validate they are safe drivers?) for many mass insurers (with the emphasis on mass).
The challenge lies between seeking the masses to capture more big data versus seeking a fit within segments of the insurance population. Now, Allstate is spreading its wings beyond insurance, looking to justify its telematics costs in the name of big data, now the turf of Arity.
Looking forward
This is the era where insurers try to sell insurance in a hundred different ways, seeking meaningful and positive touch points with their customers. Mass insurers haven’t figured out yet their sustainable sweet spot around telematics, but, for now, they are busy satisfying their underwriting curiosity with fancier data sets. That, by itself, is an experience worth paying for; the question is, for how long?

956,Sony’s new $500 in-dash receiver looks like the best value for Android Auto and CarPlay,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/22/sonys-new-500-in-dash-receiver-looks-like-the-best-value-for-android-auto-and-carplay/,2016/08/22,"
Sony’s XAV-AX100 in-dash car stereo system might be the best way to get your hands on Android Auto or CarPlay without plunking down a fortune for a new car. The new receivers will retail for $499.99 when it hits stores in late November, and boasts a 6.4-inch, 800 x 480 touch screen, along with NFC support, Bluetooth, aux input and a dedicated hardware button for triggering voice input.
The XAV-AX100 has some decided advantages compared to the competition, at least on paper. The closest competitor from Pioneer is probably the AppRadio 4, which has a 6.2-inch screen, lacks physical buttons and only supports CarPlay, not both – plus it’s $600. From Alpine, you’re looking at paying similar prices or more.
Sony’s decision to offer up a device-agnostic, affordable in-dash receiver with a generous touchscreen is smart, especially in a space where there was a flurry of early activity by aftermarket system makers, but not much in the way of competitive offerings since then.

Blockchain is empowering the future of insurance




Technology in the mobility space has made travel safer, faster and more convenient. The results have been incredible: The Insurance Information Institute found a 33 percent decrease in automobile deaths in the past three years. The same survey found that nine models registered zero fatalities per vehicle per million. Mobility has also become more accessible with ride-hailing apps like Uber and Lyft delivering more than one million rides a day in more than 60 countries.
Despite the upside, there are consequences to innovation. On May 7th of this year, a Tesla owner died while using the Autopilot feature. His vehicle crashed into a truck after his Tesla failed to differentiate the white color of the truck against the backdrop of the sky. This event may change the narrative and public appeal for autonomous driving. It puts into perspective how close the future actually is and whether or not society will fully embrace it.
Autonomous driving promises to decrease the automobile death toll. Last year there were 35,000 automotive-related deaths, accounting for .01 percent of the U.S. population. While it may not seem like a high number, those deaths are the result of people, not an algorithm that holds a passenger’s life within its source code. This brings us to question the liability programmers and the code they write be given the power to determine life and death for consumers who buy their cars. And ultimately, who is liable in the case of an accident or even death?
The next critical step is the proliferation of autonomous driving and the task of safely embedding its utility within the framework of our society. With these issues in mind, private companies and governmental agencies are taking appropriate steps to address them. Google has been testing and building a fleet of self-driving cars that have completed 1.5 million miles of road tests.
In 2014, the U.S. Department of Transportation approved vehicle-to-vehicle technology that enabled vehicles to “talk” to one another and can help prevent human errors that often lead to collision. And this March, General Motors acquired a startup called Cruise Automation for $1 billion. GM was already on pace to launch a highway-oriented, smart cruise control system in its Cadillac CT6 line. Technological and governmental infrastructure for autonomous vehicles is well on its way to maturity.
Driving technology may never replace drivers, but it could help us become less injury prone.
But there are a number of factors that will decide whether the mass adoption of autonomous driving will actually happen. Consumer acceptance is one factor. Not everyone may want a self- driving vehicle. Americans actually love cars; Experian Automotive reports that each household owns 2.28 cars on average. If the idea of autonomous vehicles were to become widely adopted, the end user will eventually need to view travel and car ownership as separate concepts, a concept highlighted in Elon Musk’s master plan.
Deloitte believes there are four future stages of mobility: incremental change, car sharing, driverless revolution and accessible autonomy. The road that our current model is headed down is a driverless revolution, where consumers may still own their car but the vehicle will have the capabilities to operate itself. While all four stages may exist simultaneously, they may not necessarily distribute evenly among every segment of the population. The driverless-revolution stage may indicate incremental change from what we have now, much like GM’s new self-driving Cadillac technology.

Accessible autonomy will impact auto insurance significantly. For starters, fewer accidents will result in fewer claims and less in losses for insurance carriers. David Zuby, EVP and Chief Research Officer at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety stated, “Vehicles equipped with front crash prevention technology have a 7-15% lower claim frequency under property damage liability coverage.” This is a win-win situation; not only will technology prevent accidents, insurance companies will pay out fewer claims.

Insurance companies will also need to develop new, innovative products before autonomous vehicles become widespread. Crash-prevention technology will play a huge role in lowering premiums during the driverless-revolution stage. Insurance companies will need to find new products they can sell. In the car-sharing stage, insurance companies sold gap insurance and ride sharing policies to companies like Uber and Lyft. Drivers needed coverage when they picked up and dropped off guests.
The premiums from the new policies cost more, as well. Geico’s personal policies for a male living in Chicago would cost $1,140, while its ride-sharing policy for the same individual would cost $3,743. Autonomous car policies could follow the same pricing increase strategy.
The Tesla incident may deter the public from fully embracing autonomous vehicles. Self-driving cars may never reach accessible autonomy and might only be an add-on feature. It is very likely that the driver will still be liable for the actions of their vehicles. This means that drivers will still need auto insurance. Driving technology may never replace drivers, but it could help us become less injury prone.

Charles Chilton is the Director of Engineering at Navistar and has more than 25 years of leadership experience in product planning, product development, engineering and personnel management in both public and private companies. He has worked on a variety of commercial vehicle brands throughout his career, including Thomas Built Buses, Freightliner, E-One and International Truck.


Google has long held the spotlight in developing driverless technology; however, with the emergence of Otto and Elon Musk’s announcement of a Tesla Semi, “driverless trucks” are coming to the forefront of the autonomous vehicle conversation.
One major reason the trucking industry is so interested in driverless technology is a chronic shortage of truck drivers, which is threatening to get worse as the Baby Boom generation hits retirement age.
But despite the increased spotlight on autonomous trucks, the reality is that trucking technology still has a long way to go before we see trucks on the road without drivers.
In the meantime, many new technology advances are already helping with the driver shortage by expanding the impact of today’s drivers — while also making trucks and highways safer.
These advanced technology systems, collectively referred to as “Advanced Driver Assistance Systems” (ADAS), begin with simple convenience tools, like power steering, cruise control and automated gear changing. These tools are so common in passenger cars that most of us take them for granted, but they are crucial stepping stones toward higher degrees of vehicle autonomy.
Tools like traction control and anti-lock braking systems (ABS) go beyond mere convenience, and are especially helpful for truck drivers. They act as skill compensators, making it easier and safer for drivers to address challenging road conditions.
The same goes for advances in electronic stability control (ESC) — the computerized technology improves a vehicle’s stability by actively assessing road conditions to adjust vehicle handling in order to reduce potential skidding and roll overs. Radar and digital-camera technologies further elevate ADAS by compensating for drivers’ blind spots and detecting lane departures.
Ultimately, the goal is to convert most accidents into near-misses — or better.
Even more impressive is what happens when these tools work together. The combined technology is capable of detecting objects in the truck’s path, alerting the driver, then automatically braking the vehicle — if necessary — in advance of a potential collision. Adaptive cruise control also uses laser- and radar-based systems to help trucks maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
In the trucking business, beyond the obvious importance of assisting the driver in safer vehicle operation, risk mitigation is also a powerful motivator. Because trucks and the cargo they carry are significantly bigger than passenger vehicles, truck accidents can carry major price tags. By reducing the kinetic energy of an accident, such systems can mitigate both personal injury and property damage. Ultimately, the goal is to convert most accidents into near-misses — or better.
In addition to an end goal of autonomy, risk avoidance is a powerful incentive for trucking companies to adopt such technologies. Combining these tools enables vehicle platooning — the ability to line up trucks in a row and automatically brake and accelerate them as one. Demonstrations of this technology in Nevada, and most recently in Europe, shows how close the industry is getting to fully autonomous trucks.

This technology is continually being perfected through initiatives like Mcity, a public-private R&D partnership at the University of Michigan that is working to develop a commercially viable ecosystem of connected and automated driverless vehicles in urban and suburban environments.
Frankly, there’s never been a more exciting time to be part of the trucking industry. Innovations in vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-infrastructure and vehicle-to-anything communication will push the envelope beyond even these advances. By improving the flow of traffic, such systems can enable today’s highway infrastructure to be used more efficiently.
As a result, beyond improved productivity for drivers, we’ll also see a reduction in the number and severity of accidents, greatly improved fuel economy and significant environmental benefit. While there is still time before on-highway driverless trucks are the norm, there are still several technologies available today that augment drivers’ skills to make the road smoother and safer.

What does the future of Cadillac look like? The Escala, the company’s new concept car, holds the answers. The Escala is on show publicly for the first time at the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance this weekend, and reveals a car that takes its name (Spanish for ‘scale’) to heart, as a larger sedan that previews the future lines of Cadillac’s body design, and the next stage of evolution for what it puts inside its cars, too.
The Escala is larger than the Cadillac CT6, its current production luxury sedan, with a four-dour design that measures 210.5 inches in length, which is about half a foot longer than the CT6, tip to tail. The generous proportions are definitely a bit of a retro edge to this future-focused vehicle, but the rest of the car is all cutting edge.

It’s a showcase for tech that’s coming soon to Cadillac’s production line, including new headlights that use OLED elements to deliver an even slimmer variation of the company’s trademark vertical headlight look. Cadillac itself describes this as resulting in “a sinister look” –  and insofar as a car is capable of that, it does ring true.
Cadillac’s design here is aimed at delivering a great driving experience, and that’s the reasoning behind a new style of instrument panel that replaces the traditional dials and displays with a set of three curved OLED screens. These are some of the more interesting aspects of the car from a tech perspective, giving the driver a lot of real estate for car info, cabin controls, communications and entertainment displays.

Cadillac’s concept images show the displays offering up info on an owner’s upcoming calendar entries, field phone calls, showing info about passengers and in-car data connections, and replicating traditional instrumentation. When asked about the flexibility of the system, Cadillac told me that the car can show any info traditionally shown by dashboard gauges or infotainment displays, and that they can be customized based on user preference.
Seat-integrated displays for passengers complete the infotainment picture for those who prefer to be driven. Under the hood, the car boasts a 4.2-liter twin-turbo V-8 engine that’s a prototype version of an engine system designed for use in future production cars.
Cadillac says it wanted to create a car that was both fun to drive, and equally great for being driven in – just for the record, I’m up for either.

In-vehicle infotainment systems on newer cars increasingly offer access to your favorite media and navigation apps, thanks to systems like CarPlay and Android Auto, but older cars from even just a few years ago can still feel stuck in a connected tech first gear. Hudly, which debuted on Kickstarter today, wants to change that with an easy-to-install aftermarket heads-up display (HUD) add-on that won’t break the bank.
The system features three parts, including a projector that mounts at the top of your windshield near your rear-view mirror, and a transparent glass display that attaches down closer to the steering wheel in your line of sight, along with a tether that plugs into your car’s OBD-II port (located under the steering wheel in most cars made since 1996) to gather info about your car’s speed, fuel levels and more. And while that combo alone can provide a decent amount of info, Hudly’s real potential comes in being able to show you the iOS and Android apps you already know and love, including Waze, Google Maps and more.

Hudly connects to iPhone 4 and newer iOS devices, as well as Android phones, via an HDMI input. That means you’ll also need a Lightning-to-HDMI adapter for iPhones, and an MHL capable for Android devices. This will allow it to mirror your screen to show whatever you want on the transparent glass display, which is great for letting you do things you can’t do out of the box on CarPlay, for instance, like use mapping or navigation software not made by Apple.
With great power comes great responsibility, and Hudly’s power to display any app on your phone means that it’s up to the driver to exercise caution regarding what they do and don’t show on the screen. That’s nothing new, however, when it comes to aftermarket infotainment: installers have been putting parking brake override switches alongside in-dash systems from the likes of Pioneer, Alpine and others for years. Shhh.
Hudly says it’s already successfully completed product design and is ready for production at scale, hence the need for the funds from the Kickstarter campaign. It’s targeting December 2016 as the delivery date for its first backer reward units, which are currently available starting at $179. Other HUD solutions like Navdy hope to offer similar and given the increased interest in car tech in general, there’s likely to be a lot more that follow this train of thought.

961,Tesla Model S aftermarket wireless charging is almost here,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/18/tesla-model-s-aftermarket-wireless-charging-is-almost-here/,2016/08/18,"

Aftermarket EV charging company Evatran is almost ready to start shipping its Plugless wireless charging aftermarket solution to Tesla Model S owners who pre-ordered the product, and a new video shows the production system in action. As you can see, what the company offers is a way to create a drive-up wireless charging pad, which provides induction power via an add-on module installed on the Tesla itself.
And before you even ask, Plugless has a network of installers who do this part for Model S owners, included in the cost of purchase (currently $2,440 per system). The add-on won’t affect your warranty, either — even though Tesla and Plugless don’t have any official relationship, and Plugless is strictly an aftermarket add-on, so long as the Plugless system doesn’t negatively affect the vehicle there’s no effect on your warranty. Plus, the company tells me it offers its own three-year warranty that will cover the cost of any impact its system has on your car, though it hasn’t run into any issues with its add-ons for other vehicles.
Plugless charges at a rate of about 7.2kW, which provides a minimum of 20 miles of driving time per hour, and it’s rated for use either indoors or outdoors. The current version works with rear-wheel drive Tesla S models only, with plans to introduce support for all-wheel drive versions beginning later this year.
Evatran says the first installations are going to start rolling out in a few weeks to a small group of initial reservation holders, with more broad roll-out ramping up in the fall.
It’s a very different approach from Tesla’s robotic snake charger, but one that’s probably more practical in the near-term.

962,Jobless in the self-driving economy,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/18/dropping-off-drivers/,2016/08/18,"
Uber’s self-driving cars will hit the road this month, earlier than anticipated. That’s an exciting surprise…unless of course you’re a driver. They won’t be the only ones affected, though. The consequences of robot-induced unemployment could eventually ripple through the rest of the economy.
What will happen to Uber’s 1 million drivers? And the 3.5 million truck drivers in the US? And the countless millions of delivery, bus, taxi, and other drivers around the world?
These jobs won’t disappear overnight. It could take 20 years. But if we don’t plan for this labor shift, it could cause mass hardship for some even while delivering mass convenience to others.

Self-driving cars are undoubtedly the future. They’ll be significantly safer and more relaxing. They’ll reduce traffic and carbon emissions. And they could free up productive time for knowledge workers that used to be spent stuck behind the wheel.
They’ll also be a lot cheaper than paying a person to pilot the vehicle.
Bloomberg writes, “Trips will be free for the time being, rather than the standard local rate of $1.30 per mile. In the long run, [Uber CEO Travis] Kalanick says, prices will fall so low that the per-mile cost of travel, even for long trips in rural areas, will be cheaper in a driverless Uber than in a private car.” Oh, and Uber just announced it has acquired a self-driving truck company.
Dropped Off
The problem is driving constitutes one of the core forms of low-skilled labor alongside cashiers and fast-food prep. The robots are coming for all of them. Some argue that technology will create new jobs for these people. Though while it may create new jobs, they likely won’t be attainable by those losing their low-skilled ones.
Think of it this way. When cars were invented, they threatened the low-skilled laborers that used to bring people and objects around: horses. As laid out by this fantastic Humans Need Not Apply video, the idea that “better technology will create more better jobs for horses” immediately seems ludicrous. Replacing “horses” with “humans” in that sentence shouldn’t inspire much more optimism.

What this shift to autonomy will do to the economy is roll the earnings of the replaced low-skilled laborers up to the owners and designers of the self-driving fleets, cookdroids, and cashierbots. It’s a Marxist nightmare.
Software has already been causing a similar effect, but the proliferation of autonomous robots will allow this revolution to grow beyond bits and invade the realm of atoms.
That’s why the next President needs to start preparing us now, though hopefully without impeding the speed of innovation. Education, job training, and placement services will be essential. Hell, just recognizing and talking about the problem will be a good start.
Long-term, we’ll need to take a long, hard look at how capitalism works in an era where technology replaces jobs faster than it creates them. Must everyone have a full-time role? Can we redistribute wealth from the top so the bottom doesn’t starve without devolving into inefficiency and stagnation? How would that impact the psyches of citizens raised to define their own value by how much bread they earn, not how much they receive?
Those are complicated questions without definitive answers. We’ll need plenty of time to figure them out. But today Uber made it clear the future’s ETA is a lot sooner than we expected.

963,The business side of the Karma reboot,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/18/the-business-side-of-the-karma-reboot/,2016/08/18,"
In 2009, I went to what was probably the saddest auto show Detroit has ever seen. It was the January after the economy collapsed and auto makers were teetering on the edge of going bust. But there were a couple of bright spots in the hall filled with smaller car companies, where Tesla and Fisker Automotive both had vehicles on display. (There was also a Chevy Volt in the bigger hall.) The Fisker Karma was a plug-in hybrid luxury car with a high-tech solar panel on the roof.
But if it was tough for the largest auto manufacturers in the world in the years that followed, it was really tough for a new car company to launch. Fisker Automotive raised $1.3 billion and made almost 2500 Karmas before ceasing production and then declaring bankruptcy in 2013. In February 2014, Chinese industrial conglomerate Wanxiang bought Fisker Automotive for $149 million. (It had purchased EV battery maker A123 Systems, which had also filed for bankruptcy, in 2013.)
Company cofounder Henrik Fisker had already left, so the new company was rebranded as Karma. It made use of that billion-dollar investment by updating the technology of its new car, the Karma Revero, while retaining the crash-tested body of the Fisker Karma. “It gave us a huge jump on relaunching the car,” said Jim Taylor, Karma’s chief revenue officer, in a phone interview. “It’s a proven design that allowed us to make minor changes to it without huge risks.”
Karma kept a low profile on purpose while developing the new car. “We wanted to wait until we had a production plan rather than setting off huge fireworks without anything to show for a long time,” Taylor said. The company is pursuing a low-key approach overall; the Revero is a niche product, so production volume of the premium sedan at its southern California facility will be low.
Despite the anticipated reduction in costs of batteries and electric vehicle production over the past few years, “it’s still costly,” Taylor said. “[In the premium segment,] you have a better chance of recouping costs.” He also noted that cars like the Revero are an emotional purchase, not a practical decision. Often, cars in this segment are being added to a personal fleet of vehicles rather than being used as primary transportation.
Karma is staying quiet on the details of the new powertrain and software in the Revero, which will be revealed when the car is shown at an event on September 8. This launch has been the company’s focus up to now, with US deliveries to begin in the first quarter of 2017 and sales in Europe and China on the horizon. And there’s another car on the drawing board and very deep under wraps: “We can’t be a one-car company,” Taylor said.

Amazon’s Alexa skill set continues to grow, and owners of the Genesis G80 and G90 from Hyundai’s standalone luxury car brand are the latest to benefit. Genesis now uses lets Amazon Echo, Tap, Dot and Fire TV owners use voice commands to remotely start their engine, set climate control, lock and unlock doors and honk the horn or turn on the lights, all from the comfort of their own home.
The Amazon Alexa features is available today, unlike similar Alexa skills in the works from other luxury carmakers (BMW is set to offer remote commands for Alexa later this year). G90 owners also get a free Amazon.com Gift Card they can use towards the purchase of an Amazon Echo, in case they want the voice commands but don’t actually have the hardware to do it.

To ensure not just anyone can issue voice commands to your ride, you have to log into your Genesis Connected Services account inside the Alexa app to get this working, and Alexa will ask users for their Genesis PIN to make sure they actually should be able to do things like unlock the car or start the engine. Connected services from Genesis are included free for three years for new car buyers, and also include things like automatic collision detection and emergency roadside assistance.
Alexa skills are still limited to commands issued by home-based devices to the car, and not in-car control, which remains a dream just out of reach for me.

965,Uber and Volvo put $300M into building self-driving cars ready for sale by 2021,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/18/uber-and-volvo-put-300m-into-building-self-driving-cars-ready-for-sale-by-2021/,2016/08/18,"
Part of the arrangement that will bring self-driving Uber on-demand vehicles to Pittsburgh roads by the end of this year will also help Volvo bring its own self-driving cars, for use as either personal vehicles or as autonomous taxis, to market by 2021, according to the WSJ. The two companies are investing a combined $300 million, roughly split between the two, in a deal that will seek to achieve production of a road-ready autonomous car based on the XC90 SUV platform.
The arrangement reveals what Volvo gets out of the deal that will help Uber beat rivals including Google and Ford, who are planning driverless on-demand fleets, to commercial launch. Volvo’s investment and participation in the plan will likely benefit from Uber’s autonomous technology engineering expertise, which is built on the back of a team that includes the former head of Google’s self-driving car project, as well Twitter’s former VP of engineering, and which also includes a good chunk of Carnegie Mellon’s advanced robots department academics.
Volvo’s vision for the car still plans to have a driver behind the wheel, but also includes fully autonomous capabilities. The funds will be used to develop the hardware required, including sensor for object and collision avoidance, as well as fuelling research and software development. Volvo also hopes to start experimenting with self-driving car road tests in China, Britain and Sweden as a result of advances coming from the arrangement.
The deal also gives both companies freedom to continue to woo other partners in their pursuit of autonomous driving tech, according to Reuters, and also specifies that employees will generally operate within their own respective companies, rate than act as shared resources between the two.
2021 is shaping up to be a big year for self-driving vehicles, as earlier this week Ford announced its intent to also introduce autonomous cars at scale to the market by that time, intended for use primarily in driverless taxi fleets.

966,Uber’s launch of self-driving cars mimics its approach to ride-for-hire,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/18/ubers-launch-of-self-driving-cars-mimics-its-approach-to-ride-for-hire/,2016/08/18,"
Uber revealed today that it would put self-driving Volvo SUVs on the road in Pittsburgh, picking up actual passengers, with a driver on board only to make sure everything goes smoothly. It’s a launch of near-complete autonomous vehicles that seemed to come out of nowhere – just like Uber itself.
In Bloomberg’s telling of the launch of Uber’s self-driving program, they note that Uber starting road-testing their vehicles in May, something the company has managed to keep under wraps until now. Uber also formed its self-driving business in earnest only a little over one year ago, in January 2015 with the hire of John Bares and employees reporting to him. The apparent goal was to replace its human drivers with robots in as short a time as possible, which Bloomberg says could be interpreted by some as “audacious, even reckless.”
But “audacious, even reckless” is what Uber is good at. The company’s e-hailing business usurped a U.S. taxi industry with a near monopoly on city-based ride-for-hire services with a speed that many would’ve thought impossible at the time, too; Uber was founded in 2009, and launched officially in SF in 2011. Over the course of 2012 and 2013, it quickly spread across the U.S. and into a good chunk of major international urban cities.
Uber’s expansion in its early days is remarkable for a few reasons – one, because building this kind of offering in new cities means having local resources, and is far more friction-heavy than expanding availability of say, a social app. And two, because Uber faced pushback from legacy taxi industry players, including lobby groups, and from local lawmakers and regulators.
Much of the company’s ability to leap over obstacles early on, and get out ahead of competitors including Lyft and Hailo, can probably be ascribed to CEO Travis Kalanick’s take-no-prisoners, move-fast-and-break-things attitude. I’d add ‘ask for forgiveness, not permission,’ but Kalanick rarely seemed interested in the former during the early days.
While Kalanick has smoothed out some of his rougher edges in the intervening years as Uber has grown to massive scale, a quote from the Bloomberg piece reminds us how he built the company into what it is today – “We are going commercial. This can’t just be about science.”
‘Damn the risks’ is a very bold way to go about developing self-driving tech, especially in a world where Tesla faces a lot of scrutiny from regulators and customers about a vehicle death involving it’s Autopilot autonomous highway driving features. But Uber will be Uber, and that could be very beneficial in terms of speeding up the ultimate arrival of self-driving cars on actual roads.
Uber’s approach with building its basic e-hailing service has been all about taking action, and doing so quickly without waiting for competitors or the opposition to get its footing. Launching self-driving cars on city roads, picking up actual passengers by the end of 2016? That’s just a natural extension of the Uber way.

967,Uber acquires Otto to lead Uber’s self-driving car effort,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/18/uber-acquires-otto-to-lead-ubers-self-driving-car-effort-report-says/,2016/08/18,"
Uber is making yet another big push in the self-driving car space. In addition to launching self-driving rides in Pittsburgh with the help of Volvo, the company is acquiring Otto and its all-star team according to a new report from Bloomberg.
Otto has been focusing on self-driving technology that could be fitted into trucks that are already on the road now. In other words, Otto didn’t want to develop its own self-driving vehicles — the startup chose to focus on some sort of self-driving kit instead. Otto makes its own lidar sensors.
This fits perfectly into Uber’s strategy as the company doesn’t want to become a car manufacturer. Instead, Uber has been looking at partnerships with existing car manufacturers, such as Volvo, in order to turn their cars into self-driving cars using Uber’s proprietary technology. So get ready for Uber’s self-driving kit.
And then, there’s Otto’s team. Anthony Levandowski is well-known in the self-driving space as he used to work for Google on Google’s self-driving car effort in its early days. Otto’s Lior Ron was head of product at Google Maps. Given that mapping is a key element of self-driving cars, Ron’s experience could help as well.
Other engineers at Otto have worked at Tesla, Apple and Google. According to Bloomberg, Uber doesn’t want to dismantle this team of 91 employees, so Levandowski will lead Uber’s self-driving project, and the existing Otto office in San Francisco will become an Uber R&D center.
Combining Otto’s technology with Uber’s massive push in mapping makes Uber stronger than ever when it comes to putting self-driving cars on the road. Uber will also be able to use its huge user base to tap into ride data and improve its mapping solution.
Uber has no choice but to build self-driving technology if it wants to remain competitive for on-demand rides. It’s clear that prices will drop drastically once Uber can get rid of the driver in the front seat. But nothing will stop other companies from creating Uber competitors based on self-driving cars. Google, BMW, Ford, Mercedes-Benz, GM and literally every car manufacturer out there are working on self-driving cars.
While the acquisition is still in its closing stage, the two companies have agreed to a pricey acquisition just a few months after Otto came out of stealth mode. According to Bloomberg and if target goals are met, the acquisition could be worth 1 percent of Uber’s valuation, representing $680 million. So it sounds like Uber handed out shares for this acquisition.
But that’s not all. If Uber wants to get into the self-driving truck business, existing Otto employees will collectively receive 20 percent of this market’s profit. What a sweet, sweet deal.
We’ve reached out to Uber and Otto and will update this post as we learn more about the acquisition.
Update: Otto has published a blog post confirming the acquisition.

Make way for robot! Two driverless buses will be hitting the streets in Helsinki for some real-world testing for the next month or so, reports Finnish news outlet YLE.
The EasyMile minibuses have previously been tested on public roads in Finland and elsewhere, but this is the first time they’ll be mixing it up with everyday traffic there.

Finnish law, amazingly, doesn’t require a driver to have a vehicle — making it an ideal test bed for at least some kinds of self-driving technologies. These EZ10 buses are intended for short-range shuttling of people, for instance between a train station and bus stop will only travel at a jogging pace.
It may seem old hat to Valley-dwellers who see Google’s self-driving cars zooming around the streets of Mountain View, but different vehicles, with different purposes, in different countries, following different traffic rules may as well be a whole different industry.
I’ve asked EasyMile for more information on what specifically the company will be testing for, and will update this post when I hear back.

969,Hyundai looks to increase collaboration with Google,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/17/hyundai-looks-to-increase-collaboration-with-google/,2016/08/17,"
The self-driving car market is set to get very big, very fast, on the back of efforts by the likes of Ford, GM and other major car makers. Hyundai is not a company often included in the list of OEMs at the cutting edge of autonomous tech, and the South Korean company could use some friends to help it keep pace with the development of autonomous driving tech.
Hyundai is in discussions with Google currently regarding areas where the two companies’ interests overlap, Bloomberg reports, based on an interview with Hyundai Motor Co. president Jeong Jin Hang. The two have worked together on putting Android Auto support into its vehicles, basically covering the lineup in terms of availability in new models. But Haeng’s keeping mum on what exactly it might work on with Google beyond infotainment.
Self-driving tech is a clear candidate, and there’s been some exchange on the subject between the two companies already: Google hired Hyundai U.S. CEO John Krafcik in 2015 to take the lead on its self-driving car project. Google seems to have sought out Krafcik because of his legacy car industry chops, but if it’s looking for deeper car industry expertise to supplement its autonomous driving tech experiments, a proper partnership with an OEM like Hyundai could be an even bigger help.
More collaboration between Hyundai and Google doesn’t necessarily mean self-driving cars, but the advent of robotic vehicles is going to change the face of the industry, so I wouldn’t be surprised to see any vehicle makers that are lagging behind pursue extreme measures to catch up.

970,Automatic Pro adds unlimited 3G to connected car gadget,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/17/automatic-pro-adds-unlimited-3g-to-connected-car-gadget/,2016/08/17,"
The race for aftermarket smarts in your car is heating up, and Automatic is delivering an always-on 3G data connection as its move to race ahead of the competition. The Automatic Pro dongle, which plugs into the OBD-II port used for diagnostics on any car made after 1996, now includes 3G data connectivity, with unlimited usage for the first five years in the price of the hardware.
Automatic Pro retails for $129.95, and includes a new companion app, which has customizable notifications that drivers can tweak based on their preference, alerting them to things like excess speed and too-sudden stops. The app also includes an integration with IFTTT, along with the laundry list of third-party integrations Automatic already offers. Automatic also provides in-app diagnostic of those nasty engine lights that appear on your dash, giving you actual details about your potential problems instead of just lighting up and requiring you to visit a mechanic to get further info.
Always-on cellular means your Automatic Pro hardware will be able to do all of its intelligent work even without an active data connection on your smartphone, and without taxing your data bandwidth caps. Building a persistent, free data connection into the hardware itself is something Amazon has done with its Kindle readers for years, and it definitely makes sense in this context, too, since drivers don’t want to have to worry about their connection status to get the convenience features Automatic offers.
Automatic was already a smart, inexpensive addition to any car, but this embedded data offering should help it do more with its various integrations and the IFTTT recipes it supports. Connecting older cars is a noteworthy goal, and building 3G right in eliminates one more potential complication, which is idea for tech like this that should just work in the background.

971,"In Japan, Priuses can talk to other Priuses",https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/16/in-japan-priuses-can-talk-to-other-priuses/,2016/08/16,"
While the US waits to get Super Cruise in Cadillacs next year, Toyota has already rolled out a pretty robust V2V, or vehicle-to-vehicle, system in three models available in Japan. The latest version of the Prius, the Lexus RX, and the Toyota Crown, a luxury sedan sold in Japan, all have the ITS Connect system available as an option.
The cars communicate using a channel abandoned by analog TV transmissions when they switched to digital a few years ago. The cars send and receive very simple–but very useful–information: location, speed, and heading. “People ask about privacy” regarding these communications said Toyota spokesperson Hideki Hada in a phone interview, “but this is very obvious information.”
He’s right. The cars can communicate up to 300 m (nearly 1000 feet) in a 360-degree radius, a distance that allows a lot of humans to also see where your car is, how fast it’s likely going, and where it’s headed.
Also, the vehicles are communicating directly with each other, no cloud required, via two small antennas on each car. The messages being sent and received are very small and frequent, Hada said, and do not require a lot of processing power.
These three models are equipped to handle V2I, or vehicle-to-infrastructure, communications too. Some traffic signals can send information with their current color and the number of seconds before the light will change to the next color. If it’s about to change to green, the car will tell the driver. If it’s about to change to red, the Prius will kick into an aggressive regen braking mode to recover more energy. Besides managing traffic lights, ITS Connect will also communicate with the car ahead while you’re driving to improve adaptive cruise control and let you know if an emergency vehicle is headed your way.
Hada said it was still too early to see a quantifiable benefit to having V2X communications since there are so few cars on the road using it so far, but more people are adding this optional tech to their new cars than the company expected.
There are two factors driving that uptake. First, Toyota worked with the Japanese government to promote this technology and educate consumers. Hada used a video of a winter pile-up of multiple cars as an example. V2V would help a driver avoid this situation, he said, because it’s communicating with cars 300m ahead that are saying they have stopped. This information would be relayed to both the driver and the central processor to avoid the hazard.
Why not just let the car’s sensors save the day? The collision system alone uses cameras and radar. “These can’t see that far,” Hada said. “Their ranges are far too short.” The same processor receives all information from the sensors and V2X, so the brake system “knows” there’s an accident ahead. With V2V communications, the driver now has more time to apply that brake or evade rather than waiting for the imminent collision and the safety system to kick in at the last second. “If we add one more signal–V2V,” Hada said, “then we can have an earlier warning.”
Now for the second reason people have been eager to add the V2X option: price. Buyers can see right on the invoice what ITS Connect costs: a whopping 17,000 yen. Which is $265. “The goal is to have it in every car, but it takes a while,” Hada said. “We’re not only doing it for tech appeal, [though] we started rolling it out on high-tech appeal cars.”
Red-light communication similar to what the ITS Connect can do is the first step in V2I communications, one that Audi is also taking with three of its 2017 models. And if your city has talking traffic lights (not all do), you can also try out the EnLighten app for iOS and Android in whatever car you have.

972,Ford acquires SAIPS for self-driving machine learning and computer vision tech,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/16/ford-acquires-saips-for-self-driving-machine-learning-and-computer-vision-tech/,2016/08/16,"
Ford outlined a few of the ways it’s aiming to ship driverless cars by 2021, and part of the plan involves acquisitions. CEO Mark Fields revealed at a press event in Palo Alto today that the automaker acquired SAIPS, an Israeli company focusing on machine learning and computer vision. It’s also partnering exclusively with Nirenberg Neuroscience, to bring more “humanlike intelligence” to machine learning components of driverless car systems.
SAIPS’ technology brings image and video processing algorithms, as well as deep learning tech focused on processing and classifying input signals, all key ingredients in the special sauce that makes up autonomous vehicle tech. This company’s expertise should help with on-board interpretation of data captured by sensors on Ford’s self-driving cars, and turning that data into usable info for the car’s virtual driver system. SAIPS’ offerings include detection of anomalies, persistent tracking of objects detected by sensors, and much more. The company’s past clients include HP and Trax, but its partner group doesn’t appear to have included much in the way of driving-specific applications.
Ford noted during today’s announcement event that it identified SAIPS as a potential target through a tech scouting operation it began in Israel in 2013, and quickly determined that the company’s machine learning expertise would help bolster its own efforts.
The Nirenberg partnership similarly takes research applied in a different area to the problems of full autonomous driving. Dr. Sheila Nirenberg’s research focuses on restoring sight to patients with degenerative retinal disease, but Ford thinks the tech can be used to help its virtual drivers greatly improve their own vision systems, and process information in ways similar to how human drivers would.
Ford also noted their previously-annouced investment in Civil Maps to augment their 3D mapping capability. High-res 3D maps are a key ingredient in any full-fledged self-driving efforts.

Ford says it’s going to deliver self-driving cars by 2021 – and these will ship in volume, and will also lack steering wheels, brake or gas pedals, offering full Level 4 self-driving features which don’t require a human driver at all, the company announced at a press conference in Palo Alto today.
The car maker says that it has held off making any announcements about when to deliver self-driving vehicles until now because it isn’t in a race to make announcements. But it did say it is making self-driving vehicle deployment a priority, because of the advantages it offers in terms of customer experience and passenger safety.
“We’re no longer just an auto company, we’re also a mobility company,” said Ford CEO Mark Fields at the press conference. He made that declaration after discussing Ford Mobility Solutions, which is a subsidiary Ford began to help it develop automated fleet driving services.

Ford also announced it was going to ramp up its Silicon Valley operations, doubling its employee population in the tech center to over 300, with expanded offices and labs in Palo Alto.
While self-driving cars are planned for mass production by 2021, Ford doesn’t see these replacing personal transportation in five years’ time. Instead, the company anticipates these being used mostly in urban environments as supplements to mass transit, while individual car ownership will continue to focus on vehicles with driver assist functions, but which ultimately still give humans control.

974,Ford and Baidu put $150M behind LiDAR for self-driving cars,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/16/ford-and-baidu-put-150m-behind-lidar-for-self-driving-cars/,2016/08/16,"
Carmakers continue to look to the Valley for help paving the way for the future of cars – Ford has teamed up with Baidu to jointly invest $150 million in Velodyne, a company making LiDAR sensors in California’s technology hotspot. The money will help Velodyne quickly ramp up efforts to make its LiDAR sensors at scale while retaining and increasing quality, which will help carmakers build autonomous vehicles at scale, too.
Velodyne is no startup, though; the company has been working on LiDAR (Light, Detection and Ranging) tech since 2005, after entering the space from its original business, which was creating premium audio equipment, including subwoofers. Its transition to LiDAR proved effective, however, and it’s now one of the leaders in the market, as evidenced by Ford’s confidence with this investment.
Ford has worked with Velodyne before – in January of this year, the auto company ordered Velodyne’s driver assistance LiDAR sensor, which can support any kind of autonomy from level 1, or basic driver assistance, all the way to level 4, or full self-driving. The two companies also worked together on R&D for “much of” Ford’s history with autonomous driving tech, according to Velodyne, which spans more than a decade.
Baidu’s participation might be more unexpected, but the Chinese web search giant has its own autonomous driving unit, and is already testing a fleet of driverless vehicles in China. Baidu also has a Silicon Valley-based autonomous driving team. Ford and Baidu also teamed up as strategic partners in offering infotainment services to Chinese customers in 2013. Still, they’re looking more like competitors these days.
The race is on to achieve full self-driving autonomy, and a key ingredient in that will be affordable, scalable production of the requisite sensors. And that’s going to benefit everyone in the market, which is why the Baidu/Ford combination in this funding makes sense.

975,A first look at the Alta Motors all-electric-motorcycle factory,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/15/a-first-look-at-alta-motors-all-electric-motorcycle-factory/,2016/08/15," 



Motorcycle makers Alta Motors have opened the doors to their new factory in Brisbane, California, and TechCrunch was on the scene for a first look.
A quick trip from downtown San Francisco, the factory is in a low and unassuming concrete structure. Inside, it’s surprisingly quiet, thanks in part to the fact that the motorcycles Alta makes are all-electrics, and final assembly of these bikes is ultimately done by hand.
The startup’s flagship product, the Redshift MX, is a motocross bike newly shipping to dealers and retailing at $14,995.
The company also makes a street-legal version of this bike, the Redshift SM, which sells for $15,495.
Why build their own factory rather than outsource to markets known for motorcycle manufacturing, especially Japan, home of Yamaha and others?

Alta Motors’ CEO and co-founder Marc Fenigstein said, “Everything we’ve done in-house we’ve been able to do faster, cheaper and at higher output than outsourced. The hardest part is bringing up a supply chain that delivers all 460 parts that we need on time on quality and on cost.”
For the unfamiliar, Alta Motors, formerly known as BRD Motorcycles, is one of the electric vehicle makers that has managed not to burn out or fade away, while others like Mission Motors, Coda and Aptera shuttered, and Brammo and Fisker pivoted and retrenched.
Fenigstein said one thing that’s special about the company’s Redshift bike is that its battery carries 80 percent more range, per pound, than any other battery in motorcycles. The Redshift bikes accelerate from 0 to 60 in 3.3 seconds.
And in an environment where the tires are constantly gaining and losing traction, Redshift’s electric drive train and software offer riders a higher degree of control over their bikes’ movement than traditional, gasoline powered bikes, even the high-performance variety, the company claims.

With 50 full-time employees, Alta makes all the electronics that run their motorcycles, and the packaging that contains their batteries. They acquire battery cells, wheels, tires, brakes and suspension systems from other suppliers.
Their bikes’ batteries specifically weigh about 70 lbs. (30 kg) and have a capacity of 5.8 kilowatt hours, according to Alta Motors CTO and co-founder Derek Dorresteyn.
All-electric bikes don’t require the same maintenance as gasoline-powered bikes — including oil changes, air filter changes and frequent engine rebuilds — Dorresteyn noted.
That, and acceleration that’s comparable to or better than gas bikes, makes the Redshift appealing to riders who don’t want to spend as much time fixing things as riding or competing.

Within 3 years, Alta plans to be selling the Redshift, and other all-electric products, internationally.
That could make the San Francisco startup competitive with companies like Gogoro in China, as well as other U.S.-based electric-vehicle motorcycle makers like Zero Motorcycles and Harley-Davidson, which plans to release an electric bike, eventually.
Dorresteyn and Fenigstein declined to specify what other vehicles Alta may develop and when, but they said their technology could work in scooters and smaller motorcycles that are prolific globally.
Alta has raised $17.5 million in equity funding to date, with additional venture debt financing of $2 million.
The company counts among its advisors and angel backers Tesla’s original founder and battery tech inventor Martin Eberhard, and EnduroCross inventor and the man credited with getting flat-track motorcycle racing into the X Games, Eric Peronnard.

Imagine never having to stop for a red light again – Audi’s upcoming traffic light information system won’t get you all the way there, but it will help you stop with the guesswork around when a light is going to change from red to green.
The feature will provide a countdown of exactly when a traffic light will switch from stop to go, starting a few seconds before the change, based on data provided by city infrastructure. That means it’s limited to cities where such services are available, which includes a few major metropolitan areas I the U.S. currently. The Audi system gets its data from Traffic Technology Services, an info provider that connects the dots between city infrastructure and connected vehicles.
It’s also limited in terms of vehicles affected, with 2017 models including the Audi Q7, A4 and A4 all road with firm levels that include Audi connect being the only ones that can take advantage of the feature. Plus, it’s a pay service rolled into the Connect Prime subscription offering Audi provides. But despite its limited scope and scale, it is indeed an industry first, and one that will hopefully pave the way for deeper future integrations between smart city infrastructure and connected cars.
Similar solutions are available as third-party apps for your smartphone, including EnLighten, an app that sounds audible alerts when a traffic light is about to change. Audi’s system sounds like it might be more closely tied to official city traffic light servers, however.
Audi and EnLighten offer similar motivation for making traffic light advance warning info available to drivers: to diminish driver stress. I’m still curious to see how this performs as a directly integrated OEM offering on cars, in terms of alleviating distractions and stress.

977,iTank: “A three-wheeled scooter is the future”,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/11/itank-a-three-wheeled-scooter-is-the-future/,2016/08/11,"
The Kickstarter campaign for the Doohan EV3 iTank three-wheeled scooter began this week. It’s brought to you by Kartik Ram, the same guy behind the Zeitgeist electric bike that debuted this spring.
Before we get into the question of whether a three-wheeled scooter really is the future, as Ram said in a phone interview, here are the details of the iTank:

Bosch motor goes from 0-28 mph in 4.6 seconds (the top speed is limited)
Removable lithium-ion batteries fully charge in 6 hours
Range of 62 miles (official) or 100 miles (according to Ram)
50:50 weight balance and low center of gravity

“It’s not a scooter, and it’s not a motorcycle,” said Ram. The iTank is meant to take on neighborhood cruising, light trails and places where people don’t want to use their car but they don’t want to walk, either, like marinas, RV sites and golf courses. It’s able to climb a 15-degree incline without losing power, but “I wouldn’t take it off-road and climb rocks with it,” Ram said.
Amazon has placed a sizable order through Launchpad (it’s already available on Amazon Prime), and Ram is pursuing relationships with police departments, private security agencies and businesses like Camping World. “Where Segway failed, we can do that,” he said.
But the iTank’s Kickstarter early-bird price is not cheap at $4,000; the Amazon purchase order, Ram said, was for the full retail price of $5,500 per scooter. “As three-wheeled scooters go, it’s extremely cheap,” Ram said — and he’s not wrong. The Piaggio MP3 Sport 500 is $9,000, and that’s where the U.S. market pretty much ends. There are far-more-powerful trike motorcycles, like the Harley-Davidson Freewheeler, that start at $25,000, but that hardly compares to a scooter that goes 28 mph.
What keeps the iTank from being just a toy for people tooling around the marina? “I believe this is the architecture of the future,” Ram said. “Cars are getting smarter and smaller. In general, the sharing economy requires you to think about smaller form factors that are personal for you. But two wheels aren’t right; I can’t tell my mom, who’s in her 70s, to ride a scooter. And four wheels signal cars or golf carts; it seems heavy.”
Ram noted that scooters are cultural for a lot of people in India and Europe, and a quick search on China’s massive e-commerce site Alibaba for “three wheels moped” turned up more than 1,000 results. Ram senses that scooters are perceived as being too dangerous in America. “I think little fiddly scooters aren’t going to cut it. You need something stable.”
And so, on the heels of a well-designed electric bike, he’s introducing a well-designed three-wheeled electric scooter. “A three-wheeled scooter is the future,” he said. “I truly believe this is going to be the urban mobility future: interesting personal vehicles that can carry stuff. I’m totally committed to this architecture for the next 10 years.”

978,Tesla’s Autopilot 2.0 said to add triple camera system and more radar,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/11/teslas-autopilot-2-0-said-to-add-triple-camera-system-and-more-radar/,2016/08/11,"
Tesla’s Autopilot is set to get a major update soon, according to multiple reports, and a new one from Electrek details some of the new hardware improvements that will pave the way for its arrival. The autonomous driving assistant for Tesla vehicles will benefit from a new front-facing triple camera array, Elecktrek reports, and will also add additional radar around the car, to supplement the forward oriented radar used in current models.
Tesla is already installing the new three-camera system housing in cars, according to the report, and the radar detail fits with previous info Elon Musk has dropped on Twitter about using radar in place of lidar to achieve lidar-like effects. New radar in each corner of the car would help with Musk’s goal of using radar to create a point cloud similar to the one used in lidar systems.
New hardware will start out running current Autopilot software, the report claims, and will then add features over time based on improvements generated from additional data gathered through use of Autopilot 1.0 with the new equipment. Electrek points out that while Autopilot can and does use live data, it also leans a lot of GPS data and its own “high precision maps” built from data collected across the entire fleet of vehicles, which will be better informed though vehicles equipped with the new hardware array.
While there’s no timeline for Autopilot 2.0’s introduction, Elon Musk has teased that very big improvements to its self-driving tech are on the way. On the company’s most recent earnings call, the Tesla CEO said that “what [they’ve] got will blow people’s minds,” and that “it’ll come sooner than people think.” He added that since the tech “blows [him] away, it’s really going to blow away other people, too, when they see it for the first time.”

BMW isn’t letting off the gas on its electric vehicle program – the company plans replacements for the i3 and i8 by 2022, according to Automobile Magazine, and a new entrant dubbed Project i20 internally (but likely to be known as the i5 or i6 when it hits streets) on track for 2021. The i20 has a fully electric drivetrain, like the i3 before it, and will also offer BMW’s most sophisticated autonomous driving features to date.
The i20 will have multiple drivetrain options, ranging from 136 hp at the low end, to a powerful 247 hp at the top. Automobile describes it as a “bigger, prettier, and more aerodynamic i3,” which should go over well with potential BMW electric buyers, since the i3’s design is fairly divisive overall (I love the little guy, personally).
But the bigger news might be the self-driving features. There aren’t any details about what’s planned for the i20 initially beyond that it’ll have “advanced autonomous” features, but the report claims a fully self-driving version is planned for a debut in 2025.
The i3 updates planed for 2022 include a number of different proposals currently in consideration, including one design that uses the current carbon-fiber body build, one with an all-aluminum chassis, and a final version with a blend of a number of different materials.
The i8’s update, which the magazine says could slip to 2023, looks like will abandon the current hybrid design and opt for an all-electric three-motor, 750 hp drivetrain with batteries boasting a 300 mile driving range.
These all sound like solid additions to BMW’s EV lineup, but the i20 is probably the most intriguing, both because we’ll get to see it before the others if the roadmap stays true, and because of its self-driving capabilities. Plus, it sounds like it might try to thread the needle between the two extremes of the i3 and the i8, which could put it squarely in competition with the likes of the Tesla Model S.

980,LeEco plans to build a $1.8 billion plant to take on Tesla,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/11/leplant/,2016/08/11,"
LeEco’s not just messing around with this whole electric car deal. Back in April, the Chinese electronics company best known for its TVs and smartphone (once named LeTV, if that rings more bells) carted out its self-driving concept car during a big phone unveil in Beijing. The decidedly futuristic LeSEE (pronounced like “lessee”) features a foldaway steering wheel, exterior display on the front of the car and is capable of hitting top speeds of 130 MPH.
But the company’s auto-making dreams look to be more than just conceptual. LeEco is putting $1.8 billion of its money where its mouth is, announcing plans this week to up break ground on an electric car factory outside Hangzhou, China capable of producing 400,000 vehicles annually.
The plant will be part of LeEco’s larger planned “Eco Experience Park,” a $3 billion project that sounds like a veritable Disneyland of electric auto production, featuring an entertainment park in addition to all of the boring offices and car manufacturing facilities.
That announced Chinese plant comes in addition to an announced partnership with Faraday Future that will produce some of the EVs in the US-based company’s Las Vegas production facility, part of an on-going partnership between the two companies.

981,"Karma Revero hybrid electric sports car revealed, complete with solar roof",https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/11/karma-revero-hybrid-electric-sports-car-revealed-complete-with-solar-roof/,2016/08/11,"
The Fisker Karma is back, reborn as the Karma Revero, with a familiar look, along with a new name and some design tweaks and feature additions that mark a departure from its origins. Today marks the first time we’ve seen the Revero, revealed via images shared by Karma detailing the car’s exterior, as well as its unique solar roof and redesigned infotainment system.
Karma is a car company with a lot to prove: The Southern California-based automaker rose from the ashes of Fisker, an electric pioneer in the plug-in hybrid sports vehicle market that, early on, looked poised to potentially compete with Tesla. Fisker burned through cash quickly, though, and earned a reputation for far too firey mechanical failures. Fisker went bankrupt in 2013, but Chinese auto part supplier Wanxiang acquired the assets, installed new leadership and are in the process of relaunching the company as Karma, the name of Fisker’s original flagship car.
The Karma Revero is a lot like the Fisker in terms of general appearance, with the same stunning curves you might expect from an English sports car (original designer Henrik Fisker did design the Aston Martin DB9, after all). And the design of the original was basically universally loved by critics and fans, so keeping the aesthetic is probably smart.

Karma is emphasizing changes to the tech within, however, to distance itself from the shortcomings of its previous existence. There’s a brand new infotainment system, for instance, which the company called “simple, intuitive and beautiful.” Karma seems possibly to be taking a potshot at Tesla regarding the dash display, noting that “if you like a 200 page supplement to the owner’s manual,” just to operate it, you should look elsewhere.
Another feature Karma is highlighting in this early tease (the full reveal happens on September 8) is its roof, which features integrated solar panels the company says can “power the vehicle.” We’ll have to see what exactly that entails once the full specs are announced.
Karma’s Revero is a very good-looking car, with design chops that should indeed merit the $100,000 starting price tag the vehicle will carry. But the key ingredient here was always going to be performance, and for that we’ll have to wait and see what Karma delivers.

982,Toyota Research Institute provides $22M to University of Michigan for AI studies,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/10/toyota-research-institute-provides-22m-to-university-of-michigan-for-ai-studies/,2016/08/10,"
Toyota Research Institute (TRI), a Toyota R&D organization headquartered in Silicon Valley, is providing $22 million over four years in an initial research grant with the University of Michigan. The funding follows Toyota’s opening of a third research facility for TRI at the U of M campus, which it officially announced in April this year.
The funding is earmarked for artificial intelligence research specifically, and follows similar investments and facilities at Stanford near the Institute’s Palo Alto HQ, and in Cambridge, where Toyota has a similar research agreement with MIT.
Toyota isn’t new to U of M; the car-maker has two Toyota Technical Centers near the academic institution, and it has worked with faculty there on connected cars and research into advanced safety measures. Toyota is also a founding member of the university’s Mobility Transformation Center, which is a multi-departmental effort focused on building future transportation systems that incorporate shared autonomous vehicle networks.
This new investment from Toyota is yet another clear sign that the automaker is looking to drive R&D advances in robotics, machine learning and artificial intelligence through close relationships with top academics in the field. The University of Michigan is one of the top graduate schools in the country for AI studies, according to many top schools listings, and it’s also a key North American research center for automotive tech.
The money isn’t just going towards car research, however; the University also says it’ll be used in studies related to “partner robotics,” “indoor mobility” and “student learning and diversity,” in addition to car tech.
Interest from car companies in academic research to spur innovation is coming from all the major manufacturers, including Ford, U of M’s nearby neighbor. The increased pace of development, aided by new entrants to the market including Google and potentially, Apple, means we’ll likely see more research partnership and further extensions of exiting ones for at least the next few years.

983,"Soon, you’ll be able to lock your BMW’s doors with your Amazon Echo",https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/10/soon-youll-be-able-to-lock-your-bmws-doors-with-your-amazon-echo/,2016/08/10,"
BMW is working on an Alexa skill for its new BMW Connected app, which will arrive later this year and let car owners do things like check their remaining fuel levels and lock their car doors via voice commands to their Echo speaker.
The new BMW Connected app arrived in the North American App Store in April, and will roll out in the UK.  It’s able to connect to any car with “ConnectedDrive Services,” a feature introduced as a standard option by the car maker on all vehicles made from January 2016. BMW says that means there are about 400,000 vehicles on the road that can make use of the features in the UK alone. The updated app is an overhaul of a previous version that’s designed to be a more full-featured driving assistant, with trip management features including notifications indicating when you should leave to make it to your destination on time.
The revamped app sounds interesting, but the bigger story here is one that BMW buried near the bottom of the press release:
Later this year users will also be able to access BMW Connected via an Alexa skill for Amazon Echo, enabling them to get vehicle status like remaining range and execute remote commands like ‘door lock’, all through voice interaction.
Amazon’s Echo-based assistant adds new integrations every day, but the BMW app connection will let it extend further beyond the home. Ford has an early lead with Echo integration, letting people start their car and check range via Alexa.
Other more DIY solutions to add car control to Alexa’s list of skills exist, but BMW’s move here gives hope to drivers everywhere looking for closer connections between their vehicles and their smart home setups.
It’s still not Alexa in the car, which is something I’ve said previously I think would be a good fit. But it’s at least a relationship, and an acknowledgement that voice-based interaction is a useful model for controlling basic car functions.

984,Auto manufacturers need stable startup partners,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/09/auto-manufacturers-need-stable-startup-partners/,2016/08/09,"
TU-Automotive, which analyzes the future of the connected, autonomous car, recently hosted a webinar focused on the relationship between automotive manufacturers and startups. SK Kim, venture capitalist and manager at Hyundai Ventures, and Liz Kerton, executive director of the Autotech Council, laid out the challenges of mashing together a century-old industry with nimble new companies.
As Kim said, “We have a hundred-year-old business model, and we sell one thing: vehicles.” Startups are using business models that evolve on the fly to respond to the market and their internal needs, and the number of things they could sell are limited only by their imaginations and missions.
Therein lies the first challenge: the nimbleness that allows startups to function in the fast-paced twenty-first century is seen as instability by the automotive behemoths. “[Automotive manufacturers] need to find companies stable enough and with enough investment to make it through the product development cycle with a car company, which everybody knows is not short,” Kerton said.
Having just a year or two’s worth of funding isn’t enough, she added, since it takes longer than that just to get a car from drawing board to showroom. Kim noted that it can take five to seven years to develop a car, where it only takes a year to develop a phone and a few weeks or months to develop an app. Then there’s the fact that once those cars roll out of the showroom, they might be on the road for twenty years. “You don’t want your technology partner to drop off,” Kerton said.
Kim acknowledged that startups expect fast decisions on equity investment and contracts for early revenue. “That’s the only way for them to survive,” he said. But the challenge of connecting the cautious, slow pace of automotive investing and developing with the timeline startups expect is “frustrating in both directions,” Kim said.
So why on earth would an old-school automotive company want to work with an upstart, er, startup? Kim had three good reasons: car companies need technology partners to innovate, business partners that can instill some flexibility, and partners that are unafraid to explore the uncertain and unpredictable future of transportation. Making bold moves is not exactly the forte of major automotive manufacturers.
“Automaking is a highly regulated business with a highly regulated product,” Kim said. For this reason, it’s risky for a startup to focus only on the auto industry as a market or potential partner for its products. Kim suggested that it would be better for a startup to develop something for another space and then expand into the automotive space. That strategy makes a partnership, when it does happen, less risky for both companies.

GM is putting its Cruise acquisition to good use in Arizona: The self-driving car startup acquired by the automaker in March is trialling its tech on public roads in Scottsdale. Cruise tweeted about the autonomous testing expansion, which uses Chevrolet Bolt all-electric vehicles, and which adds to the core fleet of testing vehicles already operating in San Francisco.

Cruise’s self-driving Bolt hit San Francisco streets in May, but provided few details beyond acknowledging that it was doing testing. GM has aggressive goals in terms of productizing its Cruise acquisition, however: The Wall Street Journal reported that GM hopes to put self-driving taxis into usage tests in partnership with Lyft “within a year.”
Scottsdale makes sense for a field test, since the area already plays host to Google self-driving cars, and the state has strong regulatory support for self-driving vehicle tests in general. GM’s Innovation Center is also based in nearby Chandler.
GM confirmed the Arizona tests but isn’t providing any more information about this time.

986,Lyft now lets riders add an extra stop to their trips,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/08/lyft-now-lets-riders-add-an-extra-stop-to-their-trips/,2016/08/08,"
Lyft is giving riders a way to make a multi-stop trip, letting them use the Lyft app to add an extra destination for two-stop trips. The logic is simple: With more users, especially city-dwellers, tapping ride-sharing and on-demand services in place of owning a vehicle, it’s more likely they’ll want some flexibility in how those trips are routed, since a multi-errand excursion is a pretty common occurrence for most.
Adding a side-trip is easy enough: You put your first stop in as the destination when requesting your ride, and then tap a new “+” icon next to the destination to add a final drop-off location. The driver will be able to see both stops on their end, and you won’t need to awkwardly mumble that it’s “5 o’clock somewhere” when explaining why you want to hit the liquor store before heading home at 11 in the morning. Of course, you can also do other, more socially acceptable things like dropping off a friend when sharing a trip, or picking up some groceries on the way home.
Lyft will also let you change your mind and remove the stop if you decide against whatever it was you were going to do. All of which sounds very convenient, which is nice, but Lyft is looking to optimize its service by acting on actual data in adding this feature, which isn’t currently offered by its largest competitor Uber.

Most riders do input a destination, Lyft has found, including in 90 percent of Classic, Plus and Premier rides booked. Five percent of those end up being manually updated during the ride, which actually translates to hundreds of thousands of instances of manual multi-stop tripping, so it’s definitely a non-trivial user need. And for fare-splitters, this marries up nicely with the existing ability to divvy up ride costs.
But it’s also a service for drivers – Lyft allows drivers nearing the end of a trip to be matched up with passengers nearby before the trip actually concludes to help them earn more by chaining fares. A last-minute destination change can be frustrating for both drivers and passengers, but now multi-destination helps in driver planning and in avoiding the downsides of queuing close proximity rides.
The ability to add a stop will roll out to Lyft’s mobile apps soon. It’s a small but smart addition, and one that could also easily translate into a core component of a more automated ride-sharing interaction model in the future.

987,Innoviz takes $9M to put the squeeze on solid state Lidar,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/08/innoviz-takes-9m-to-put-the-squeeze-on-solid-state-lidar/,2016/08/08,"
The accelerating drive to get autonomous cars on the road is being accompanied by a parallel push to improve Lidar technology, aka the 3D laser-based sensors that can be used for real-time mapping and navigation for vision systems in driverless cars.
Shrinking Lidar sensors, engineering out moving parts to beef up robustness and squeezing the per unit cost are seen as key steps to pave the way for volume production of commercial driverless cars.
MIT and Darpa are even working on Lidar on a chip, which they claim could shrink costs to $10 per sensor in future and allow for sensors to be housed on robots’ fingertips in future. But we’re not there yet.
Israeli startup Innoviz Technologies, founded earlier this year, is a new entrant in the space, coming out of stealth today to announce a $9 million Series A funding round (closed in February), with the aim of getting a prototype of its solid state Lidar completed and demoed publicly by the end of this year (they claim it’s working internally at this nascent stage).
They’re penciling in a timeframe of mid-2018 for a mass production ready product.
Early this year another startup, US-based Quanergy, announced its forthcoming solid state Lidor would cost $250 or less at volume production levels. Although it’s not yet in the market, with the company previously aiming to have a preproduction version of the sensor ready by this September, and penciling in delivery to OEMs in early 2017.
Innoviz says it’s aiming for a price-point below $100 for its solid state Lidar (also, it confirms, at volume production levels) — by reducing components to shrink costs. Size wise, they reckon they can get it smaller than 5cm x 5cm x 5cm. Although they are also not disclosing any details about their core tech at this point, saying only that they took “a different technical approach” to the scanning element of Lidar vs Quanergy and MIT.
Beyond developing their prototype, and slating an enhanced performance/cost version for the middle of next year, Innoviz is spending to expand its team to develop complementary products for the hardware — including software for mapping and localization, object detection and tracking and sensor fusion.
Investors in its Series A include entrepreneur and co-founder Zohar Zisapel, along with Israeli VC firms Vertex Venture Capital, Magma Venture Partners, Amiti Ventures and local car retail company Delek Motors.

Wanxiang Group, which acquired the assets of plug-in hybrid pioneer Fisker and renamed it Karma Automotive, is planning a large-scale $375 million electric car factory with an output capacity of 50,000 vehicles per year, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Karma Automotive also revealed its distribution model for the Revero plug-in hybrid it plans to release later this year, with a big reveal planned for September 8.
In 2014, Wanxiang acquired Fisker Automotive out of bankruptcy and gave it the backing needed to resume operations, but switched the company’s brand to that of its first product: The Karma, which got a debut at the North American Auto Show in 2008 but only ever achieved a total production run of 2,450 over the course of its existence. The renamed Karma also got new management, and a new California-based production site to go with the new owner.
Karma’s Revero will be its first production vehicle following these shifts, with a $100,000 starting price tag and a launch window of “later this year.” The Souther California-based company revealed its launch distribution plans today, including use of licensed third-party luxury car deals, and its own “Experience Center” direct sales locations.

Potential Revero customers will be able to shop Karma’s offerings in Atlanta, Chicago, Ft. Worth, Miami, Palm Beach, Pasadena, Philadelphia, Detroit, Montreal and Toronto when the go on sale, all at high-end third-party dealerships that also stock cars from companies including Lamborghini, McClaren, Porsche and others.
Karma’s owned sales facilities will offer a much more brand-specific sales experience, and the first of these is planned for Orange County. This will provide the setting for the initial Revero reveal in September, too.
Wanxiang’s application filing detailing its upcoming China-based electric vehicle factory includes confirmation that it will be producing vehicles based on the vehicle platforms it acquired from Fisker, including the Karma and Atlantic, a two-door sport coupe. Wanxiang currently only manufactures car parts, but is hoping to receive approval from the Chinese government to expand into full car production with this new factor proposal.

989,Autopilot in Tesla Model X helps driver get safely to a hospital,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/07/autopilot-in-tesla-model-x-helps-driver-get-safely-to-a-hospital/,2016/08/07,"
A Missouri man might not have made it safely to the hospital without the aid of his Tesla Model X’s self-driving features (via Slate). Joshua Neally, the 37-year old Model X owner, was on the way home from his law firm after work when he was struck by a pulmonary embolism. Neally allowed the Autopilot system to take over for 20 miles of highway driving, which brought the vehicle and its driver to an off-ramp close to a hospital, where he was able to finish the trip.
Tesla’s Autopilot system may be under scrutiny after an accident in Florida earlier this year resulted in a driver death, but this is an example of where it definitely helped the operator of the vehicle. The obvious question that comes to mind is whether it would’ve been safer on the whole for Neally to pull over and call an ambulance instead of relying on his own car’s self-driving features, since Neally admits he didn’t “remember much of the drive” after his embolism began.
But whether or not Neally made the right call in continuing to drive himself, it proves the importance and necessity of offering safety features like Autopilot: In clutch situations like a medical emergency where we feel like our life is on the line, very few people can be relied upon to make the sane, logical and most conscientious choice about our actions.
Neally told Branson local NBC affiliate KY3 that he “just knew [he] had to get [to the ER]” once he began feeling the symptoms of the pulmonary embolism – in other words, he was essentially panicking and his instinct kicked in, convincing his brain the best course of action was to get to the hospital as quickly as possible.
Continuing to drive while under extreme physical duress might not have been the best choice, but it was the human one, and that’s what makes Autopilot’s role in getting Neally to the hospital in one piece so poignant. Plus, the fact that Neally had a choice at all is a chance outcome of the severity of the embolism: If it had been something more severe, and he wasn’t able physically to continue driving or make a decision, Autopilot would’ve engaged its failsafe mode, which decelerates the vehicle, turns on the four-way hazard lights and slowly moves the car to the roadside.
You can argue about whether or not a driver in this situation is more or less likely to continue driving rather than pull over and call an ambulance since the system is present to begin with, but you can also debate whether allowing Autopilot to drive was more or less safe than other options. What you can’t argue is that people will always make the most rational and informed decision when their life feels immediately threatened, and that’s where autonomous technologies stand to make the most impact.

The Future Of Retail Won’t Be So Good For Consumers




Driverless cars and ridesharing are poised to bring about the next big tectonic movement that technology provides for the human experience. In much the same way that the mobile phone has transformed the way we live, autonomous vehicles and transportation sharing promise to change the way we move.
Tesla’s recent announcement of its Master Plan, Part Deux exemplifies the convergence of these technology trends. For Tesla, this is a natural evolution for the business that makes complete sense.
There are many hurdles to overcome, but as these technologies develop, local and federal regulations may be the largest. Tesla’s plan believes that proper testing will require approximately 6 billion miles (10 billion kilometers) in testing before worldwide regulatory approval will be achieved.
There is little doubt that cars will reach a level of self-driving competence at some point. However, what driverless, shared vehicles mean and how they become adapted into today’s infrastructure could create problems as governments wrestle with existing infrastructure and deeply entrenched financial interests.

The PC evolution, the internet, the switch from cell phone to smartphone, tablets and laptops — these are a few of the examples of profound introductions of new technology to our society that have managed to cause evolutionary changes in our lives.
Now both driverless vehicles and ridesharing can be added to the list. Auto manufacturers are already experimenting with and making investments into these capabilities: GM recently invested $500 million in Lyft, with Toyota following suit in Uber and VW investing $300 million in Gett, a Tel Aviv-based ridehailing startup that operates in dozens of cities across Europe. The race is on.
Mary Meeker, in her recent state of the technology industry presentation, devoted a few slides to the intersection of ridesharing and autonomy.
The benefits of rideshare and driverless cars working together seem to far outweigh excuses to stay with the status quo.
“Google wants to leapfrog straight to fully self-driving cars, which could take a while, Tesla wants to iterate its way there despite the risks of semi-autonomy and traditional car makers are combining the approaches while making strategic investments in ride-sharing startups… UberPool has succeeded in de-stigmatizing car sharing, and could achieve mass adoption as the time saved offsets the slightly higher cost compared to public transportation… Fascinating questions to debate about how transportation will change as autonomy makes cars into mobile living rooms.”
The writing is on the wall
The benefits of rideshare and driverless cars working together seem to far outweigh excuses to stay with the status quo. With the high costs of owning a vehicle, reduced interest in driving and potential revenue opportunities by sending your car out to earn income via rideshare, the new model feels overwhelmingly compelling. As outlined by Meeker’s slide:
“Car ownership will wane as its high costs and inefficiency give way to ride sharing.” As vehicles get into the market of being driverless-ready, rideshare companies provide an interesting option for owners of these vehicles.
Although we are not quite there yet, solving the technology challenges that will enable this new phase will eventually happen. The revenue opportunity is too great and will drive the innovation to commercialize as quickly as possible.
Right now, most of the talk and focus has been on gaining acceptance by government regulators, mostly to do with security and safety concerns. “U.S. regulators are embracing self-driving cars faster than tech in the past, poising the nation for gains from the auto industry shift.”
Knee-jerk reactions now could create large pileups down the road.
Still… there have been significant, and tragic, accidents that may slow the adoption of autonomous technologies. With the death of a Tesla driver using autopilot in Florida on May 7, 2016, government regulators may be forced to be more circumspect in their attitudes on how this technology progresses. To further add concern, another recently crashed Tesla on autopilot certainly won’t help government speed regulation.
Technology always evolves far faster than governments can keep up with. And as autonomous vehicles merge into the fast lane, understanding how they influence economies will be critical. Knee-jerk reactions now could create large pileups down the road.
The local government conundrum
Real-life examples of governments wrestling with ridesharing services are evident already. Take a look at Austin, where recent intervention by the city’s government prompted Lyft and Uber to pull out of what had been a successful area for them.
Some local governments have banded together to come up with solutions on how to best handle how rideshare companies integrate with their cities. From New York and Toronto to Athens and Barcelona, mayors are forging alliances to deal with the changing situation.
By combining ridesharing and driverless cars, companies are creating the potential for even more pressing issues for local governments on the horizon.
The driverless car and rideshare mashup won’t be easy
With increasing populations and aging infrastructure, the cost of road maintenance and public transportation infrastructure seems to increase every year. The typical strategy has been to offload those additional costs through taxes on things such as gas, parking, insurance payments, tolls or even pay-per-mileage recently introduced in Oregon.
Driverless cars and rideshare have the potential to significantly reduce cars on the road and negatively impact revenues needed to support local transportation infrastructure.
As owners of cars look to contract out their vehicles for usage in rideshare services to help support the cost of ownership, you’ll see fewer vehicles on the road. With EVs, hybrids and more fuel-efficient vehicles, fuel taxes are also at risk for decline.
The government is in total control of when and how these new technologies get introduced.
Increased carpooling will also impact a reduction in the use of public transportation. Reduced parking and toll revenue will combine with the aspects noted above, and will jeopardize the amount of money that’s collected and needed to support local infrastructure.
If driverless cars and ridesharing are going to be the next big thing, local governments need to look for ways to secure, grow and sustain revenue for the future. This dilemma potentially creates a barrier to the widespread adoption that would change the way we live.
On one hand, you’ve got a technological and cultural shift about to happen, but from a tax point of view, governments will create a problem for themselves by supporting this change.
Despite doing what’s right for people and the environment, we don’t always see that playing out in economics. Uber isn’t accepted everywhere because it threatens local regulated, revenue-generating taxi services, even though it’s a great service for consumers. Meanwhile, people in communities where rideshare is restricted continue to pay higher prices to own vehicles. Until this problem is solved, you’ve got some local governments unwilling to move.
Weave into that driverless cars, and you have government’s seemingly working against themselves — if they aren’t careful, they’ll legislate themselves into a deficit.
The government is in total control of when and how these new technologies get introduced.
Maybe they’ll decide to de-couple the rideshare from the driverless car, where people could still own driverless cars, but not use them to subcontract for rideshare services. Then you’ve got to restrict rideshare companies from owning their own vehicles now or face the same problem. Big decisions fraught with peril become evident from many angles.

The overwhelming benefits will ultimately see driverless cars adopted everywhere. And those cities that restrict rideshare will be faced with even more questions by local residents critical of the decision that blocks communities from the inherent benefits.
Governments will have to come up with different ways to pay for the system they’ve built, but their revenue requirements won’t go away. Perhaps driverless busses will reduce the costs of transportation. Parking fees could be recovered by mileage tax, or charging drop-off and pick-up fees for rideshare trips. Maybe you’ll see chargeable driverless car “waiting areas” pop up. Or insurance cost-savings created by a decline in accidents could be offset by higher taxes underneath the noses of the consumers.
One thing is for sure, these revenues will have to be made up somewhere. The question is where? With these questions still open, and a whole bunch of change coming, governments will soon be in No Man’s Land.

991,Google’s self-driving car CTO departs the project,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/05/googles-self-driving-car-cto-departs-the-project/,2016/08/05,"
Google’s self-driving car project is losing Chris Urmson, who served as the unit’s CTO and lead technical resource after going the company from Carnegie Mellon. Urmson has considerable status among roboticist in the world of autonomous vehicles, but said in a Medium post announcing his departure that he was “ready for a fresh challenge,” without specifying what exactly he’s doing next.
Urmson called being part of the project “a tremendous privilege and honor,” and said he has “every confidence act the mission” of building a fully self-driving car at Google is in “capable hands.”
He isn’t the only member of that team to depart recently, however: The New York Times reports that two other engineers on the project, Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu, who work specifically on machine vision tech, have also left, with the specific aim of building a new, still stealth startup.
The move comes just a day after Google self-driving car unit CEO John Krafcik spoke to Bloomberg about the project. Krafcik spoke about the team’s makeup in his interview, saying it contained ” a surprising number of car geeks,” and that the group included “a lot of hard-core software-coding types as well.”
Krafcik joined Google in September 2015 from Hyundai, where he was CEO and President of the company’s U.S. operation.

992,"Mercedes-Benz said to plan EV sub-brand, with multiple SUVs and sedans",https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/05/mercedes-electric-car-plans/,2016/08/05,"
Mercedes-Benz isn’t just planning one or two all-electric vehicle options to woo customers away from competitors, including BMW and Tesla who are further along with their EV lineups — it has four models in the works, according to sources speaking to Bloomberg. These cars will be offered under a new sub-brand with a new name, per the report.
The first of these will likely come at the Paris Motor Show, which happens in October, and at which Mercedes-Benz CEO Dieter Zetsche has also promised an electric vehicle from the company will be revealed. But Bloomberg says the lineup will include two electric SUVs and two electric sedans, which are currently set to go to market by 2020. The first, which is the one that we’ll apparently see at the Paris show, will be an SUV, with an impressive max range of about 500 km (310 miles) on one charge.
This prototype vehicle, if it indeed boasts that kind of range in addition to the cargo capacity advantages of a sport utility, would have a lot of potential among EV competitors. Tesla’s Model X, which is the closest production vehicle comparable to what it sounds like Mercedes is going to reveal, notably hits the exact same max range when the 250-257 mile on the P90 and P90D variants is translated into the European testing method.
Of course, there are a lot of caveats there, not least of which is that the Mercedes truck doesn’t actually exist yet, while Tesla is shipping Model X units to customers. We also don’t know much about the German automaker’s consumer plans beyond what Bloomberg is reporting – though the results of its efforts in transport trucks is a promising sign it has its legs underneath it when it comes to electric drivetrains and battery tech.
Mercedes has the hybrid E-Class and the electric drive option B-Class in terms of existing electric vehicles, but the B-Class boasts a max range of just 87 miles, so it’s not exactly a Model S killer. In general, more EV competition in the consumer space is good for the entire market, so here’s hoping Mercedes does indeed have some strong offerings that actually hit the roads over the next few years.

993,Nissan’s working BladeGlider sport EV prototype calls to car lovers,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/04/nissan-bladeglider-ev-sports-car/,2016/08/04,"

Nissan is bringing a working version of the BladeGlider all-electric sport concept it first revealed in 2013 to Rio to ride the hype wave of the Olympics. The car is cool enough to merit hype in its own right, as a performance-engineered zero emission EV from a company that typically stays in the more conservative end of the market with staid offerings like the Nissan Leaf.
Now, first, let me preface what I’m about to say by acknowledging that the BladeGlider is indeed cool, as a car, as something that looks like a convincing set piece from a Luc Besson sci-fi epic, and as an engineering project. It’s a technological feat that many engineers and designers clearly put a lot of time and effort into.
But I find it very hard to ignore that the name “BladeGlider,” along with its two color options of “Cyber Green” and “Stealth Orange,” make it sound like the product we’re talking about here is actually the latest 5-bladed, garishly colored razor monstrosity from Gillette or Schick.
Okay, branding aside, this “EV for car lovers,” as it’s described by Daniele Shillaci, Executive Vice President of Global Marketing and Sales at Nissan, is genuinely interesting as a fully functioning example of where the automaker sees the performance end of the EV market heading.

It definitely looks race track-inspired, with a narrow nose and a wider back Nissan says provide “aerodynamic efficiency” and more stable handling, plus there’s wonderfully absurd rear-hinged doors Nissan freely admits is aimed at generating dramatic effect.
The powertrain comes from the U.K.’s Williams Advanced Engineering, and demo models can exceed 190km/h (around 115mph) with a zero to sixty time of less than five seconds in testing. It’s the motors on each of its real wheels that provide that propulsion generate a combined 268 hp, which is a lot for the relatively light 2,866-pound vehicle.

Tesla misses Q2 earnings, delivers 14,402 vehicles

Nissan didn’t just go bare-bones on the interior, either; the roof is open to give you the feeling of being connected to the road, and the race-style seats with four-point harnesses provide room for a driver and two offset passengers behind them. The dashboard is simple and clean, but still offers three monitors to keep an eye on things, including a central display offering real-time data from the car, with the flanking screens showing feeds from rear-view cameras seated behind the front wheels.
I can forgive Nissan the trespasses of the razor naming conventions, since the razor industry basically lifted that macho garbage from the auto industry to begin with. And since we could use more cars like the BMW i8 and Model S that push the limits of what we think of as high-end EV, it’s nice to see Nissan push this one past the concept stage and into something drivable.

994,Nissan says EV chargers will outnumber gas stations in the UK by 2020,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/04/nissan-says-ev-chargers-will-outnumber-gas-stations-in-the-uk-by-2020/,2016/08/04,"
A new study by car maker Nissan predicts the U.K. will have more electric vehicle charging locations than gas stations by 2020. It’s a bold prediction to estimate that EV chargers will outnumber places to gas up in just four short years, but Nissan is counting on both a continued decline in the number of operational gas stations, as well as new charge points coming online.
The attrition rate for gas stations in the U.K. is high: Nissan found that more than 75 percent of those operational four decades ago have closed and not been replaced, leaving a total of just 8,472 in the country (from a high-water mark of 37,539 in 1970). Following that curve, the car maker guesses that by 2020, the number will have dropped to 7,870.
Chargers are on the rise, however, and while currently, the U.K. boasts only 4,100 locations, its rate of growth is such that it should hit 7,900 charging spots in the next four years. Electric car registration is also growing at a rapid clip: A joint government and car maker campaign to promote low emission vehicles found that in the beginning months of 2016, a new electric car was registered every 13 minutes, on average.
Now Nissan has reason to hype the growth of EV infrastructure: It claims the honor of being the first to market with a “mass-produced electric vehicle” (the LEAF) and continues to push its all-electric cars as an ideal solution for U.K. urban commuters.
But even if Nissan has a clear interest in the market, its optimism is something that others can probably get behind. If the pace of EV infrastructure support is truly not on the rise, even if primarily in markets like the U.K. where the average driver isn’t worried about range anxiety on long trips, that’s something to celebrate.

Tesla missed its Q2 earnings targets today in a report released after the close of the market. Tesla executives are not wavering on yearly targets, despite a slower than expected quarter. All of this comes amidst a seemingly never-ending wave of Tesla headlines dominating Silicon Valley over the last few weeks.
The energy company born out of an automobile company reported non-GAAP Q2 revenue of $1.56 billion up from last year’s Q2 revenue of $1.2 billion. The company came close but ultimately missed analyst estimates of $1.6 billion.
Tesla closed down 0.62 percent today at $225.79. After the news was released, Tesla shares moved up almost instantly in after-hours trading after the news dropped but have been fluctuating up and down by 2 percent since.

Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) Stock Price | FindTheCompany

Wall Street analysts expected an adjusted net loss of $52 cents a share but found themselves with a worse than expected loss of $1.06 per share.
Tesla delivered 14,402 new vehicles consisting of 9,764 Model S and 4,638 Model X in Q2, slightly ahead of last month’s estimates.
Tesla had originally aimed to deliver 80,000 vehicles by the end of the year. It is growing tougher by the day for the company to hit that goal. On the bright side, the company noted that almost half of Q2 production occurred in the final four weeks of the quarter. Moreover, Tesla had an additional 5,000 cars in transit at the quarter end on their way to be delivered.
Tesla is ambitiously expecting to deliver an additional 50,000 vehicles in the second half of the year. This target keeps them on track to hit the original 80,000 vehicle delivery estimate, despite only delivering approximately 30,000 vehicles in the first half of the year.
The company has invested heavily in its Gigafactory that opened last week and in preparations to launch the hotly anticipated Model 3 next year.
Investors have expressed some angst as Tesla has moved forward on plans to acquire SolarCity and pivot into a vertically integrated energy and transportation company. Hitting targets and staying strong on fundamentals would help ease some investor fears that the company is moving too quickly into a new space rather than fully finishing its mission to deliver affordable mass-market electric vehicles.
Missing targets marginally won’t impact the long term trajectory of the company, but in a world where media spin can be everything, Musk needs a major win on the rollout of the Model 3 to fully recapture investor confidence.
Tesla works with thousands of suppliers and Musk himself said on today’s earnings call that he didn’t expect to reach full volume of production by the self-imposed July 1st 2017 deadline for the Model 3. With thousands of disparate parts, Musk is all hands on deck, even meeting with suppliers personally, to ensure that the company comes as close as possible to that deadline.
Execution on the Model 3 is critical to enable future investment in the grander projects outlined in the company’s second master plan. Musk reiterated on the investor call that Tesla doesn’t have plans to increase capital expenditure until production of the Model 3 hits full volume.
Until then, the Tesla Model S 60 and 60D, have been drawing some customers off the Model 3 waitlist. The vehicles hit a price point between the upcoming Model 3 and older Model S. The Model 60 has seen solid demand but with only a 15-20 percent gross margin. Higher end sports models generate a 30-35 percent gross margin for the company. Musk wants to use vehicle upgrades to increase overall margins, essentially allowing drivers to unlock additional upgrades directly from vehicles.
Hitting the 80,000 vehicle delivery target will serve as a great proxy for those holding their breath on the future delivery of over 400,000 Model 3 pre-orders, and by extension the future value of Tesla stock.

996,ReachNow expands BMW car sharing to Portland,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/03/reachnow-expands-bmw-car-sharing-to-portland/,2016/08/03,"
After launching in Seattle in April, BMW’s car sharing service ReachNow is expanding down the I-5 corridor to Portland, Oregon. In Seattle, more than 13,000 people signed up in the first month, and ReachNow was able to add 150 vehicles and expand its service area by late June. It’s likely the Portland expansion will follow the same plan, with a fleet of vehicles in the city center and expansion to farther-flung neighborhoods as demand increases.
Portland is no stranger to car sharing. Daimler’s car2go has been operating its fleet of smart fortwos (some of which are plug-in electric vehicles) here since March 2012. And Zipcar has been offering a wide variety of vehicles in Portland, from hatchbacks to pickup trucks, under various names since 1998. ReachNow has more kinds of cars than car2go but fewer than Zipcar, and they’re all from the BMW family: BMW 3 series, BMW i3 PHEVs and several Mini Cooper models.
Currently, car2go has a membership of 45,000 in Portland and a fleet of 465 vehicles. In a phone interview, Portland’s car2go general manager Ken Hills said, “Portland is a great city for car share. There’s good density, and it’s a tech-savvy town with early adopters who are really receptive.” As for adding another service to the mix in a city of 630,000 residents, Hills said, “Having a competitor will also increase awareness and options. Flexibility is a good thing, and the more awareness, the better.”
Portland is the second official city ReachNow will serve, but the pilot project in the United States was in the San Francisco area. (The service is known as DriveNow in Europe). In a phone conversation earlier this summer, ReachNow CEO Steve Banfield noted that San Francisco does not support free-floating car sharing, like ReachNow and car2go, where users can pick up a nearby car and drop it off wherever they like, as long as it’s in the service area. San Francisco does support station-based car sharing, like Zipcar, where you pick up and drop off vehicles at fixed locations. This, plus the challenge of just parking in San Francisco, made Seattle — and now Portland — a better fit for ReachNow.
In a more recent phone interview after the Portland announcement, Banfield noted that Portland’s city government is supportive of car sharing, having already welcomed car2go and Zipcar. And with a population already aware of car sharing, Portland “ticks a lot of boxes in its own right,” he said.
Banfield pointed out that car sharing is only the tip of ReachNow’s service iceberg. “We said in April that we would expand service and features as well as expand across North America.” And we can expect to see some of those new services later this fall, according to Banfield. “We’re telegraphing every punch we’re taking,” he said. “We’re trying to move really, really fast.”
There’s no official word on when Portlanders will be able to actually use ReachNow, though it seemed from our conversation like it would happen within a matter of weeks, not months. In the meantime, Portlanders (and everyone else in the country) can sign up in advance of ReachNow reaching their city for free.

997,Comma.ai open-sources the data it used for its first successful driverless trips,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/03/comma-ai-open-sources-the-data-it-used-for-its-first-successful-driverless-trips/,2016/08/03,"
Comma.ai, the startup that George Hotz (aka Geohotz) founded to show that making driverless vehicles could done relatively cheaply using off-the-shelf components and existing vehicles, has open-sourced a dataset of 7.25 hours of highway driving.
It might not seem like a lot, but in terms of comparative datasets for highway driving out there, it is. And it’s what Hotz used to build the initial successful self-driving demo used to ferry Bloomberg around for comma.ai’s big public debut.
“When I started this project, I didn’t want to have to put things in cars – I just wanted to play with the machine learning,” explained Hotz in an interview. “But I looked around and there was no good source of data to do that.”
Hotz points to the KITTI dataset and the more extensive and recent Oxford RobotCar dataset as a couple of sources, but these involved urban driving tests. Hotz was after a highway driving data source.
“There is not a good highway dataset to replicate what we had in Bloomberg and what we had in Nvidia, and I think it’s time that the whole world should be able to do this,” Hotz explained.
This doesn’t mean just anyone can take comma.ai’s data and turn their 1998 Ford Tempo into a self-driving superstar – but it’s a starting point. Comma.ai did not open source what they’re using to drive their test car, and the dataset represents where the company was at in terms of total data as of around six months ago; the company has obviously gathered more in the intervening time.
“I believe in being as open as possible without killing the host organism; we make sure we keep the company alive to open source more stuff,” Hotz told me about comma.ai’s approach to making their sets available to the general public. “There were a lot of missteps along the way to get this sort of data – no one needs to repeat them.”
Hotz emphasized that what comma.ai wants to do by open-sourcing data sets like this one is to enable the hobbyist community to accomplish more without having to do fairly basic, but time-consuming and resource-intensive work of collecting basic driving data for use in training machine learning systems. He points to DeepDrive, a self-driving car system which uses neural nets to drive virtual cars in Grand Theft Auto V as a prime example of the kinds of people they’re looking to help.
Helping hobbyists means building a talent pipeline, too: comma.ai can watch what people are doing with the data they open source, and bring in-house the brightest lights among that community.
“The other reason that we release things like this open source is that we’re incredibly confident that we have figured out what we’re going to ship, and our path to winning the positive feedback loop that is self-driving cars is there. And let’s pull some people up behind us, too.”
Ultimately, Hotz says, the comma.ai philosophy is simple – tell people exactly what they’re doing, but remain confident in the startup’s ability to do it faster, smarter and cheaper.

998,Lear plans to ship a modular unit to let cars talk to smart cities and other vehicles,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/03/lear-plans-to-ship-a-modular-unit-to-let-cars-to-talk-to-smart-cities-and-other-vehicles/,2016/08/03,"
Car component supplier Lear is hoping to ride the wave of connectivity to new heights, with plans to develop and ship a unit for its car-maker customers that lets their vehicles communicate with other cars on the road, city infrastructure including connected roads and traffic lights, and with cloud-based services. The part would also be modular, letting OEMs easily install physical upgrades.
What Lear hopes to do is bring said component to market in only “a few years,” according to an interview that Lear’s VP of connectivity Praveen Singh gave to Crain’s Detroit Business (via Automotive News). For testing purposes, the project is making use of infrastructure tech used throughout Downton Detroit and Michigan, installed by Arada Systems, the connective mobility startup acquired by Lear last year which Singh founded.
Arada specialized in connecting cars with external networks, including other vehicles and traffic lights. Part of its focus is on ensuring that connections between cars and their environments remain secure, since two-way communication between vehicles and their surroundings present an attractive opportunity for potential bad actors. Lear will focus on security with its upcoming modular solution, too, both via swappable hardware and a plan to support regular security-focused, over-the-air updates.
Lear is far from the only company that wants to be the connective hub of tomorrow’s smart cars, but it has relationships in place that might help it get a first look from legacy companies more skeptical of new suppliers – provided it can deliver what it promises, which will be no small feat given that it also has to sell infrastructure customers on its system, as well.

999,Samsung could acquire its way into your car through Fiat,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/03/samsung-could-acquire-its-way-into-your-car-through-fiat/,2016/08/03,"
Samsung wants to make cars. Or at least, make parts of cars, in a similar supply-side capacity to the position it currently occupies in the mobile device and television world. A new Bloomberg report suggests Samsung is in talks with Fiat Chrysler to acquire some or all of parts-making subsidiary Magneti Marelli, which provides lighting, in-car entertainment and telematics to OEMs for use in their vehicles.
The deal, which could be worth north of $3 billion according to Bloomberg’s sources, would help accelerate Samsung’s existing efforts to become a more important part of the automotive supply chain. Samsung has a dominant position in the production of memory chips, TVs and smartphones, both as a first-party consumer brand and as a supplier, but its car business isn’t nearly as well-developed.
Samsung has an internal team working on in-car infotainment tech, vehicle components and autonomous driving systems, and it invested in China’s homegrown electric auto company BYD Co., as Bloomberg notes, but it’s far from synonymous with the auto industry as a key supplier in the way it is with smartphones and other computing devices. An acquisition at this level could be a big shortcut to broader presence in the industry.
While other tech giants, including Samsung’s chief rival Apple, have been pegged as making big bets on cars as an important center of the future high-tech industry, Samsung’s efforts on that front have been relatively low-key. It’s a safe bet that even beyond this sizeable acquisition, however, the smartphone leader is deeply considering its automotive options.

1000,Green Commuter gets you to work in Tesla Model X,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/02/green-commuter-gets-you-to-work-in-tesla-model-x/,2016/08/02,"
A vanpool is like a carpool, but a van can take more people to work in one trip. It is also significantly less cool-looking. But vanpoolers in Los Angeles need no longer worry about the potential for being uncool during the ride to work: Green Commuter has launched in the city with a fleet of all-electric, zero-emissions Tesla Model X SUVs.
Green Commuter is a cross between a vanpool and car sharing. Company CEO Gustavo Occhiuzzo said in a press release that there are 1,500 vanpools with destinations in Los Angeles County, with twice that many total across the region. Each of those vans is only used 10-15 hours a week, Occhiuzzo says. The rest of the time, they’re sitting in parking lots.
That’s where the shared-vehicle model Green Commuter uses comes in. Rather than paying for a van to sit for more than 90 percent of the work week, users can access an app via iOS and Android to share the Teslas and maximize their miles. A group of like-minded employees or a company can rent a Model X, which seats a van-like seven adults, by the month. A company could in theory replace its fleet of vanpool vehicles with shared Model Xs.
The vehicles are also available for sharing through Green Commuter on weekends for trips to places like Las Vegas or San Diego, basically somewhere in the Tesla’s range with a place to recharge at the destination. The website shows that Green Commuter already has service in Chattanooga, Tennessee, as well, with plans to expand statewide in California and further nationwide in the future.
Green Commuter was founded in 2014 and has been based at the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator since 2015. It’s launching an Indiegogo campaign today, August 2, to boost the user community with lower fees. Through the campaign, rentals start at $10 an hour or $150 a weekend, a discount from the usual rates of $18 per hour or $100-$250 per month.
Green Commuter joins Tesloop in using Tesla vehicles as shared and carpooling vehicles for chronically gridlocked Los Angelenos.

1001,Online used car dealer Vroom leverages virtual reality to bring the showroom to you,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/02/online-used-car-dealer-vroom-leverages-virtual-reality-to-bring-the-showroom-to-you/,2016/08/02,"
It would be a shame if we were able to build autonomous cars before we could simplify car buying.
Today, buying a used car means booking multiple weekends to test drive and examine every car at every dealership within a 50 mile radius. We fight through every other lemming on the nine to five grind who only had their weekend to hunt for their DeLorean every time we go out. Eventually we settle, we always do. Because no matter how cool our new ride is, we leave the dealership ready to drive the shiny vehicle through the sales office after painful negotiations and a trail of documents rivaling those of an IPO road show.
Online used car dealer Vroom wants to use virtual reality to put a smile on the face of car buyers while supporting their search for the perfect car.
The version launching today will cover 30 models of sports cars. By the end of the year, 300 models will be available for home inspection. While it’s true that over a million households now have access to VR headsets, Vroom will be opening popups at malls to let users who don’t have access to the expensive technology experience the virtual showroom.
From within the showroom, users can inspect vehicles and learn about models. Beyond cool features like hearing the exact corresponding engine sounds of each model, users can visualize important components including blind-spots review mirrors.
All vehicle models have been rendered from actual cars sold on Vroom. The company spends 48 hours going through cars to recondition them before sale.
Eventually Vroom plans to use 3D modeling to allow customers to visualize their cars in different colors with different packages. Individual automakers have used VR for some time, but Vroom believes their strongest asset is the ability to compare cars in one place. The company is developing a virtual garage to assist customers in the purchasing process.
We tried their new system on an HTC Vive and it’s nifty. The version rolling out today is a decent preview of what’s to come, but the coolest version by far is yet to be released. Future versions will not only include additional cars, but additional interactivity. The version I tested let me bend down and walk around vehicles. I could examine cars close up and far away, open doors, and inspect specific components inside and outside of the vehicles. The higher resolution models were complemented with appropriate lighting and paint shine. The best way to describe it would be like going from Gran Turismo 4 to Gran Turismo 5.
Of course virtual reality is more of a pleasant distraction than a true solution to the stresses of car buying. While customers will be able to check out inventory within the virtual showroom, they will only be able to buy cars on Vroom’s website. To address the loan market, Vroom will need to digitize and standardize documents and offer a solution for docusignatures. The company is quick to point out that it’s their next priority to service this market of car-buyers. The base VR experience will also be coming to Google Cardboard in Q4.

1002,"Didi wins, Uber retreats, but Chinese riders and drivers lose",https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/monopodidi/,2016/08/01,"
No one wants to fight a land war in Asia, not even Uber. It could have burnt mountains of cash battling for market share with local ride app juggernaut Didi Chuxing, between marketing, discounts, and driver incentives.
Instead, Uber surrendered.
It’s sold its UberChina operation to Didi in exchange for a 20% stage in the merged company, while Didi has invested $1 billion into Uber at a stunning $68 billion valuation
Essentially, Uber didn’t think it could own enough of the Chinese market minus the enormous amount it would have spent competing with its new ally to do better than walking away with 20% of Didi.
Eliminating this hole Uber had been throwing money down, the coast is clear for it to IPO. If the deal lets Uber concentrate on winning the rest of the globe, it’s not really a loss to concede China. Just a battle it had to sacrifice as part of Word War Ride.
But there is a loser in the UberChina – Didi Chuxing merger: the Chinese ride app user.
Without these two super-powers trying to undercut each on ride prices and one-up each other on partner compensation, both drivers and riders are left at the mercy of what looks much more like an on-demand transportation monopoly.
Compared to when there was hardcore competition, Didi won’t have to race to improve functionality, from its app interface to its routing algorithms. It won’t have to offer as enticing bonuses to the men and women behind the wheel. And it won’t have to make concessions to get more cars on the road so it always has the shortest wait time.
China, historically lax on local monopolies, isn’t likely to break up a local business winner over anti-trust concerns.
It all makes me thankful that the US has Lyft nipping at Uber’s heels, keeping it on its toes.
Whether it’s Google Search butting out Yelp local results or Facebook’s approach to privacy, we’ve seen how domination of a technology space by one company leaves the masses with less power.

1003,In-car cameras let autonomous vehicles track passengers as well as pedestrians,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/in-car-cameras-let-autonomous-vehicles-track-passengers-as-well-as-pedestrians/,2016/08/01,"
Powerful sensors and software have made autonomous cars impressively aware of their surroundings — but it isn’t just obstacles, pedestrians, and other cars that a vehicle’s AI needs to watch out for. It also needs to know what’s going on inside itself, and researchers from Fraunhofer are hard at work making that happen.
“We are expanding sensor technology to the entire interior,” said Fraunhofer’s Michael Voit, who manages the research group, in a company blog post. “Using depth-perception cameras, we capture the vehicle’s interior, identify the number of people, their size and their posture. From this we can deduce their activities.”
Lots going on in this car that the AI would probably want to be aware of.
There are plenty of benefits in a car knowing how many passengers it has, where they are, and what they’re doing. In case of emergency — a sensor failure, for instance — the car will know how long it will take for a driver to reach the wheel. If a kid in the back seat slips out of their seatbelt while mom and dad are taking a nap (the privilege of owning a self-driving car), they can be warned. In a collision scenario, the car could steer so that it is struck in an unoccupied quarter. Airbag deployment, too, could be adjusted to the size or position of a passenger.

Of course, some of these things can be accomplished with existing tech — weight sensors and the like — but more and finer awareness of the passengers is still a worthwhile goal in autonomous vehicles. Work is progressing on identifying various actions and common objects as well — understanding that a person is reaching for the sun visor, or installing a child seat, for example.
So far the cameras have only been installed in the R&D company’s driving simulator, but the plan is to put it into a smartened-up minivan for real-world testing.
Fraunhofer is working with Volkswagen Group Research, Bosch, Visteon, and others on this “Intelligent Car Interior” project, and the whole thing is funded by grants from the German government.

1004,Tesla moves forward on $2.6B SolarCity acquisition,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/tesla-moves-forward-on-2-6b-solarcity-acquisition/,2016/08/01,"
Early this morning, Tesla announced that it had come to an agreement to acquire SolarCity in a $2.6 billion all stock transaction. Tesla first announced it was interested in acquiring the solar power company back in June.
In the wake of the announcement, both Tesla and SolarCity stock is being traded down. The original anticipated range for the sale was $26.50 to $28.50 per share. Rather, the deal will be moving forward at $25.37 per share. This is a loss of over $200 million dollars in SolarCity value over the last month based on shares of the company outstanding.

Solarcity Corporation (SCTY) Stock Price | FindTheCompany

When the announcement was first made back in June, Tesla stock tumbled while SolarCity was bid up. Unfortunately for SolarCity, investors didn’t get the same treatment this time. SolarCity lowered its guidance in sync with the announcement this morning, blaming lower than expected demand for its solar technology.
Both Tesla and SolarCity filed Form 8-K’s notifying investors the companies had reached an agreement. SolarCity shareholders will receive 0.110 common shares per SolarCity share rather than the originally proposed 0.122 to 0.131. Members of both boards, including Musk, have recused themselves from voting on the transaction because of conflicts of interest.
Tesla expects the transaction to produce $150 million in cost synergies in the year after the deal closes. The company wants to kick-back some of these synergies to consumers and make clean energy more accessible. Many of the synergies are textbook: combined customers and streamlined marketing. However, because Tesla has a retail network of its own, it will be able to sell direct-to-consumer right from its stores at the time a car is purchased.
Tesla is now on the second part of its two-part master plan. The Tesla SolarCity acquisition represents the completion of the final goal in Musk’s first master plan. The decade old plan called on Tesla to “provide zero emission electric power generation options.” The new plan announced last month calls on Tesla to “Create stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage.”
To create a truly vertically integrated energy company, Musk needs to own both power generation and the storage of energy produced. In time for its acquisition of SolarCity, Tesla opened its $5 billion Gigafactory earlier this week. At full efficiency, the factory will reduce lithium ion battery costs by 30 percent by 2020. To charge all these batteries, Tesla needs to get inside the solar market lickety–split if it wants full control of the space.
To realize the full value that this acquisition could bring to Tesla shareholders, it is important to view the transaction in the context of Tesla’s future plans. Musk wants to push Tesla farther into the commercial space with electric solutions for public mass transit and cargo transport. Battery technology will not be limited to Powerwall and Powerpack in the future.
To put Tesla’s hunger for batteries in perspective, the average car today can attain 25 miles-per-gallon while a semi in gasoline equivalent comes out around 5 miles-per-gallon. This presents both an engineering and economic challenge. Not only would Tesla need to supply enough batteries to close the gap, it would need to simultaneously reduce vehicle charging downtime while increasing battery output. Every minute spent charging extends delivery times. Every battery in a trailer results in fewer goods being transported.
Tesla has its work cut out for it over the next decade. Investors are angsty about the acquisition because it means more uncertainty. Musk’s mission depends on success in not one but many areas of research and development. Autonomous driving technology could remove the driver all together opening up cab space for batteries. Reductions in the cost of batteries could open up Tesla’s technology to emerging markets.
If Musk can catch the clean energy conversion at just the right time, Tesla will make a fortune that will bankroll other projects. Unfortunately, Breakout Labs isn’t funding Tesla right now and technical execution risk will reduce the value of Tesla in the short term on public markets.
The transaction is expected to close in Q4 2016 after shareholders vote at their respective meetings.

1005,Uber reportedly invested $500 million to build a better mapping system,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/uber-reportedly-invested-500-million-to-build-a-better-mapping-system/,2016/08/01,"
According to a report in the Financial Times over the weekend, the ridesharing giant is adding half a billion dollars to a new mapping project to help free itself of Google Maps.
Many ridesharing services use the maps service to navigate the roads, but Google Maps has limited accuracy in many non-Western countries. Google has also upped the cost of the service lately, cutting into Uber’s margins.
Uber declined to comment on that sum but did issue an update on its blog from new hire Brian McClendon, an ex-Google Maps engineer responsible for creating Google Earth who will be responsible for building Uber’s new mapping system.
“The ongoing need for maps tailored to the Uber experience is why we’re doubling down on our investment in mapping,” McClendon wrote, later adding, “The street imagery captured by our mapping cars will help us improve core elements of the Uber experience, like ideal pick-up and drop-off points and the best routes for riders and drivers.”
Uber has also acquired a few mapping technologies and hired a whole bunch of Microsoft engineers to support its map work, along with forging a few partnerships with navigation system companies like TomTom and Digital Globe.
The devil, as they say, is in the details and the reliance on Google has been a pain point for riders in foreign lands. Drivers often have to call riders to ask for their exact location, only frustrating the situation by adding an unnecessary step in the process. The new project will be a boon to anyone using Uber outside the United States.
And Uber, with close to $12 billion in funding and a seemingly endless supply of investors ready to hand over more cash, can definitely afford to build and maintain its own mapping system now — one that can be tailored for ridesharing — something very handy once Uber rolls out its fleet of self-driving cars.

1006,Verizon buys Fleetmatics for $2.4B in cash to step up in telematics,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/verizon-buys-fleetmatics-for-2-4b-in-cash-to-step-up-in-telematics/,2016/08/01,"
Hot off the heels of its acquisition of Yahoo last week for $4.8 billion, today Verizon announced another huge purchase: it’s buying Fleetmatics, a telematics company based out of Dublin, Ireland, for $2.4 billion in cash, to build out the products that it offers to enterprises in the areas of logistics and workforces that are on the move.
The deal will make Fleetmatics a part of Verizon Telematics, a subsidiary of the telco that focuses on fleet management, mobile workforce solutions and IoT. It’s part of a short spate of acquisitions that Verizon has been making lately to expand those operations: about six weeks ago, Verizon Telematics announced that it would acquire Telogis (financial terms undisclosed).
More generally, the acquisition of Fleetmatics points to ways that Verizon is continuing to use its balance sheet to finance investments into newer areas to offset continuing declines in its core, legacy business of basic phone services. As that market has become increasingly commoditized and people turn to other, digitised forms of communication away from traditional voice services, Verizon is hoping to invest into newer areas to move beyond “dumb pipe” status to keep its margins up, and revenues growing.
While its acquisition of AOL (and now Yahoo) will help Verizon scale up its media, advertising and content operations, Fleetmatics is pointing straight to Verizon’s ambitions in enterprise services, and specifically enterprise mobility.
The wider context of that market is interesting.
On one hand, there are traditional customers for these services: companies that employ fleets of workers who are constantly on the move as part of the companies’ wider operations (Fleetmatics’ existing customers include businesses like Time Warner Cable and DirecTV).
The boom in smartphone services and enterprise mobility has given this customer base a wider range of tools to do these jobs better, and Verizon wants to be their go-to for purchasing them.
On the other, there is a growing new market, too: companies like Uber have been investing a lot to build out a logistics business that goes beyond the transportation of people, and there are a number of other startups (and much larger players, like Amazon) that are hoping to disrupt more traditional providers of services to move things from points A to B. Verizon is buying into the technology used for these services as well, as another way to increase the revenues it makes from enterprises, beyond basic network connectivity.
Fleetmatics is an SaaS-based provider of GPS and other services to fleets and companies with mobile workforces. It has 37,000 customers, 737,000 subscribers and 1,200 employees. The services that it offers include location services, driver and car security services, fuel tracking, dispatching and billing/invoice services.
The company has been publicly traded since 2012 and the deal is equivalent to $60 per share in cash, Verizon said. When it was private, Fleetmatics had raised over $93 million from investors like IVP.
Verizon Telematics CEO Andres Irlando says the deal was done to build up its telematics services for small and medium businesses.
“Fleetmatics is a market leader in North America — and increasingly internationally — and they’ve developed a wide-range of compelling SaaS-based products and solutions for small- and medium-sized businesses,” he said in a statement. We will be talking with him later and will ask if there are more deals of this kind to come.


“Verizon and Fleetmatics share a vision that the SaaS-based fleet management solution market is extraordinarily large, lightly penetrated, global and fragmented which can best be attacked together with a world class product offering and the largest distribution channel in the industry,” said Jim Travers, Chairman and CEO of Fleetmatics, in a statement.
Verizon Telematics is a subsidiary of the company that also owns AOL (which owns TechCrunch). It is active in more than 40 markets globally with a mix of software and hardware solutions.
The deal is expected to close in the Q4 2016.

You probably aren’t trying to set a land speed record for an all-electric, street legal car, but if you are, I have bad news: The goalposts just got moved further out. Genovation‘s Extreme Electric (GXE) car, which uses a Corvette Z06 chassis with a custom electric drive under the hood, broke its previous record of 186.8 mph by a margin of nearly 20 mph. The new record now stands at 205.6 mph.
That’s fast. How fast? Well, not quite as fast as the fastest gas-guzzling legal production vehicle, which is the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super Sport which maxed out at 258 mph. But the GX’s record-breaking run at Kennedy Space Center’s Shuttle Landing Facility is an important milestone for something that employs entirely electric power.
The GXE isn’t exactly a mass-market vehicle, of course. Even though it can technically drive on the streets, you’ll need at least $300,000 to pick one up. But the performance overall might surprise you – I was expecting little to no range, but the vehicle’s 44-kWh battery will provide around 120 miles of range, provided you’re driving normally and aren’t, say, trying to break a land-speed record.

1009,Hanergy to build solar-powered electric cars,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/28/hanergy-to-build-solar-powered-electric-cars/,2016/07/28,"
It used to be that only car companies could build cars. But this is the twenty-first century, when seemingly anyone can build a car or four, including a Chinese solar power company. Hanergy Holding Group, which manufactures thin-film solar panels, has created a Solar Vehicle Business Division that debuted four solar-powered prototypes in Beijing.
In a world where anyone can come up with an idea for a vehicle, few make it all the way to production. Hanergy announced its plans to build solar-powered vehicles last year, but it failed to produce prototypes on schedule, leading industry analysts to doubt its capabilities.
But this summer, Hanergy showcased four running and driving prototypes called the Hanergy Solar O, L, A and R (check that acronym!), each designed for a different use case. All the vehicles are lightweight and covered as much as practical in flexible thin-film solar cells. According to a press release, the cells will generate 8 to 10 kWh of energy with 5 to 6 hours of sunlight, which translates to a range of 80 km (50 miles). That range is in the ballpark with several EVs available from major manufacturers, like the Fiat 500e and VW e-Golf.
That’s going to take some serious sunlight conversion, and Hanergy’s current cells have a conversion rate of 31.6 percent, the highest rate of any cells available today. Hanergy expects the rate of its cells to go up to 42 percent in the next decade, which would be enough to power a car entirely with sunlight. In the meantime, you can plug a Hanergy car in and charge the lithium-ion batteries like any other EV for an expected total range, solar and plug combined, of more than 200 miles.
Hanergy isn’t the only company working to integrate electric vehicles with zero-emissions solar charging. You may have heard of Tesla and SolarCity. If you’ve been following automotive news for a while, you may remember the Fisker Karma, which at the 2009 Detroit auto show had a prototype vehicle with solar cells on the roof (that company went bankrupt in 2013 and is being rebooted as Karma Automotive). And in 2014, the Toyota Prius was available with solar panels on the moon roof that powered a remote air conditioning system to cool the car before you got into it.

1010,UberCENTRAL lets businesses request and pay for customer rides,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/28/ubercentral-lets-businesses-request-and-pay-for-customer-rides/,2016/07/28,"
You can lead a horse to water and hope they’ll buy something when they’re there – or at least, that’s how I think the expression goes after learning that Uber is launching a new program called UberCENTRAL to let businesses of any size request, pay for and manage rides for customers from a centralized dashboard.
UberCENTRAL is a project that manages to target both low- and high-income markets at once. As Uber notes in a blog post, it could just as easily work for a business whose core customers are unlikely to have smartphones, like senior citizens in Atlanta, as it could while providing a door-to-door white glove valet experience for upscale Bloomingdale’s shoppers.
It’s also ideal for more traditional uses, like arranging airport service for hotel guests or providing rides for clients of doctor or dental clinics undergoing outpatient procedures. And as I alluded to at the outset, businesses with particularly high-margin goods and services could use this to bring people in the door, rather than just for sending them on their way post-purchase.
Long-term, UberCENTRAL plants a seed that could grow into something much bigger. A centralized dispatch app that’s accessible to business customers is likely to be a key ingredient in the successful deployment of a network of on-demand driverless vehicles, something that Uber is publicly working towards. With the help of technologies like changeable interactive in-vehicle displays, you could also foresee a time when businesses could effectively brand an on-demand fleet, adding to the overall customer effect.
UberCENTRAL is available to businesses in the U.S. and Canada starting today, with expansion elsewhere likely to follow later (Uber invites businesses in other markets to sign up for expansion updates). It seems like a smart way for businesses to quickly add value to their customers’ overall experience, which could be an important distinction in a retail environment when the temptation to stay home and shop online is strong.

1011,Consumer advocacy groups ask the FTC to look into Mercedes-Benz Drive Pilot ad,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/28/consumer-advocacy-groups-ask-the-ftc-to-look-into-mercedes-benz-drive-pilot-ad/,2016/07/28,"
A letter to the FTC co-authored by executives from Consumer Reports, the Ralph Nader-founded Center for Auto Safety and the Center for Auto Safety, as well as a former NHTSA Administrator, asks that the federal regulator investigate Mercedes-Benz on the grounds a new TV ad overstates the self-driving capabilities of the 2017 E-Class.

The consumer watchdog organizations are concerned specifically that the ad, embedded above, could lead viewers to believe that the E-Class is effectively an autonomous vehicle, both because it shows a family in another, entirely conceptual car interacting while that sci-fi inspired vehicle drives itself, and also because the driver of the actual E-Class shown in the ad removes his hands from the steering wheel of the car as it navigates itself left, and continues to keep them off while the car parks itself.
The open letter also takes issue with the copy used for the voiceover narration, which does not actually call the E-Class self-driving or fully autonomous, but which does refer to the vehicle as “autonomous-thinking,” with “self-braking, self-correcting, self-parking.” Further, the group cites a print ad which explicitly referred to the E-Class as “a self-driving car,” something which Mercedes has defended as common industry vernacular, and which they attempted to mitigate later in the campaign with additional fine print disclaimers.
The letter doesn’t necessarily mean an official FTC inquiry will follow, but the logic in the letter is sound. Car makers have always taken creative liberties when crafting their TV and print ads, often creating hyper- or surreal slightly altered versions of reality in order to activate the aspirational desires of potential purchasers. But as we move into a world of increasingly automated driving, clarity around what is, and what isn’t, true self-driving might mean some of that traditional creative license gets reined in.
Update: In a statement to Reuters, a Daimler spokesperson denied that the ad was misleading and provided the following statement:
“It was and is not our intent to cause any confusion between current driver assistance systems and the vision of an autonomous future.”
Update 2: Mercedes has now taken the ad out of their rotation and marked the video as private on YouTube as a direct result of the claim made by the consumer group, according to Automotive News.

Drivers from both services and others like Yidao Yongche, majority owned by big-spending LeEco, have operated in fuzzy areas, with police arresting drivers and impounding cars on a seemingly inconsistent basis in China. (As a non-Mandarin speaker, having police stop your Uber or Didi is a truly worrying experience that I’ve lived through.) These rules are still to be adopted by regional and local officials across China, but this is most definitively a step in the right direction for ride-hailing operators.
Sources told Bloomberg that the main features of the rules, which are slated to go into effect from November 1 this year, include:

Online car booking services will be made legal
The government will encourage development of a sharing economy and online car booking and non-cash payments
Drivers must have a minimum of three years of driving experience to work on a ride-hailing platform
Cars cannot have more than seven seats and must be retired from service after reaching 600,000 km
User information and data collected by car-booking platforms must be stored within China and for at least two years

Some of those stipulations may count against part-time drivers, and it remains unclear how that will impact Uber and Didi’s fleet of cars. In general, though, the duo have both been very vocal in welcoming the regulations — most likely because they are not as extreme as an earlier version of the proposal had been.
Uber called the announcement of the regulations “a welcome step in a country that has consistently shown itself to be forward-thinking when it comes to innovation.”
“Modern regulations can let these services grow while ensuring public safety and protecting consumers,” the company added in a blog post.
Didi Chuxing, the company that is widely acknowledged to be leading Uber in China and recently raised a round in excess of $7 billion, called today’s development “a positive first step.”
“We believe the Rules reflect the government’s open-minded regulatory approach to the mobile car-hailing industry in the broader context of the sharing economy,” it said in a statement.
“As a member of the rideshare community, DiDi welcomes the government’s endorsement and encouragement of the industry and China’s emerging sharing economy. We believe the Rules will usher in a new stage of growth for China’s online ride-booking ecosystem and that DiDi is prepared to meet these new requirements,” the company added.
It isn’t all rosy right off the bat, however. As mentioned, these rules will need to be adopted at both provincial and municipal level across China, and, in order to comply with them, the ride-hailing companies will need to apply and secure new licenses for their businesses.
Didi — which said it will set aside around $15 million for a “development fund” to speed up its integration with regulators, taxi firms and drivers — did voice some concern at the licensing issue process proposed.
We noticed that the Rules require, in general principle, local taxi administration authorities to manage the platform licensing application process, and a certain discretion is granted local governments to determine the detailed operating requirements. We call for local authorities to adopt market-driven approaches that encourage innovation and new business models in order to continue serving the real needs and interests of our ecosystem participants. One of the greatest merits of ridesharing is to mobilize and efficiently allocate fragmented and under-utilized resources to meet fluctuating transportation demands. We also hope local practices will allow for separate treatment of part-time drivers to foster supply-side reform in the transportation industry.
Didi claims 14 million drivers and over 300 million active users with 10 million rides per day. Uber China doesn’t issue figures, but Chinese cities account for a number of Uber’s busiest cities on the planet. While those figures are impressive and indicative of how large a market China is, these companies are still scratching the service.
Li Zijian, senior director for international strategy at Didi, recently estimated that his company has reached just 1.1 percent of consumers in the country. Li pegged the on-demand transportation industry in China to be worth $200 billion over the next five years, and legitimizing the industry is surely an important component — for both Didi and Uber.

1013,AR in Mercedes-Benz’s Rescue Assist app gives first responders an inside look,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/27/ar-in-mercedes-benzs-rescue-assist-app-gives-first-responders-an-inside-look/,2016/07/27,"
Mercedez-Benz has been putting QR codes on the B-pillars and inside the fuel door of new cars since November 2013, and those have provided a way for first responders and emergency personnel to quickly get detailed model info about any Mercedes-Benz vehicle involved in an accident using the Rescue Assist mobile app. Now, an update brings 3D imagery, as well as augmented reality, to the existing app, letting people involved in rescue operation get an even better overall picture of the situation when an accident happens.
Through the new AR features, emergency personnel can see color-coded representations of internal components, including key areas to be wary of when doing things like cutting through vehicles to free trapped passengers. The app will provide insight into where things like fuel lines, batteries and other electrical components are located, in order to help reduce the risk of further damage or injury that arises when a car needs to be unconventionally dismantled in order to save lives.
The Rescue Assist app will also still provide resources including rescue cards, which provide an overview of relevant safety info specific to each particular model (which includes not only Mercedes-Benz consumer cars and vans, but also some Fuso-branded commercial vehicles.
This is the kind of AR use case that led a lot of people to think Google Glass had potential as a tool in specific industry verticals, emergency response among the most often cited. Baking it into an existing app for use with the smartphones that rescue personnel are likely to have on them anyway is probably a much better application of the tech, even if it isn’t hands-free.

1014,Ford and MIT project provides on-demand electric shuttles for students,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/27/ford-and-mit-project-provides-on-demand-electric-shuttles-for-students/,2016/07/27,"
Ford is working with MIT on a research project that will deploy a new fleet of on-demand electric shuttles that can ferry students from class-to-class both on campus and on city roads at MIT’s Cambridge, Mass. location. Students can hail one of three electric shuttles using an app on their smartphone, and a driver will arrive quickly to pick them up. The research projects hopes to shed light on pedestrian traffic patterns, using LiDAR and other sensors combined with data including weather info and class schedules to optimize the on-demand service.
In addition to helping Ford improve its Dynamic Shuttle project, which currently operates fearing shuttles to employees at the car company’s Dearborn, Michigan campus, the collaboration with MIT will help with Ford’s general aim of exploring different kinds of future transportation under the Ford Smart Mobility umbrella. Specifically, though Ford is also looking to this phase of the project to examine how it can improve detection of pedestrians using lower resolution LiDAR systems than are currently employed in most LiDAR-equipped cars on the road.
“The autonomous vehicles that we use today use LiDAR, and it’s likely that autonomous vehicles in the future will use LiDAR,” explained Bryan Goodman, Ford’s Manger and Technical Leader of Autonomous Vehicle Analysis and the project lead on this MIT engagement in an interview. “This program is gathering good information, and experimenting with various ways to use less resolution in LiDAR to detect pedestrians than some of the LiDAR units we use today.”
Graduate student Justin Miller and undergrad Wally Wibowo of the Aerospace Controls Lab working on vehicles outfitted with sensors that match those of self-driving cars. This work is part of the Ford-MIT Alliance and aims to predict pedestrian behaviors on short time-scales while also providing data to support a mobility-on-demand system for the MIT campus. William Litant/MIT
Getting better results from lower-resolution LiDAR systems has a number of potential advantages, including making hybrid self-driving tech less dependant on supplemental info provided by cameras, and potentially reducing the cost of production of self-driving vehicles, which would make producing them at-scale more viable for car makers and using them more affordable for car owners or passengers in a shared system. This research project provides a safe way to test lower resolution hardware since a driver remains in control and the environment is more controlled than a city roadway, while still providing the benefits of a real-wold testing ground.
The project is also looking to make the most of the resources available in terms of providing good car-sharing service to students actually using the shuttles. To that end, data about trips is gathered and then shared back to the research team for analysis, which is then used to optimize pick-ups, trip routes and drop-offs.
Goodman says that data is being analyzed to accurately predict demand, which processed by algorithms that try to identify the best places for the shuttles to be positioned to maximize customer service. These locations are then fed back to drivers to inform their driving routine, and the process continues cyclically to try to achieve the best possible results regardless of time of day, weather conditions or other variables.
Goodman said that the current phase of the project is scheduled to run through the end of this year, but MIT and Ford are already working on what the next phase or phases might look like. One of the next steps, he says, will be to replace the driver-operated electric shuttles (which Ford terms “mobility-on-demand” or MOD vehicles) with fully autonomous versions, and the data and learning acquired during this phase will be key to achieving that goal.

1015,Mercedes-Benz shows off the first fully electric heavy urban transport truck,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/27/mercedes-benz-shows-off-the-first-fully-electric-heavy-urban-transport-truck/,2016/07/27,"
Daimler isn’t about to let Tesla own any more ‘firsts’ in electric transportation; the German company revealed the Mercedes-Benz Urban eTruck today in Stuttgart, an all-electric truck with a total admissible weight capacity of 26 tonnes (29 U.S. tons), which makes it the first clean energy big rig of its kind.
As the name implies, it’s designed for use in urban environments, capping off the short-sprint end of the heavy transport shipping cycle. That’s in part due to its max range of 200 kilometres (about 124 miles). The prototype Urban eTruck is ready for its close-up, but Daimler notes that we’ll have to wait until a “conceivable” launch window of “the beginning of the next decade” for wide-scale production and real-world use.
Still, Daimler beat Tesla to the punch with this reveal, since Tesla CEO Elon Musk only last week that the company is working on an electric Tesla Semi transport truck, with a reveal planned for as early as next year. And Daimler’s not just sitting around waiting for the future launch of its big rig; the same Fuso Canter E-Cell tech it hopes to employ in the Urban eTruck are already in use in a light distribution truck with a 6-tonne (around 7 tons) max capacity, which is currently in testing with customers, including European courier company Hermes.

 
In addition to emissions and environmental benefits, use of vehicles like the Urban eTruck have an immediate upside for city-dwellers: reduced noise. Anyone who’s ever been near a large truck when it trundled down a city street, gearing up from a stop at a traffic light, knows the absolute pain of hearing that huge chugging internal combustion engine wrestling with getting up to a pacing speed.
Scaled production of the Urban eTruck seems not to rest on too many tech hurdles any more – Daimler praises the progress of the drive component that powers the vehicle – but what is limiting larger runs is likely the cost-to-efficiency ratio. Daimler says in a press release that it anticipates prices for its batteries to have dropped by a factor of 2.5 between 1997 and 2025, while battery performance will have increased in the same proportion.

1016,"What the NTSB knows about the fatal Tesla crash, so far",https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/26/what-the-national-transportation-safety-board-knows-about-the-fatal-tesla-crash-so-far/,2016/07/26,"
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) issued a preliminary report on the fatal crash involving a 2015 Tesla Model S and a 2014 Freightliner Cascadia truck in Williston, Florida in May.
Unfortunately, the report yields no major new insights.
The report confirms that the driver of the Tesla was going 74 miles per hour just prior to the crash, and on a highway where the speed limit was 65 miles per hour. It also confirms that he was using Tesla’s “advanced driver assistance features,” a.k.a. Autopilot, including “Traffic-Aware Cruise Control” and “Autosteer lane keeping assistance.”
The NTSB made no promises about when a final report will be issued, but noted that it typically takes a full year to complete data analysis and answer questions about the probable cause of a crash in such investigations.
A professor at George Washington University Law School, Wayne Cohen, who is also a founding partner of personal injury law firm Cohen & Cohen, said fatality reports are usually investigated by state police, not federal authorities.
The Tesla crash in Williston, Florida has garnered federal intervention, he said, because, “We are in an environment with vehicles on the road using increasingly complex technology, artificial intelligence that goes beyond the cruise control and event data recorders we’ve had for decades. The waters are muddied and unchartered with this technology when it comes to civil and criminal liability.”
Results of investigations will help answer questions for the families of those harmed or killed in accidents, perhaps most importantly. But they will also help the U.S. establish a framework for law and legislation to bring those vehicles into everyday use domestically, Cohen suggested.
Tesla did not yet respond to inquiries about how it is working with the NTSB, NHTSA and Florida state police to complete their various investigations into the fatal crash.
Since the crash occurred, the company has been called upon by Consumer Reports to “disable” and rename its Autopilot feature until it is made safer.
Tesla responded with a resounding “no,” to Consumer Reports, and really all its critics, with this statement:
“Tesla is constantly introducing enhancements, proven over millions of miles of internal testing, to ensure that drivers supported by Autopilot remain safer than those operating without assistance. We will continue to develop, validate, and release those enhancements as the technology grows.”
Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk has also repeatedly pointed out that Tesla Motors vehicles have driven 130 million miles on Autopilot with one confirmed fatality, which is a safety record better than that of human drivers.
Last week, Musk published a “Master Plan” for Tesla’s future, including the goal of making Autopilot 10 times safer than traditional driving. In the plan, Musk said at the current rate, the company would see 6 billion miles driven by Tesla vehicles with Autopilot engaged in about 5.5 years. That’s the point at which he expects the technology will be ready for “global,” mainstream approval.
And of course, it’s not just Tesla’s technology that is under scrutiny. The company works with other vendors.
For example, it has used Mobileye image analysis processors to enable semi-autonomous driving. Today, Mobileye announced that partnership was coming to an end.

On their quarterly earnings call this morning, self-driving automotive technology company MobileEye announced that Mobileye’s work with Tesla will not extend beyond EyeQ3, the processor currently used in Tesla vehicles to provide the image analysis intelligence that enables Tesla’s driver-assisted autonomous tech
Mobileye CTO Amnon Shashua explained on the call that the company will continue to work with Tesla on improving the performance of EyeQ3 in use in Tesla cars, and suggested that concern around reputation regarding the safety of Mobileye’s tech, which is a clear reference to the fatal Autopilot crash earlier this year, though he didn’t cite the accident directly. He also didn’t expressly state whether Mobileye or Tesla ended the relationship.
Shashua also said that the company believes achieving true autonomy means going “beyond typical supplier relationships,” wherein a client just purchases support and service, and requires a true partnership between car makers and autonomous technology companies like Mobileye.
“EyeQ3 shipments will continue for the near future, and maybe for the longer future,” Shashua explained on the call regarding the discussion. “We simply decided where we wanted to put our resources for the future of autonomous driving… and we decided what we decided.”
An analyst questioned Shashua on the call regarding who initiated the separation, but the CTO declined to offer any additional clarity beyond the original statements, simply reiterating that Mobileye decided not to proceed. Mobileye also said on the call that Tesla’s business is “not material” to its bottom line in terms of a percentage of overall revenue.
The hesitation on clarifying how exactly the relationship ended is interesting given reports that Musk and self-driving solo engineer George Hotz (aka Geohot) exchanged emails about Hotz coming in-house to help Tesla develop its own self-driving supply stack. We’ve reached out to Tesla for additional info on how the Mobileye partnership wound down and will update if they provide more detail.

1019,Gett CEO claims his ride-share company is beating Uber in Europe,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/25/gett-ceo-claims-his-ride-share-company-is-beating-uber-in-europe/,2016/07/25," 



It is a very competitive landscape for on-demand rides. While Uber dominates the market in the U.S., Didi Chuxing is the leader in China.
And in Europe, there is another player that is making headway. Gett, formerly known as GetTaxi, is the “number one on-demand mobility company operating in Europe,” according to CEO Shahar Waiser. TechCrunch sat down with him for a video interview in Tel Aviv, where the company got started.
Now a unicorn with a valuation exceeding $1 billion, Gett gained early traction with corporate customers who used the service for black cars. Today, Gett is especially popular in places like London where people use it for hailing cabs.
Gett is now the European leader in terms of “volume of rides, revenues, profits,” said Waiser.  And “corporate is still responsible for a third of our income,” he maintained, saying that over 4,000 companies use Gett for transportation.

But while the service does well in Tel Aviv, London, and Moscow, the company’s expansion to the U.S. had a rough start. Gett faced some early challenges signing up enough drivers to meet demand in New York.
Gett does not offer surge pricing, which the company feels is a selling point for customers wanting to avoid facing unexpectedly high fares. But it also has been key to Uber’s ability to balance supply and demand. 
While Uber and traditional yellow cabs still dominate the Manhattan market, “New York happens to be our fastest growing territory,” Waiser claims. Currently in over 60 cities, he says they will also be ”expanding across the rest of the countries of Europe” soon enough.
And they are getting some big help from an incumbent in the automotive space.  Volkswagen recently invested in $300 million in Gett, in a move that drew comparisons to General Motors’ investment in Lyft.
Speaking about the deal, Waiser said the “exclusive partnerships with VW Group will help us get first access to autonomous cars.” He spoke of the inevitability of self-driving vehicles and predicted that they will account for half of new car purchases by 2030.
While drivers are understandably concerned that their jobs will be eliminated, Waiser was frank about what’s to come. “It’s the elephant in the room,” he said.

Audi is joining others like Daimler in focusing future investment on emerging tech categories like electric vehicles and self-origin cars, according to CEO Rupert Stadler. Speaking to German newspaper Stuttgarter Zeitung (via Reuters) this past weekend, Stadler said that in addition to targeting up to 30 percent electric vehicle sales for Audi overall by 2025, the company is going to create a subsidiary devoted to developing autonomous driving tech called SDS Company.
Audi’s electric car plans include the introduction of three models to be introduced by 2020, Stadler says, with a significant shift in resources re-allocated to improving the company’s electric pipeline. part of the electric lineup will be A-series smaller vehicles, but gas-powered compacts like the two-door A3 might get the axe to free up spending for future-focused projects instead.
As for its driverless ambitions, Stadler tells the paper that “this is about a robot car that may not even need a steering wheel or pedals, so it’s ideal for urban traffic,” but adds that Audi is still looking for its dance partner when it comes to developing the necessary tech. We’ve seen a lot of car companies pairing up with carriers, software-makers and other tech-specialists in developing their advanced car roadmap, and Audi seems to want to lean on someone with more expertise, too.
Audi is already working on self-driving tech, even without a dedicated subsidiary to do so: Its piloted driving project recently made headlines for including subtle, human-like cues to other drivers of its intent to change lanes, by drifting towards lane markers prior to initiating a merge.

In spite of the progress of car tech overall, the number of vehicles breaking down is actually spiking. According to Fortune, the American Automotive Association (AAA) tended to a record-high 32 million drivers with vehicle breakdowns last year. The main causes? A lot of flat tires, but also electronic keyless ignitions that sapped batteries and more.
AAA also found that relatively recent advancements like maintenance reminders and engine alerts haven’t lowered the amount of drivers stuck roadside. I asked AAA how drivers might avoid breakdowns, either through their own actions, or failing that, and what car OEMs can do to fix the mess.
When asked about possible tweaks with electronic key ignitions, an AAA spokesperson suggested that “consumers should keep their ‘smart’ key or fob at least 10 feet away from the car when it is not in use so inadvertent battery drains will be prevented.” Triple-A also advises that you “don’t leave the ‘smart’ key or fob in the car unnecessarily, or hang it on a hook in the garage next to the car overnight.”
AAA believes that automakers should go back to providing spare tires as standard equipment to prevent more calls related to flats. But the organization’s last piece of advice should be the most obvious.
“Overall, the best way to prevent roadside breakdowns is with proper vehicle maintenance,” AAA added. “While today’s vehicle technology incorporates maintenance reminders and dashboard alerts designed to prevent roadside trouble, drivers still must take action.”

Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler intends to up its spending on research and development, the company revealed during its quarterly earnings call on Thursday. The high-end car maker is going to route a lot more money toward areas key to the future of driving, including autonomous driving tech, a brand new generation of batteries for electric vehicles and alternative drive systems.
Daimler’s CEO Dieter Zetsche said the company is “adjusting” their plan in the electric car field, a change in strategy that reflects increased investment from Audi, as well as Tesla’s quick rise to becoming a kind of high-end electric brand cachet. While Zetsche didn’t put a number on spending into either electric, or into R&D efforts in general, he did say that spending on R&D for 2016 would be “significantly” higher than 2015’s roughly $7.3 billion spent.

1024,‘Graham’ shows how an evolved human body could survive a car accident,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/21/graham-shows-how-an-evolved-human-body-could-survive-a-car-accident/,2016/07/21,"
Human bodies aren’t evolving quickly enough to withstand the force of a major car accident using today’s auto technology.
To help illustrate this, Australia’s Transport Accident Commission has built Graham — a lifelike, interactive model made to show the bodily features that humans might be equipped with if we evolve to endure blunt force in crashes. Essentially, Graham is the only one out here that can survive a major collision on the road. Unless you can evolve to his level.
The auto safety project concentrates on Graham’s eight crucial body zones, including the brain, skull, face, neck, rib cage, skin, knees, and legs/feet. The study then goes zone-by-zone, describing how each body part would need to evolve to withstand such force during a crash.
For example, the TAC made Graham’s skull bigger, filling it with more cerebrospinal fluid and ligaments to prepare the brain for when a collision occurs, offering him greater safety.
Graham’s rib-cage protection was bolstered with a barrel-like chest with sacks between each of his ribs that would act like airbags during a crash.

And TAC gave Graham hoof-like legs with added joints that would allow him to spring up and out of the way during a crash to avoid enduring major force.
Hoof-like legs to minimize leg and foot injuries during an accident? Probably not evolutionary traits in our near futures. But that’s the point that TAC is trying to drive home — rather than leaving solutions to evolution, improved roads could help in the meantime.
“Cars have evolved a lot faster than humans and Graham helps us understand why we need to improve every aspect of our roads system to protect ourselves from our own mistakes,” TAC chief executive officer Joe Calafiore said in the organization’s press release.
TAC worked with an auto accident expert, trauma surgeon, and Melbourne artist to bring Graham to his lifelike state.

On Thursday, Reuters reported that Samsung invested $450 million in BYD Company Ltd., a Chinese automaker and rechargeable batteries firm. The Korean smartphone giant clearly isn’t about to let Google, Apple and Tesla have all the automotive fun.
Samsung said just last week that it was in negotiations with BYD to help improve the company’s automotive chips. But in a press release, BYD said it will initially pour Samsung’s investment into the growth of its battery production and research and development of new-energy vehicles.
Samsung is in good company with the investment, too. BYD is backed by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which owns just over 9 percent of the Chinese company. The Chinese company makes everything from gas-powered cars to hybrids, electric vehicles and even solar paneling.
After purchasing this stake in BYD, let’s see if Samsung makes additional moves to secure footing in the automotive industry. Google is leading the way for self-driving testing, and Apple is reportedly working on its own autonomous car.

1026,Honda and SoftBank partner to turn Asimo into KITT from Knight Rider,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/21/honda-softbank-cars-into-friends/,2016/07/21,"
Car and tech companies continue to partner up, but Honda and SoftBank’s newly-announced union is a little different from most. Rather than working on self-driving cars, or a more connected vehicle, Honda and SoftBank are working on making an artificial intelligence that can actually talk to and assist drivers in a way designed to foster more feelings of friendship between human and car.
If the aim is really friendliness, rather than bad-ass stunts designed to help David Hasselhoff nail bad guys, then Herbie the Love Bug might be a better analogy to what the Honda/SoftBank partnership aims to accomplish. And the track record of robots created by both companies suggests a softer side for any future car companion.
Honda’s Asimo is actually celebrating its sweet sixteen this year in October, and the humanoid robot is one of the most recognizable in the world. The bot has even been a guest on quiz shows, and literally made great strides when it learned to run in 2005.

But mobile network company SoftBank’s the one that has made more headlines with its robotics efforts recently: Its Pepper robot made its debut in 2014, and is intended to be used to “make people happy” according to the company, which sounds more like what this partnership aims to provide for drivers.
The stated goal is to “harmonize mobility with people,” according to the Associated Press. What that means in terms of how a car using the eventual tech would operate is anyone’s guess, but one of Pepper’s key traits is being able to recognize emotional swings  in the humans it deals with, and to temper its behavior appropriately as a result.
Full autonomy in cars may still be a long way off, but this Honda/SoftBank approach could act as an interesting interim step – not even partial autonomy, but a way to use AI to strengthen the connection between driver and vehicle, which could indeed help enhance the human driver’s skills. It worked for Hasselhoff and KITT, after all.

1027,Tesla and Uber have more in common than you might think,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/20/tesla-and-uber-have-more-in-common-than-you-might-think/,2016/07/20,"
Elon Musk’s new master plan catapults Tesla into a new market; car-sharing.
While the idea of Tesla car-sharing seems new, it is not the first time the company’s cars, coupled with autonomous technology, have come up in discussions about the sharing economy.
Back in 2015, Steve Jurvetson, a partner at Uber investor DFJ, told an audience that Uber’s Travis Kalanick had indicated he would buy every Tesla car produced if they could be made autonomous by 2020.
These were the days when it appeared a Uber and Tesla partnership could be on the horizon. Musk himself paused long enough on an earnings call to raise suspicions when discussing the possibility of such a partnership.
These days, it seems that Uber has gone its own way in developing an autonomous car solution. And with today’s announcement from Musk, it appears Tesla is doing the same.
“You will also be able to add your car to the Tesla shared fleet just by tapping a button on the Tesla phone app and have it generate income for you while you’re at work or on vacation, significantly offsetting and at times potentially exceeding the monthly loan or lease cost,” said Musk in his post.
Companies like Uber and Lyft have more in common with Tesla than would appear at first glance. Uber specifically has been quite vocal about its long-term vision and its need for autonomous vehicles.
Both Uber and Tesla used an initial product or service to enter a market with serious barriers to entry. For Uber, ride-sharing required serious human capital and powerful regulatory influence. Tesla needed to build a mass-produced automobile from scratch.
Uber is still burning cash in China and Tesla still needs to follow through on its costly Gigafactory, but for the most part, both companies have been successful in what they initially set out to do. Both companies have an expensive obsession with driverless cars. Uber is pushing to hire top talent from Carnegie Mellon and other top universities to develop and test autonomous technologies.
This puts Uber on a collision course with Tesla, but this is not new. Tesla is only completing the puzzle by using car-sharing as a means to boost vehicle utilization rates. Both companies are betting on autonomous driving to reduce transportation costs.
Uber needs costs low to open up transportation access to groups outside their current market. This means increasing availability in low-density regions, and ultimately convincing everyday Americans to ditch car-ownership. Tesla needs to decrease the cost of driving to increase access to electric vehicles and ultimately reduce electricity needs and the overall carbon footprint.

The greatest benefits of the sharing economy have yet to be seen. On the surface, companies like Uber are providing income to previously unemployed segments of the middle class. In the future, when car-sharing becomes automated, the greatest market efficiencies will come from reduced transportation costs. Kalanick himself has noted in the past that the most expensive part of an Uber ride is the driver. Ride-sharing can only replace car-ownership if prices decrease further.
Uber doesn’t need autonomous cars in the same way it needs market share in China, but the space provides long-term sustainability for the company. Similarly, Tesla could sustain itself on its current trajectory, but Tesla can achieve long-term relevancy with such an endeavor. For both companies, autonomous driving presents another high-growth opportunity that will continue to attract and retain top talent.
The key for both companies will be ensuring that their core-businesses are not neglected by means of future investment. Musk made it clear in his plan that opportunities exist in the near-term to develop public-transportation and cargo solutions that will ease the company towards its longer term goals.
The collision between the two companies is still far off. Just because Uber and Tesla are riding the same trend, the contest is not a zero-sum game. As Google and others increase spending on autonomous driving, the entire ecosystem benefits. Keeping an eye on R&D spending overall will be quite introspective into the strategies of all companies in the space.
Tesla can compete. Winning, on the other hand, is a matter of hedging the right bets on what the future of transportation will look like. Twenty years from now, it’s unlikely we will have an interest in outright purchasing an electric car or paying a hefty fee to be driven around in a gas guzzler.
We have reached out to both Uber and Lyft for comment and will update this post if we receive word from them.

1028,The 7 steps of Elon Musk’s “Master Plan”,https://techcrunch.com/gallery/dr-elon/,gallery/dr,CONTENT ERROR
1029,"Musk’s Master Plan has solar for everyone, but investors aren’t buying the dream — yet",https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/20/musks-master-plan-has-solar-for-everyone-but-investors-arent-buying-the-dream-yet/,2016/07/20,"
The Tesla “Master Plan Part Deux” published tonight by founder Elon Musk proposes numerous major projects, but perhaps the most far-reaching of them all is the plan to put solar panels on every house and a battery in every garage. And to do that, he not-so-subtly hints, Tesla and SolarCity will need to be more than friends.
“We need to combine and break down the barriers inherent to being separate companies,” Musk wrote. “That they are separate at all, despite similar origins and pursuit of the same overarching goal of sustainable energy, is largely an accident of history.”
That rather overstates it, of course, and he largely undercuts that position with the next sentence, which implies that both companies are only just now arriving at a position to work with one another.

All the same, it’s clearly a plea to the shareholders and investors who are skeptical of the financial alchemy by which combining two debts will produce a profit. They may not see as far as Musk does, but his long-distance vision seems to blind him to the difficulties right under his nose. What he and the others at Tesla have built is remarkable, but he only sees it as the beginning of a much longer journey, and there are plenty of people who’d like to get off — or at least take a breather.
Even the ones who share Musk’s faith must surely want a few more specifics when it comes to next steps. I mean, here’s his pitch:
“Create a smoothly integrated and beautiful solar-roof-with-battery product that just works, empowering the individual as their own utility, and then scale that throughout the world. One ordering experience, one installation, one service contact, one phone app.”
Sounds great, except each single aspect of that so-called plan is more than enough to fill any sane company’s plate! It’s an admirable goal, of course, and I don’t doubt the companies are capable of bringing it off in time. But it doesn’t make much of a case for the proposed acquisition — here, today. (Of course a more detailed plan has surely circulated internally, but if it were much more fleshed out than this, Musk is the type to say so.)
Not everyone moves at the speed of Musk, which is no doubt endlessly frustrating to him. But his numerous and glittering successes should comfort him in his frustration. It’s unlikely that anything he has built will go to waste (the Hyperloop, perhaps, but mostly because he didn’t build it), but he’ll need to do more than dream out loud if he wants Tesla’s weary backers to follow his lead.

1030,Elon Musk addresses concerns around Autopilot and its ‘beta’ label,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/20/elon-musk-addresses-concerns-around-autopilot-and-its-beta-label/,2016/07/20,"
Elon Musk’s Tesla’s ‘Master Plan, Part Deux’ contains his strongest response yet to concerns around Autopilot, the subject of an ongoing National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigation. Unsurprisingly, Musk is standing by the merits Autopilot and its impact on driver safety.
“According to the recently released 2015 NHTSA report, automotive fatalities increased by 8 percent to one death every 89 million miles. Autopilot miles will soon exceed twice that number and the system gets better every day,” the Tesla CEO wrote in a section of his Part 2 plan labeled ‘Autonomy’. “It would no more make sense to disable Tesla’s Autopilot, as some have called for, than it would to disable autopilot in aircraft, after which our system is named.”
He then proceeded to explain why the term “beta” being attached to Autopilot is little more than a formality based on internal naming standards at this point.
“It is also important to explain why we refer to Autopilot as ‘beta,'” Musk continued. “This is not beta software in any normal sense of the word. Every release goes through extensive internal validation before it reaches any customers. It is called beta in order to decrease complacency and indicate that it will continue to improve (Autopilot is always off by default). Once we get to the point where Autopilot is approximately 10 times safer than the US vehicle average, the beta label will be removed.”
Autopilot has been under intense scrutiny since a fatal Model S crash involving the feature occurred this past May. That led the NHTSA to launch an investigation into Autopilot late last month. Consumer Reports followed last week by calling on Tesla to disable Autopilot until it can be proved much safer, but NHTSA head Mark Rosekind also said at a San Francisco conference this week that “no one incident” will stop the organization from promoting the development of highly  automated driving.
From what Musk laid out Wednesday night, Tesla has no plans to discontinue its efforts towards developing automated driving systems, either. In fact, Musk described a desired future state in which self-driving Tesla’s form a shared fleet of vehicles available to people needing a ride on demand.

Elon Musk plans to steer Tesla towards fully autonomous driving, car sharing, and cargo transport, according to the long awaited blog post on the company’s website. A fully solar power ecosystem driven in-part by SolarCity will help Musk and Co. get there.
Musk has been teasing the master plan part II for days. What would be in it? Would Tesla cars fly? Would they go to space? What does Lana Del Rey have to do with it? Why is Elon Musk talking about crack on Twitter?
After a near infinite number of browser refreshes, we now know.
For a quick breakdown, check out our gallery: The 7 steps of Elon Musk’s “Master Plan”
Tesla is doubling down on not just autopilot but full autonomy. To get there, Musk expects a total of 6 billion miles of test-driving will be needed. Right now, fleet learning is happening at 3 million miles per day.
Tesla is also prioritizing development of heavy-duty trucks and high passenger-density urban transport. These products will be unveiled over the next year. The Tesla Semi specifically will support cargo and transportation services. The driver role is expected to transition to one of a fleet manager. A Tesla ecosystem of smaller connected utility vehicles including busses would be able to provide convenience, increase road safety and reduce traffic congestion. Such a system benefits everyone, not just the technocratic elite. Additional capacity, door-to-door service, and non-cellular methods to interact with the system would benefit groups yet to be touched by traditional ride-sharing.
The company is taking a page from Uber and Lyft and raising them with artificial intelligence. Tesla sees itself taking on qualities of a transportation company but rather than a human driver, Tesla will come to you autonomously. To supplement an early lack of supply in vehicles, the company will operate a fleet of its own.
“You will also be able to add your car to the Tesla shared fleet just by tapping a button on the Tesla phone app and have it generate income for you while you’re at work or on vacation, significantly offsetting and at times potentially exceeding the monthly loan or lease cost,” said Musk in his post. “This dramatically lowers the true cost of ownership to the point where almost anyone could own a Tesla. Since most cars are only in use by their owner for 5% to 10% of the day, the fundamental economic utility of a true self-driving car is likely to be several times that of a car which is not.”
Pushing to bring down costs for the average consumer appears central to the new plan. Like Ford before him, Musk is prioritizing manufacturing optimization to bring costs down in the upcoming Model 3 and forthcoming vehicles.
In line with Tesla’s updated goals, the company quietly changed its URL earlier this week from Teslamotors.com to just Tesla.com. Tesla is no-longer simply a car company.
Even before the URL change, Musk had been hinting at this shift. In the first part of the master plan released in 2006, Musk described that his draw to the company was a desire “to help expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy.”
Musk deliberately said solar, not wind or hydroelectric, but solar.
Even on this alone, a Tesla acquisition of SolarCity could have been predicted. Musk expanded on his ideas to include a roadmap that has guided the company for a decade.
√ Build sports car
√ Use that money to build an affordable car
√ Use that money to build an even more affordable car
√ While doing above, also provide zero emission electric power generation options
Tesla has done a pretty good job at first targeting customers “prepared to pay a premium,” and then “driving down the market.” The new plan picks up where the old one left off and provides guidance on how electric power can move beyond the car and into the home.

The 7 steps of Elon Musk's ""Master Plan""

Tesla has already started moving into uncharted territory with regards to its development of Powerpack and Powerwall and the upcoming opening of the Gigafactory. Batteries were a small part of Musk’s plan but have grown to be a major focal point of the business. The new plan is to coalesce all of energy generation and storage around a single ordering and installation process. This means Tesla batteries are entering a long term intimate relationship with SolarCity solar panels.
The new plan, focuses on the solar ecosystem as a whole. Lot of new artificial intelligence and machine learning technology has rolled into place over the last decade and Tesla wants to take advantage of that as well.
The new simplified plan looks like this:
Ο Create stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage
Ο Expand the electric vehicle product line to address all major segments
Ο Develop a self-driving capability that is 10X safer than manual via massive fleet learning
Ο Enable your car to make money for you when you aren’t using it
Tesla investors have been patient so far, but that was called into question amidst Tesla’s plans to acquire SolarCity. The company’s stock is worth 13 times its IPO value, but lately has been categorized as a risky investment by analysts. Dreaming big is easier as a startup. The larger a company grows, the harder it becomes to steer the rudder. I’m not one to doubt Musk, and given how accurately he forecasted and accomplished his last plan, others would be wise not to either.

China has issued a temporary ban on the highway testing of autonomous cars. According to Bloomberg, the country’s auto regulators have warned automakers to keep their autonomous vehicle testing off highways until official rules are in place.
China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology is working with law enforcement to create uniform regulations for self-driving testing. The time frame of when those regulations will be finalized is currently unknown, though.
This temporary ban could affect Volvo, which wanted regular citizens behind the wheel of autonomous vehicles on public Chinese roads. In addition, the ban could stifle the growth of China’s own Chongqing Changan Automobile Co. The company’s self-driving car, outfitted with radar and cameras, made a 1,200-mile trek in the country this past April.
There has been increased scrutiny on autonomous car technology worldwide since federal regulators launched an investigation last month into a fatal Tesla Model S crash involving Autopilot from this past May.

1033,"Car sharing leads to reduced car ownership and emissions in cities, study finds",https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/19/car-sharing-leads-to-reduced-car-ownership-and-emissions-in-cities-study-finds/,2016/07/19,"
Cars are one of the top contributors to greenhouse gas emissions globally, and cars in cities can be especially heavy with their contributions, owing to traffic and population density. And while encouraging everyone to bike or use public transit probably isn’t going to convince everyone to ditch car ownership, car sharing services seem to be winning more city denizens over, and a new study shows that the results of said services are good, both for the environment and for reducing unnecessary personal budget burdens.
The study (full PDF available here), conducted by research group Innovative Mobility Research (IMR) working out of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at UC Berkeley, looked specifically at one-way car sharing in North America, with a focus on car2go since it has the largest reach and is present in a number of major urban markets. With one-way car sharing, members of the service can pick up a car at one spot and drop it at another — here in Toronto, for instance, car2go vehicles can be picked up on city streets, in city-run “Green P” parking lots and at the airport.
The IMR’s study focused on car2go members in Calgary, San Diego, Seattle, Vancouver and Washington, and relies on self-reported info derived from polling car2go users, combined with vehicle activity data provided by car2go for the purposes of the study.
What they found was that both vehicle ownership and emissions from driving dropped as a result of car sharing programs being present in these cities. Reduced emissions are a reflection of reduced driving overall, as car2go members seem not to use cars as much as car owners, despite using public transportation just as much or even less than before car sharing was introduced. In the vast majority of cases, however, respondents reported walking more.
In terms of ownership, the survey found that a small but non-trivial number of respondents either sold or didn’t bother to buy a personal vehicle as a result of having a one-way car sharing system in place. In total across all five cities, the study suggests that between four and nine owned vehicles were suppressed (i.e. sold or never purchased to begin with) per car sharing vehicle present in the city. That represents a huge shift in the total number of vehicles on the road, and the resulting cost from a manufacturing, ownership/usage and disposal perspective, if accurate.
Anecdotally, car2go has done well here in Toronto. In addition to expanding pick-up/drop-off points from just parking lots to any residential street, it has added four-door Mercedes vehicles to its fleet (in addition to the standard smart fortwos that make up the bulk of its offerings). I’ve heard from a fellow TechCrunch writer that, again anecdotally, car2go has also become pretty commonplace in Seattle.
Car sharing is still far from being the norm among city-dwellers when it comes to transportation options, but this study shows that even modest membership numbers could have big impact on the health of a city.

1034,Attention nerds: Chrysler announces bug bounty program,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/19/attention-nerds-chrysler-announces-bug-bounty-program/,2016/07/19,"
If you like poking, prodding, and proving big corporations wrong, has FCA US got a challenge for you. FCA US is the umbrella company for Fiat, Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge, and Ram, and it wants you to find potential vulnerabilities in their vehicles’ cybersecurity systems. And they’ll give you money for it.
FCA US put its bounty program up on Bugcrowd, a community of cybersecurity researchers. There are only a few rules for bug bounty hunters, including providing the information FCA US would need to reproduce and validate the identified vulnerability. The company also asks that bounty hunters not destroy data, interrupt FCA US services, or “modify, access, or retain data that does not belong to you.”
What do you get in return for following these basic guidelines? First of all, you get cash money, between $150 and $1500 per bug, depending on its severity. Also, you get FCA US’s promise that it “will not take legal action against nor ask law enforcement to investigate researchers participating in the program” — as long as you follow the rules.
FCA US is specifically looking for bugs found in UConnect systems, especially apps for iOS and Android. They’re also asking the community to test for bugs in hardware they own or have access to for testing, like tire pressure sensors and remote keyless entry systems. Basically, if you think you can hack into an FCA US vehicle and compromise its cybersecurity, you stand to make a few hundred bucks.
There are some off-limits areas, like dealer websites and DDOS attacks. To see the exact parameters, check out the Bugcrowd page for the FCA US project.
You may recall the infamous Jeep hack last summer, which FCA US responded to quickly if not elegantly. The company apparently decided that if hackers gonna hack, it might as well harness their nerd power and pay them for finding holes in the code.

1035,Volkswagen aims for more electric cars by 2020 amid ongoing emissions scandal,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/19/volkswagen-aims-for-more-electric-cars-by-2020-amid-ongoing-emissions-scandal/,2016/07/19,"
Volkswagen is trying to mash the dash into the future, but its ongoing emissions scandal remains its biggest roadblock. And it doesn’t look like the trudge from the crisis will be sliding into the rearview mirror anytime soon.
On Tuesday, the embattled automaker confirmed with the Wall Street Journal that it plans to build electric vehicles in North America by 2020 in an attempt to change its soiled reputation. Hours later on the same day, Reuters reported that three states filed separate lawsuits against VW. New York, Maryland and Massachusetts are alleging that the company violated their environmental laws and covered up its diesel-cheating scheme.
Before its emissions scandal even made international headlines last September, VW announced a plan to roll out with 20 electric cars and plug-in hybrids by 2020. They boldly predicted that their new cars will be smartphones on wheels. Tuesday’s confirmation for EVs was relegated to North America, but it didn’t reveal much more. When we asked Volkswagen about the plan in greater detail, our email wasn’t immediately returned.
Last month, VW struck a $14.7 billion settlement to remedy its emissions scandal. The company already has its e-Golf hatchback on the road, but ramping up its electric fleet by 2020 would seemingly make strides towards becoming a cleaner brand.
“We believe that this country, especially in urban mobility, will have a very strong shift from petrol engines into hybridization and electric cars,” Hinrich Woebcken, the new head of Volkswagen AG’s U.S. division, told the Wall Street Journal. “We are heavily investing in this one — including production in this North American region.”
If VW does deliver on its plan for electric vehicles in four years, Tesla could have more competition. That’s sort of ironic, considering Tesla CEO Elon Musk signed an open letter to the California Air Resources Board (CARB) last year, asking that VW accelerate its EV development instead of fixing compromised diesel models. This could get pretty interesting.
In the meantime, VW has a lot of work to do.

1036,Ford partners with Jose Cuervo to make car parts out of agave plants,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/18/ford-partners-with-jose-cuervo-to-make-car-parts-out-of-agave-plants/,2016/07/18,"
A tequila brand and car company joining forces isn’t exactly a marriage made in marketing heaven. So what brought Ford and Jose Cuervo together?
On Tuesday, the two companies announced a partnership to explore how the tequila distributor’s leftover agave plant fibers can be used to produce more sustainable bioplastic parts in the automaker’s vehicles. Currently, Ford and Jose Cuervo are testing the agave-derived bioplastics for parts including wiring harnesses, HVAC units and storage bins.
Initial feedback from this pilot stage shows that agave has strong durability and aesthetic qualities for the aforementioned interior and exterior parts. If the plant winds up being used on Ford’s cars permanently, it could further reduce vehicles’ weight and lower energy consumption across its lineup.
And there won’t be a shortage, as Jose Cuervo harvests between 200 and 300 tons of agave daily.

“They’re shredding, mashing and extracting the juice and what’s left over that nobody knows what to do with? The fibers,” Debbie Mielewski, Ford’s senior technical leader of the sustainability research department, told me. “They sent us some treated fibers and we were able to chop it and compound it into plastic.”
Agave use continues Ford’s evolution of the greening of its plastics through use of “environmental, plant-based materials” wherever possible, Mielewski said. Back in 2008, Ford used soy foam as a replacement for petroleum oil in the seat cushions and headrests of its iconic Mustang. Today, Ford has soy foam in seat cushions and headrests in every single vehicle across its lineup in North America. Mielewski says Ford utilizes over five million pounds of soy oil annually.
That served as a lesson to keep looking for even ‘greener’ plant-based materials. Ford pinpointed wheat straw to fortify plastic bins of its Flex SUV, which is built in the city of Oakville in Canada.
If this pilot stage with agave is fruitful, the plant fibers could join soy foam, wheat straw, castor oil, kenaf fiber, cellulose, wood, coconut fiber and rice hulls; the eight sustainable-based materials used for car parts by the automaker today.
And Mielewski says the company is “looking at plants that grow very quickly,” citing algae and bamboo to be used for greener plastic parts as well. Ford is even working with carbon dioxide itself.
“Instead of releasing it into the atmosphere and greenhouse gas, you can build polymer molecules out of it,”  she says. “We have made good foam — not in production yet — but 50 percent carbon dioxide. So, wouldn’t it be beautiful if one day, instead of releasing CO2, we could use it to make various plastics on the car?”
Ford says there’s 400 pounds of plastic on a typical vehicle, so there are plenty of parts remaining that can incorporate materials from sustainable sources like agave.

1037,Self-driving Mercedes-Benz bus takes a milestone 12-mile trip,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/18/self-driving-mercedes-benz-bus-takes-a-milestone-12-mile-trip/,2016/07/18,"
CityPilot has taken a key early step towards fully autonomous public transportation: The Mercedes-Benz self-driving bus program saw one of its Future Bus vehicles drive 20 km (or around 12.4 miles) in the Netherlands, on a route that connected Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport with the nearby town of Haarlem. To make the trip, the bus had to stop at traffic lights, pass through tunnels, and navigate among pedestrians.
This is a big win for the program, which owes its origins to the transport truck-focused Highway Pilot program debuted by Mercedes two years ago. That autonomous vehicle program didn’t face the added challenges of navigating an urban environment, however, which makes the Future Bus successful test run a significant achievement.

Future Bus isn’t just a brainy piece of utilitarian tech, however. Mercedes has focused on making sure that it’s well-suited to the city of the future, and accordingly put a lot of time into designing the vehicle’s interior. According to the company’s official press site, the busses have three separate zones designed based on how long of a trip a passenger is sign to be on board for, and there are displays for showing entertainment and other media, as well as a ceiling designed to resemble a forested canopy.
Look at that swank interior.
One of the key ingredients of the CityPilot program is integration with city infrastructure along its route of travel: The Future Bus I fully networked, meaning it can communicate with traffic lights along the route for cues on changing lights. An onboard close-range camera array also manages “fingerprint”-level recognition of asphalt detail, comparing it against previous trips to watch out for variances and keep things on track.
The autonomous functions of the vehicle manage speeds of up to 70km/h (around 43mph) and also takes care of navigating to raised bus stops along the route, slowing down and stopping to pick passengers up, pulling to within 2 inches from the curb.
Short-range autonomous buses are already getting deployed, mostly in controlled privately-owned settings around the world, but what this Mercedes pilot shows is a successful real-world test of what could be a core component of future pubic transportation systems.

1038,How USA Swimming trains with BMW’s Motion Tracking System for the 2016 Olympics,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/18/how-usa-swimming-trains-with-bmws-motion-tracking-system-for-the-2016-olympics/,2016/07/18,"
BMW might have found a low-risk way to test its autonomous driving systems — in the pool. Wait…what?
For the past six years, BMW has been the official mobility partner of the U.S. Olympic Committee. As part of the role, the automaker has created a customized motion tracking system for USA Swimming, treating American swimmers like they’re autonomous cars in chlorine.
How? Well, on the road to Rio for the 2016 Olympics, BMW is using what it calls its new “taillight” solution. That has the company implementing LEDs, just as they would on their cars, but as illuminated markers on swimmers’ bodies. The lights illuminate their paths underwater, allowing coaches to measure all of their movements more efficiently.
LEDS are mounted onto swimmers’ wrists, shoulders, hips, knees, ankles and toes. The mounting system was 3D printed, by the way. An underwater camera then interfaces with the motion tracking technology, and BMW’s software enables coaches to analyze swimmers’ dolphin kick.
Their technique can be scrutinized movement by movement, pinpointing  limb and joint angles, with quantitative feedback. Prior to this point, BMW had fit adhesive markers on the same joint locations on swimmers, sans the LEDs. Obviously, this tool with the LEDs takes a deeper dive into analyzing swimmers.

Peter Falt, Director of BMW Group Designworks, told me that the system was customized to “hold up to the intense forces of Olympic swimmers,” but also “disappear, meaning that they are not noticeable by the swimmer or impede their motion in any way.” Falt explains that was important to “ensure the training didn’t create a different feeling or result than would be experienced in real competition.”

At the heart of the BMW’s motion tracking system for USA Swimming is two algorithms designed to detect and adaptively track a swimmer’s motion. One of them, computer vision, is used in the automaker’s cars to identify humans, park distance, lane deviation and active cruise control. The combination of computer vision and software algorithms is a core aspect of BMW’s automated driving systems as well.
BMW’s original motion tracking system helped USA Swimming stroke its way to 16 of America’s 46 gold medals in the 2012 Olympics. Now improved with LEDs, the squad has high hopes for the technology in Rio and beyond.
“The goal is that by comparing measurements to performance over time, we can use BMW’s motion tracking tool to hone in on technique adjustments that work best for each individual swimmer,” said Russell Mark, USA Swimming’s National Team performance consultant. “The tool is an exploratory project that we’ll continue evaluating over time, but our hope is that the potential of its outcome can make a significant impact on the future generation of swimmers.”
The motion tracking system is one of four technology projects that BMW has produced under its sponsorship as the U.S. Olympic Committee’s official mobility partner. The other three include: a velocity measurement system for long jumpers, a two-man bobsled, and a carbon fiber racing wheelchair for the U.S. Paralympics Track and Field Team.

1039,Germany wants a ‘black box’ in any car with self-driving features,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/18/germany-wants-a-black-box-in-any-car-with-self-driving-features/,2016/07/18,"
Cars that drive themselves should be able to account for themselves, or so goes the thinking behind new legislation proposed by Germany’s transport ministry. The country is planning new laws that require cars equipped with self-driving features to also include a black box, Reuters reports, similar to the flight recorder required on aircraft.
Germany’s future legislation, which will still need to be approved by other ministries before being put to a vote and entered into law, would require car manufacturers to install a recorder that tracks when an autopilot system is engaged, when the driver is controlling the vehicle manually, when the system asked the driver to take over and when it was disengaged.
The law also requires that drivers remain seated at the wheel while a self-driving system is operating, but specifically allows that a human behind the wheel not have to pay attention to traffic or concentrate specifically on surrounding traffic. It’s yet another example of regulators looking to put more defined terms on what they expect from car-makers working on autonomy, whereas previously there has been precious little in the way of oversight.
Some manufacturers already monitor use of their self-driving systems. Tesla vehicles track trip data, recording info about what’s going on with the vehicle in case of accidents. Elon Musk tweeted that “onboard vehicle logs” revealed Autopilot wasn’t engaged in a recent Model X rollover accident in Pennsylvania. These logs have also been cited in a number of other incidents, and provide data that is much more finely detailed than what you might expect. It’s unclear, however, if this kind of system will match the legislation’s requirements.
It benefits just about everyone in the mix to have comprehensive data recorded regarding self-driving cars, since data is the key to improving the systems. Where not all parties might agree, however, will be on who has access to the data, at what times, and with what degree of transparency – and that’s where the emerging regulatory picture is likely to start creating debate between public and private interests.

But in taking to his Twitter account between late Thursday night and early Friday morning, the Tesla CEO couldn’t help but announce improvements to the automaker’s radar … which isn’t Lidar, even though the end results sound awfully Lidar-like.

So, if the ramping up of radar brings Tesla’s technology that much closer to what Lidar would deliver, then why not just use Lidar? Perhaps, Musk just doesn’t want to give up his forward drive with radar and take steps back to include the same Lidar technology he has put down on several occasions.
For what it’s worth, Musk did back up his tweet with advantages that radar delivers over Lidar.

We wonder if Musk would ever cave in and just adopt Lidar as Tesla’s competition in self-driving technology — most prominently, Google — is doing.

1041,"Senate committee calls out Elon Musk, wants answers on Tesla Autopilot",https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/14/senate-committee-calls-out-elon-musk-wants-answers-on-tesla-autopilot/,2016/07/14,"
The U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation has called out Tesla CEO Elon Musk to answer some questions about the company’s Autopilot technology, and what the Silicon Valley automaker is doing to educate drivers about it.
Sen. John Thune, chairman for the committee, issued the letter today seeking a response from Musk and Tesla no later than July 29th.
The inquiry was prompted after a fatal Tesla crash in Florida, which we reported on earlier. During that crash, the driver had Autopilot engaged.
In a second crash in Pennsylvania, which was not fatal, the Detroit Free Press reports that the driver thought he had Autopilot engaged.
Musk issued a public statement today, however, that according to investigators’ findings, Autopilot was not on in Pennsylvania, and in fact could have prevented that crash.
The Senate inquiry follows several federal agencies’ more formal investigations into Tesla’s technology business practices.
As TechCrunch previously reported, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is trying to determine whether Tesla had an obligation to notify its shareholders of the Florida crash sooner than it did.
The National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are also looking into what exactly happened during the Florida crash, and whether or not Autopilot features contributed in any way.
Sen. Thune published and publicized the committee’s letter on the same day that Consumer Reports called on Tesla to disable Autopilot’s hands-free mode until the technology is further developed.
Gail Gottehrer, a partner at Connecticut law firm Axinn, who specializes in class action defense, management-side labor and employment litigation, said everyone is concerned about liability following in this market, for good reason.
They also were when Google’s self-driving car collided with a bus in California in February — a minor accident with no fatalities — she noted.
“This tech is so advanced and so complicated. Everyone wants to figure out how to regulate it so that we can get self-driving vehicles out on the road, where it could be very beneficial for disabled people, seniors, and to prevent thousands of deaths,” she said. “But it’s hard to know where to start and how to do it effectively. Everyone will be watching to see what NHTSA’s guidelines are as a next step.”
The attorney, who does not represent any automotive clients, or have any connections to Tesla, said she believes specifically “There’s certainly no failure to warn on Tesla’s part.”
Tesla gives its customers more than the small print, she said. There are meaningful disclosures that their cars aren’t toys, and if one does not operate a vehicle safely, a driver can make even the safest car unsafe no matter how well it is manufactured.
Questions remain for regulators and politicians looking out for public safety above profits or rapid advances in technology.
For example, does a tech or automotive company have an obligation to reach out to people who are using their products the wrong way; and how comfortable is the public with some people being part of a beta test out on the road?

The Tesla Model X that crashed in Pennsylvania on July 1 had autopilot disabled at the time, Elon Musk announced on Twitter. This info comes straight from the vehicle’s own logs.


Onboard vehicle logs show Autopilot was turned off in Pennsylvania crash. Moreover, crash would not have occurred if it was on.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 14, 2016



Tesla has been criticized over the last weeks for, as some say anyhow, offering its Autopilot semi-autonomous driving feature too early and using public roads as proving grounds. Consumer Reports just today called for the company to disable the feature until it’s safer.
The news that it wasn’t even in use at the time of the crash should silence some critics, but hardly all: The full story of the crash isn’t known yet, and while Autopilot does not appear to be the cause, it may yet have contributed. Until a more thorough investigation yields its results, it may be best to withhold judgment — not that anyone will do that.
This story is developing; more info as we get it.

1043,Ford shows how humans and robots work hand-in-hand on its assembly line,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/14/ford-shows-how-humans-and-robots-work-hand-in-hand-on-its-assembly-line/,2016/07/14,"
Your next colleague could be an industrial robot. Ford has a pilot project which could pave the way for humans and robots to eventually work hand-in-hand in all of the automaker’s assembly lines worldwide.
The automaker has new collaborative robots, known as co-bots, helping workers fit shock absorbers to Fiesta cars in Ford’s assembly plant in Cologne, Germany. The task involves co-bots and employees working together to ensure a perfect fit every time. If this trial run goes smoothly, Ford could ramp up its co-bots corps in more of its plants in the near future.
“If we deem that is efficient enough, we can take a look at including them in other plants,” Ford rep  Karl Henkel told me today. “The co-bots are an ‘and’ proposition and not a ‘or’ proposition. It’s not ‘can this robot do what a worker cannot do?’ They’re complementary, working together as a team.”
Ford strategically picked fitting shock absorbers as the task because it’s typically a strenuous job that keeps workers on the assembly line for seven to eight hours. Co-bots, which stand just over three feet, help with that. Take a look at the co-bots and assembly workers collaborate in action.

According to Henkel, Ford’s trial run with the worker-robot collaboration in Cologne is part of the company furthering its investigation in Industry 4.0 Automation, which embraces these co-bots and other automated technologies on the assembly line and beyond.

1044,Consumer Reports calls for Tesla to disable ‘Autopilot’ until it can be made safer,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/14/consumer-reports-calls-for-tesla-to-disable-autopilot-until-it-can-be-made-safer/,2016/07/14,"
Was Tesla’s Autopilot mode too much autonomy, too soon? Consumer Reports seems to think so.
On Thursday, the publication called for the automaker to disable its hands-free operation until the system can be made safer. Consumer Reports came to this decision after its experts concluded that some Tesla owners believe that the vehicles can drive themselves, creating the hazardous situations of drivers not being engaged enough to react to emergencies quickly.
In the report, Laura MacCleery, vice president of consumer policy and mobilization for Consumer Reports, said:
By marketing their feature as ‘Autopilot,’ Tesla gives consumers a false sense of security. In the long run, advanced active safety technologies in vehicles could make our roads safer. But today, we’re deeply concerned that consumers are being sold a pile of promises about unproven technology. ‘Autopilot’ can’t actually drive the car, yet it allows consumers to have their hands off the steering wheel for minutes at a time. Tesla should disable automatic steering in its cars until it updates the program to verify that the driver’s hands are on the wheel.
Tesla wasn’t having it at all, firing back its own biting response to Consumer Reports and standing firmly by the feature:
Tesla is constantly introducing enhancements, proven over millions of miles of internal testing, to ensure that drivers supported by Autopilot remain safer than those operating without assistance. We will continue to develop, validate, and release those enhancements as the technology grows. While we appreciate well-meaning advice from any individual or group, we make our decisions on the basis of real-world data, not speculation by media.
Ouch. The automaker added that “130 million miles have been driven on Autopilot, with one confirmed fatality.”
Consumer Reports’s call for action comes a week after federal regulators sent a letter to Tesla, requesting details about Autopilot, including logs of when the technology has alerted drivers to take over steering.
That request is part of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s continued investigation of Tesla’s Autopilot. The automaker has faced scrutiny over the feature since a fatal Model S crash involving Autopilot on May 7. Last week, Tesla vowed that drivers using Autopilot are safer than regular drivers.

It has never been more clear that transformational change to one of the world’s largest industries is just around the corner. Car ownership is supposed to change — and when it does, it is predicted to be one of the most monumental displacements of wealth the world economy has ever seen.
But there are a lot of conflicting opinions and information out there. Industry experts and headlines are telling us that Tesla will rule the world, car manufacturers are becoming mobility companies and Uber and Lyft mean the end of traditional car ownership as we know it. They’re also saying that car dealerships will die at the hands of online car-buying sites such as Beepi, Carvana, Vroom and Shift. On the contrary, headlines are also touting that vehicle sales are at all-time highs, trucks are the leading category of new car sales and millennials are buying cars more than ever.
There’s also the looming question of autonomous driving technology. Uber and Lyft want self-driving cars to replace their drivers ASAP, and companies like Apple and GM are spending aggressively to position themselves for success in a theoretical, autonomous mobility landscape. But even Google, which has been developing this technology since 2009, is unsure if fully autonomous cars can become viable within the next 30 years.
What is unequivocal is that there’s a lot of noise around the future of transportation. Like anyone who lives in Silicon Valley, I believe change is coming and that current car ownership models are ripe for disruption. But with personal car sales at an all-time high, the question is when — and how? The assumed agents of change are the likes of Tesla, Uber, Google, Apple or Ford, but lost in all of these predictions is the linchpin for the entire auto industry. That’s the unsexy, yet enormous world of auto finance — the huge market that makes it all work.
Financing props up the entire auto industry.
To put it in perspective, auto loan balances in the U.S. total more than $1.06 trillion right now. That number doesn’t even include the enormous leasing market. The largest auto lenders in the U.S. are also household names: banks like Ally, Wells Fargo, Chase and Capital One, and finance arms of car manufacturers like Toyota, GM and Ford. Auto loans, as an asset class, trail only mortgages and student loan balances.
It’s clearly a massive market, but why does that matter? It matters because U.S. car sales are inextricably linked to a robust auto finance market. Indeed, 86 percent of new car sales in the U.S. are financed. Without individual financing products, car sales don’t happen. Financing props up the entire auto industry. In fact, the U.S. is far more reliant on auto finance than other countries. In China, where current new car sales outpace the U.S., only 26 percent of new car sales are financed.
What does that mean for the future?
New types of cars like the Tesla 3 or the Chevy Bolt will continue to emerge, and their features will be heralded as ushering in the future of transportation. For the most part, however, these innovative vehicles are going to be consumed in the traditional manner: They will be personally financed.

Ford Launches New Programs To Make Driving And Car Ownership Less Of A Hassle

That can’t be the future of car ownership. With the rise of companies like Uber and Lyft, it’s clear that we will need to see advances in new ownership models to support tomorrow’s transportation landscape. In fact, Uber recently received a $1 billion credit facility led by Goldman Sachs to fund new car leases. Uber (and Wall Street) are also recognizing the need for more flexibility with this deal — especially at a time when Americans are making larger monthly payments than ever on their cars and taking out record-size auto loans.
Other flexible vehicle access products like Ford’s Credit Link (shared vehicle leasing program) and GM’s Maven (on-demand car rentals) give us a glimpse into what the future of car ownership may look like. These types of emerging products will only be successful with a robust technology infrastructure — a stark departure from the differentiators in the auto finance market today.
If we see a shift away from personal vehicle ownership and households no longer own, on average, 2.06 cars, then this will require an entirely new auto finance infrastructure. Ultimately, Google’s self-driving cars may become ubiquitous — but we’ll have to displace a lot of big names in today’s $1 trillion auto finance market to get there.

1046,Land Rover’s lead engineer explains autonomous off-road driving,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/13/land-rovers-lead-engineer-explains-autonomous-off-road-driving/,2016/07/13,"
When you’re Land Rover, you can’t just test connected and autonomous vehicles on regular roads. You have to live up to your rugged, but polished brand, simultaneously. That’s precisely why the automaker is testing off-road connected convoy research vehicles.
It’s all a part of the company’s ambitious plan to create a fleet of 100-plus research vehicles over the next four years. The goal is to eventually get to the point where full autonomous off-roading is the new norm, through continuous testing of its connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technologies.
To prepare for that day, Land Rover published the video below on Wednesday, showing two off-road connected convoy research vehicles communicating with each other. I spoke with Land Rover’s lead engineer for the project, Matt Reed, who explained how the connected vehicles communicated via Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) boxes installed in each SUV to successfully off-road.

“Currently, what we’ve got is two DSRC boxes from a company called Cohda Wireless and they use their software put into the car by their vehicle CAN Bus [network],” Reed explained. “The CAN Bus is a vehicle-level network, which all current OEMs [Original Equipment Manufacturers] have, which contains lots of the driving data. You’ll have everything from ignition the car is in to things like the vehicle speed, the direction of travel, the GPS location, all of that information, which is used by the vehicle’s internal module to do everything from cruise control to turning your lights on and off.”
“These boxes are connected to that network and we fix the signals that we want to look at, such as vehicle articulation, vehicle speeds and location, and then using that network, we pick off the information, which could be transmitted to a second car,” he continued. “The transmission is through those boxes and it’s using a 5.9 GHz DSRC.”
Land Rover also leaned on the company’s Terrain Response settings to adjust to whatever uneven off-road surface the connected vehicles encountered during this experiment.

Although there was a professional driver in this test, as the technology improves and full autonomy is achieved, Reed says a lead car would be able to off-road across tricky terrain, with a second car without any input following that exact route.
Reed adds that with time there’s also potential to integrate mobile phone communications to the vehicle-to-vehicle data sharing. “So, for certain applications, you could have one car using a cell phone to connect to another car, which then DSRC connects to it,” he added.
While that might be getting ahead of Land Rover’s plan, the next step is to continue to beef up its fleet of research vehicles to further test its CAV technologies. Just imagine the day when self-driving vehicles are off-roading in abundance.

1047,Tesla introduces a more affordable Model X,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/13/tesla-introduces-a-more-affordable-model-x/,2016/07/13,"Tesla is doing its part to slash the sticker prices on its vehicles. On Wednesday, the electric-vehicle automaker introduced its Model X 60D, which carries a starting price tag of $64,500 (after incentives), compared to the original Model X’s $80,000 starting price.
We guess that’s more affordable to Tesla…sigh. According to Tesla’s website, the Model X 60D has a 200-mile range and can hit zero to 60 miles per hour in six-seconds flat with a top speed of 130 mph. The X 60D can be upgraded later via a software update to 75 kWh, increasing its range by nearly 20 percent.
This follows Tesla additionally returning a more affordable Model S 60 for $66,000 upon getting deluged with heavy demand for the Model 3 this past April. Of course, the latter vehicle is the company’s most affordable with a $35,000 price tag.

1048,Nissan’s highway self-driving system hits Japanese roads in August,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/13/nissan-self-driving/,2016/07/13,"
Nissan has a new autonomous driving system called ProPILOT, and it’s coming to its first production vehicle in August. ProPILOT, a self-driving feature designed for use in single-lane highway driving situation, arrives in the Nissan Serena first, which is currently set to go on sale next month.
Likely in light of recent events faced by Tesla around its own Autopilot self-driving tech, Nissan is very clearly laying out what ProPILOT is – and what it isn’t. In a press release, the company notes that ProPILOT is single-lane, as mentioned (Autopilot can manage lane changes) and that it controls steering, acceleration and braking, and is designed to be used when traffic is heavy and the going is slow, or during extended commutes.
Like other cruise-assist features you may have seen before, ProPILOT can automatically manage the distance between your car and any leading car, between speeds ranging from about 18 mph to about 60 mph. It also keeps the car in the lane, using a monocular 360-degree camera system communicating with an on-board processing system provided by Mobileye (the same tech provider that powers Tesla’s Autopilot, as well as drive-assist features from BMW, GM, Volvo and others) to watch for lane markers and vehicles out front.

One of ProPILOT’s features is to fully stop when the car in front stops, and Nissan notes that the brakes remain engaged when this occurs even if the driver doesn’t have their foot on the brake pedal. To resume driving requires direct driver input, either by lightly hitting the gas, or by touching the switch to engage self-driving again, even if the car in front begins driving again.
Unlike Tesla’s Autopilot can’t switch lanes, which Autopilot can do when a driver hits the turn signal in either direction and the system detects that it’s safe to do so. But perhaps more importantly, it sends warnings to the driver if their hands leave the wheel, and will actually shut down the autonomous driving and return full control if those go ignored for just a few seconds.
Nissan still has plans to gradually introduce more autonomy, but it’s staging the release of additional features. Lane switching in highway conditions is set to come to ProPILOT in 2018, and city driving, including full intersection negotiation, is supposed to make its debut in 2020.

What Nissan is offering here isn’t dramatically different from what’s been available in cruise-assist on newer model vehicles in the past, but it is a step forward, and an interesting middle-ground between those systems and Tesla’s Autopilot. Nissan says it has tested ProPILOT on Japanese and U.S. roadways, and the company says that in addition to a European debut aimed for 2017, there are roll-out plans with less defined dates for both U.S. and China.

1049,"AR helmet maker Skully investors boot founders, replacing them with Martin Fitcher as CEO",https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/12/ar-helmet-maker-skully-ceo-and-chief-of-staff-booted-out-by-investors/,2016/07/12,"
Anonymous sources have confirmed to TechCrunch that Skully co-founders Marcus and Mitch Weller have been kicked out of the company by investors. Marcus served as CEO of Skully while his brother Mitch served as chief of staff and provided business operations, product management, and material logistics support to the company.
Skully jumped into the tech scene two years ago after a highly successful Indiegogo campaign for the company’s augmented reality motorcycle helmet that lets riders see traffic behind them. The device also allows wearers to play music, receive directions and check weather information, hands-free.
The founders have been on a different page than investors regarding the future of the company for quite some time, according to a source close to the matter.
Both Marcus and Mitch are on the Skully board of directors along with Victor Westerlind from Intel Capital and Nicholas Brathwaite from Walden Riverwood Ventures.
Skully has sold thousands of its heads-up display helmets so far but has been troubled with shipping delays. One source we spoke to told us that Skully has only shipped 20 helmets so far, which conflicts with another source who said it was more than that but under 100.
Part of that may have been due to a manufacturer issue, which held up production and is a common scenario with hardware startups.
Reports are conflated regarding cash flow with some saying that the founders are running out of capital.
Rumors have also come to light that the company was simultaneously trying to sell itself and raise a Series B. 
One source told us that the last straw for Marcus appears to have been a botched acquisition by LeSports, a subsidiary of Chinese company LeEco – though another source said it was unclear who was responsible.
This source also told TechCrunch Skully talent has slowly been poached without direction from the management team. Tesla lured away the company’s head of engineering in May.
Marcus’ loyalty to his brother may have ultimately cost him the position. Marcus had been under investor pressure to remove Mitch but did not take action, according to a source.

1050,FiveAI picks up $2.7M to build AI-driven software for autonomous vehicles,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/12/fiveai/,2016/07/12,"
FiveAI is a rather ambitious U.K. startup that’s building AI-driven software to help accelerate the development of autonomous vehicles. The young company wants to apply the latest developments in computer vision and AI/machine learning to enable self-driving cars to do more of the heavy-lifting in regards to understanding and navigating their immediate environment.
To enable FiveAI to continue building out its autonomous vehicle software stack and grow its team of AI/machine learning and other software engineers, the startup has raised $2.7 million in funding. The round was led by Amadeus Capital Partners with participation from Spring Partners and Notion Capital.
Specifically, FiveAI wants to use AI/machine learning and computer vision to remove the need for highly detailed “prior 3D mapping” of environments, which I’m told is the predominant method used in autonomous vehicle navigation.
Instead, the startup’s software stack, coupled with an array of onboard sensors/cameras, aims to enable autonomous vehicles to safely and accurately navigate even complex urban environments with much simpler maps. Should it work properly, this approach would have a major advantage of negating the need to survey, maintain and share detailed 3D maps of the world’s roads.
Given the size of the task, however, it might be fair to conclude that $2.7 million won’t get FiveAI very far and is dwarfed by the amount of money Silicon Valley, such as Google and reportedly Apple, is pumping into autonomous vehicles.
That’s a point I put to Stan Boland, co-founder and CEO of FiveAI, who told me that the startup could have raised a larger round but wanted to balance the runway required to reach the first stage of development with the current valuation of the company.
The plan, he says, is to get to simulator and supervised road testing before raising a larger round. The startup will then begin working with vehicle OEMs to develop production-ready software.
On that note, Boland has a track record shipping huge software projects, albeit this is his first AI or auto-industry startup. He’s previously co-founded and was CEO of two European tech/comms success stories: Element 14 (acquired by Broadcom) and Icera (acquired by NVIDIA). And, for those of you who like me are old enough to know a little about the history of the British computer industry, he was also CEO of computer-maker Acorn.
Meanwhile, Boland is talking up the U.K. and FiveAI’s potential as an autonomous vehicle leader. He says the country has the software engineer talent and AI expertise required, not least because of the high standard of AI/machine learning teaching at leading universities, such as Oxford, Cambridge and Imperial. He also thinks the U.K. is well-positioned to develop a regulatory environment to help accelerate the development of self-driving cars.

1051,More EVs—and more kinds of EVs—are expected to be sold this year,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/12/more-evs-and-more-kinds-of-evs-are-expected-to-be-sold-this-year/,2016/07/12,"
If it seems like EVs are everywhere, you’re closer to being right this year than ever before. Navigant Research expects the EV market to grow 62% year over year in 2016, which adds up to nearly 200,000 EVs being sold this year.
Navigant points to long-range battery electric vehicles (BEVs) with price tags under $40,000, like the Chevy Bolt ($37,000 MSRP) that’s expected to hit dealerships in the fall, as being key to this growth. A press release also mentions the Tesla Model X, the latest Chevy Volt, the Prius Prime plug-in hybrid (PHEV), and the forthcoming Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV as driving the trend, pun definitely intended.
For the past five years or so, EVs have gotten a bit more of a market share on the West Coast. Navigant says the growth is going to come in the Northeast. Manufacturers are going to need to ramp up marketing to hit targets in several New England states, including Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Vermont, that have joined California in an effort to get more zero-emissions cars on the road by 2025.
It may be easier for consumers to find an EV that works for them as ranges get longer, prices drop, and more kinds of EVs become available. That’s getting a bit easier, according to the Department of Energy. In 2015, there were EVs available in 9 different classes, from two-seaters to standard-sized SUVs. More than half, 60%, of all the plug-in electric vehicles sold last year were midsize or large cars, like the Nissan Leaf and Tesla Model S.
Navigant and the DOE agree that the market for plug-in electric vehicles effectively began in 2011, when there was a whopping four models available. (Here’s a note for trivia night: The DOE does not list a Tesla as being available in 2011. The company had stopped taking orders for the Roadster and had not yet started production on the Model S at that point.) Now, there are 29, from the all-electric Fiat 500e to the Volvo XC90 Plug-in Hybrid.
Sales since 2011 have grown from about 20,000 to 120,000, which is a six-fold jump, but it still accounts for fewer than 1% of all vehicle sales in the US. Navigant’s predictions for 2016 could take EVs over that hurdle.

The Washington D.C. Fire and EMS Department is considering a plan to use Uber to transport low priority 911 callers, according to NBC Washington. It’s a horrible idea.
Washington’s plan is to hire a team of nurses who could evaluate a caller’s condition over the phone and direct them to an Uber if they are deemed stable. Already this is odd given that the purpose of an emergency responder is to evaluate the condition of a 911 caller.
“Someone who fell and broke his/her ankle could have potential underlying conditions,” said Alexia Haralambous, a DC area EMT. “A diabetic emergency, that had not yet fully presented itself, could have caused the event. Through a full EMT protocol, the responder would likely eventually check the glucose levels of the patient and determine that there is something larger.”
To account for potential deterioration in the condition of a transport, the Uber would need to be equipped with sirens, lights, and an extensive radio system for communication, added Haralambous.
A few weeks ago I needed to get some stitches out of my chin so I visited a local clinic. While I was there, I saw a man get an EKG after displaying signs of heart trouble. The man went to the clinic under the impression that he was suffering a routine ailment. Unfortunately, the diagnosis was severe. The doctors on-site recommended an immediate ambulance transport but the man decided to self-transport instead. This person was not only risking his own life but the lives of everyone on the road. Even with training, it’s unlikely that a ride-sharing driver would be able to ensure both patient and vehicle safety. Even if this patient was in the backseat, rapid deterioration could catch a driver off-guard and trigger an accident.
Such a partnership is not an extreme departure from previous car-sharing partnerships. Uber told TechCrunch that it already has healthcare partnerships in select cities in Florida and Georgia. Uber helps seniors and the chronically disabled in Atlanta get to doctors appointments, fitness classes and other similar services. In Gainesville, Florida, Uber partnered with local stakeholders to provide technology tutorials to seniors on how the service could be used to maintain mobility and freedom.
We reached out to Lyft, and the company reported similar goals to aid in the transportation of populations that struggle to maintain mobility:

Lyft’s mission is ensuring people who need rides the most are able to get them.  We are in ongoing discussions with public agencies and private businesses around the country about how we can work collaboratively to expand mobility options for those previously underserved by transportation options. We are proud to bring seniors – many of whom have regular medical appointments and limited transportation options – a reliable, safe, and affordable way to get around.


In all of these partnerships, the decision-making power rests with the rider. A rider can choose to ride whenever and wherever they would like. The problem with DC’s plan is that the health and safety of 911 callers would rest on the shoulders of a remote nurse who would be unable to visually assess the condition of a caller. This puts the patient in an unnecessarily dangerous situation simply because the city’s budget cannot keep up with 911 call volume.
That said, props to DC for contemplating an out of the box solution to a serious problem. We just don’t need to Uber everything. Maybe next time.

1053,Future Mobility aiming to sell electric cars worldwide by 2020,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/12/future-mobility-aiming-to-sell-electric-cars-worldwide-by-2020/,2016/07/12,"
Future Mobility is only four months old, but that isn’t stopping the auto startup from rolling out with its ambitious plans. Backed by Chinese Internet giant, Tencent, Future Mobility is aiming to sell premium electric cars by 2020 on a worldwide scale, as reported by the Wall Street Journal.
The startup has already poached 50 engineers from the likes of Google, Tesla, Mercedes-Benz and BMW and its chief executive, Carsten Breitfeld, says that the company will ramp up to nearly 600 engineers around the world within a year.
Breitfeld himself is a former project manager for BMW’s i8 plug-in sports car, so Future Mobility is in good hands. He told the Journal that Future Mobility wants to compete with BMW, Mercedes and Audi, especially in China’s luxury-car space. Whether the startup will work with an existing automaker or build its own plant remains to be seen, but in a short period of time we have seen bustling activity from Chinese Internet giants in the auto market.
Just last week, Alibaba unveiled its first smart car, which is already available for pre-order. And last month, Baidu, Tencent and JD.com each made a $50 million investment in Bitauto, which we’ve described as a combination of Cars.com, AutoTrader and Consumer Reports. Our email to Tencent to learn more about their EV plan wasn’t immediately returned.

1054,"Tesla under investigation for possible breach of securities law, WSJ reports",https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/11/tesla-under-investigation-for-possible-breach-of-securities-law-wsj-reports/,2016/07/11,"
Tesla is under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, The Wall Street Journal reported, for a possible securities law breach.
What’s at issue is whether the electric vehicle company should have notified shareholders immediately following a fatal accident on May 7 that killed a Tesla Model S owner who was using Autopilot at the time of the crash.
A spokesperson for Tesla said that the car company has not yet heard from the SEC regarding this matter.
As TechCrunch previously reported, multiple state and federal investigations are ongoing, and it is not yet clear if Tesla’s Autopilot features contributed to or caused the fatal accident in any way.
Laymen call Autopilot “self-driving” technology, and the company refers to this system as a “driver assistance system.” Numerous Tesla fan communities online share videos of drivers using Autopilot in a hands-free mode despite the company advising them against this.
Among agencies investigating the fatal Tesla Autopilot crash are the National Transportation Safety Board, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Florida Highway Patrol.
A non-fatal but also serious crash that followed on July 1 in Pennsylvania has contributed to heightened scrutiny of Tesla’s technology, shareholder dealings and stock performance.
The July crash involved a 2016 Model X SUV, and a driver who was also using Autopilot features. The driver was charged with careless driving by Pennsylvania State Police.
In the car company’s blog, Tesla defended itself against implications by Fortune magazine that it had misled its investors about risks associated with its business and, specifically, Autopilot technology.
Tesla did not disclose any information about the fatal accident to the public until June 30 with a blog post called “A Tragic Loss,” even though the crash took place in early May.
It remains to be seen whether the company has violated financial or other regulations in delaying discussion of that, or any other accidents involving their cars.
To-date, Tesla has not been sued for product liability. However, the family of Joshua Brown, the Tesla enthusiast killed in the Florida crash, has retained the services of a well-known personal injury law firm.

1055,Chevy cuts 4G LTE data price in half,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/11/chevy-cuts-4g-lte-data-price-in-half/,2016/07/11,"
In the past two years, more than 2 million Chevrolet cars with 4G LTE data connections have been sold, and, according to GM, those connections have chewed through 3 million gigabytes of data. Now each of those bytes will cost half as much, because Chevrolet is dropping the price of its data by 50 percent.
Where a 1 GB per month plan used to cost $20, now it’s $10. Annual plans are still $150, but now users get twice the data allowance: 20 GB rather than 10 GB. The company has also halved the price on its 10 GB/month plan to $40 and added a new 4 GB/month plan for $20.
Interestingly, Chevy notes in a press release that most of this data is being used in Silverado trucks, which is likely because these pickups are used as mobile offices for businesses. Runner-up in the data race is the family friendly beast of an SUV, the Suburban, which can connect up to seven devices via its Wi-Fi hotspot.
Not long after Chevy rolled out 4G LTE connectivity across its model line beginning in June 2014, it began making Apple CarPlay and Android Auto available. You can also add your Chevy to your AT&T Mobile Share Value Plan as if it were a giant rolling smartphone (which it kind of is, most days) or keep your car account separate. You do have to have the basic OnStar package in order to add data.
It’s probably worth noting, too, that while this makes Chevys “connected cars,” it’s not quite V2X (vehicle-to-whatever) technology. Chevys don’t communicate with each other automatically (V2V) or with the infrastructure (V2I) to predict, say, when a light is going to turn red. But GM CEO Mary Barra has said V2V capabilities will be coming to GM vehicles in 2017 with Super Cruise, so stay tuned.

1056,Yoshi launches “set it and forget it” vehicle re-fueling service in San Francisco,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/11/yoshi-launches-set-it-and-forget-it-vehicle-re-fueling-service-in-san-francisco/,2016/07/11,"
A startup called Yoshi Inc. is the latest to give drivers a way to fuel up without going to the gas station.
The company has officially launched its gas delivery service in the San Francisco Bay Area, and is offering other simple services like filling up the air in a car’s tires, replacing windshield wiper blades and washing cars, as well.
Sound familiar? Yoshi is not the only company to attempt to reach drivers where they park with a mobile app for booking.
Gas-delivering competitors in the U.S. include: Filld, WeFuel, Purple, Booster Fuels and GasNinjas. There also are international upstarts playing in the space, like FueledUp in Lagos, Nigeria.
Rather than delivering “on-demand,” Yoshi users schedule refueling one time, typically at a place of work where they park for hours during the day without needing their vehicle.
Then, they authorize the startup to sense when their vehicle is nearby and come gas it up as needed.
This “set it and forget it” approach allows Yoshi to optimize their delivery routes, explains CEO and co-founder Nick Alexander.

The company has engineered its own gas delivery trucks with a proprietary system, called the Fuel Vault, which allows Yoshi to access any car’s tank, even if the gas flap is locked.
With questions lingering about the safety and legality of fuel delivery direct to vehicles, Alexander said Yoshi is approaching relevant local regulators, and especially fire departments, in each market where it begins fuel delivery.
“There are a lot of rules to follow, but they’re not as fragmented state by state as you would think,” the CEO said.
The company is already profitable, with business beyond the San Francisco Bay Area, in Nashville, Tennessee and Atlanta, Georgia.
Yoshi has raised $120,000 in seed funding and is currently participating in Y Combinator in Silicon Valley. The CEO declined to comment on further fundraising activity.
Generally, Yoshi costs drivers $15 per month for a subscription, plus the cost of regular or premium gas, or other supplies like new windshield wiper blades. Yoshi also has a partnership with Firestone, which allows customers to buy new tires and book a tire change through Yoshi.
The company also works to fuel fleets, and establishes prices ad hoc with its clients.
In addition to using its seed funding to roll out to new markets, Yoshi plans to develop technology to keep pace with vehicle technology; for example, to deliver a rapid charge to electric vehicles, or hydrogen or biodiesel, Alexander said.
Today, the company’s fuel-delivery drivers are 1099 contractors, but the company is exploring other options, like hiring delivery drivers as W2 part-time staff or full-time employees in different markets.

1057,Lyft and GM expand Express Drive driver rental program,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/11/lyft-and-gm-expand-express-drive-driver-rental-program/,2016/07/11,"
No wheels used to mean no way to be a driver for a car-sharing service, but GM and Lyft’s Express Drive is one way around that limitation. The program sees GM offer all-in vehicle rentals to Lyft on a sliding fee scale depending on usage. Now, it’s expanding to California and Colorado, beginning in SF, LA and Denver.
GM and Lyft teamed up on Express Drive following a strategic investment by GM in Lyft to the tune of $500 million, and the program kicked off in March this year. GM noted in a press release about the expansion that it’s already off to a good start – 30 percent of new Lyft driver applicants actually request an Express Drive vehicle in their sign-up, and it has already driven almost $2 million in earnings for participating drivers to date.
GM says their Boston-based launch maxed out its available seats for drivers in under four days, suggesting there’s been strong demand wherever the partnership opens shop. Stats from Lyft shared via GM indicate that more than 130,000 people who have applied to be drivers in SF, LA and Denver, did not have cars that qualified. Lyft requires that cars be no older than a 2004 model year, and younger in many U.S.cities.
The all-electric 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV is included in the selection of available cars to Express Drive participants.
Express Drive opens up car-sharing on the driver side not only to people with cars that don’t qualify, but also to people who don’t own cars at all. The model is elegant in that it removes the burden of car ownership from both sides of the equation, which is smart for both Lyft and GM. Car rental services are the biggest purchasers of cars and trucks in the U.S., and car sharing services are likely to replace them eventually in that capacity.
Uber has a similar partnership in place with Enterprise, but the GM/Lyft arrangement cuts out the go-between. It’s also only one part of the Lyft/GM working relationship; the two have already announced plans to work together towards an autonomous driving future, and of course having a fleet supply arrangement already in place makes the transition to driverless Lyfts even easier.

What could the billionaire be referring to? Well, upon making the tweet, one of his 4.39 million Twitter followers responded by saying, “I already put in my 2 cents on Tesla 2.0,” sharing a LinkedIn article about a Tesla/SolarCity merger. Musk responded with, “Something like that.”
A few hours earlier, he weighed in on another user’s post about bringing Tesla and SolarCity together. Remember, it has only been three weeks since Musk’s Tesla made a $2.8 billion offer to acquire his SolarCity solar panel installation company.
Back in August 2006, Musk rolled out with part 1 of his Top Secret Tesla Masterplan, vowing to build a sports car, “use that money to build an affordable car,” “use that money to build an even more affordable car,” and “while doing above, also provide zero emission electric power generation options.”
Nearly ten years later and Tesla has accomplished Step 1 and is still preparing to roll out its sub-$30,000 (after tax credit) Model 3 sedan by late next year. The automaker is also working diligently to open the doors of a sprawling battery factory in Reno, Nevada, using the batteries to help power its electric vehicles and also making them available to homeowners as a power source.

1059,Google’s Self-Driving Car Project has a new legal lead,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/08/googles-self-driving-car-project-has-a-new-legal-lead/,2016/07/08,"
Google’s Self-Driving Car Project is one step closer to becoming its own independent business. Recode has confirmed that the autonomous-driving company under the Alphabet umbrella has hired The Climate Corporation’s chief legal officer, Kevin Vosen, as its first general attorney. He’s slated to begin later this month.
Currently, Google’s self-driving unit is under the company’s experimental lab, X, but Vosen’s hire seemingly marks another gradual step in it becoming its own entity. And the timing is interesting, considering it comes amidst Tesla being federally investigated for a fatal May 7 crash involving a Model S in Autopilot mode.
The legal red tape that Google — or any company developing autonomous driving technology — will encounter with regulators will make having a veteran lawyer like Vosen handy, given his experience. Vosen handled The Climate Corporation’s Compliance and Government Relations activities. Also, Climate’s CEO and co-founder, David Friedberg, formerly worked for Google under its Corporate Development and Product Management, so there’s a connection there. Friedberg is also the chairman of Metromile, which offers pay-per-mile auto insurance, so perhaps there’s something greater in the works here, as well.
The news of Google’s autonomous unit lawyering up comes shortly after Google X hired Tim Papandreou, the former head of the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency’s Office of Innovation, so its self-driving development team is getting more and more robust.

1060,New reports confirm $1.15B leveraged loan raised by Uber at 5%,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/07/new-reports-confirm-1-15b-leveraged-loan-raised-by-uber-at-5/,2016/07/07,"
Two weeks ago, we reported that Uber was in talks to raise $1-2 billion in leveraged loans. The Wall Street Journal is circulating new information that the company has closed a $1.15 billion leveraged loan, with a 5 percent yield.
This number comes in on the low side of our previous estimates. Last month, sources confirmed to TechCrunch that Uber had plans to raise $1-2 billion in leveraged loans.
Uber initially targeted a 4-4.5 percent yield but ended up settling on 5 percent. In the last month, the company has brought in $4.65 billion in capital from debt and equity investments. A $3.5 billion equity round from the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund preceded today’s leveraged loan led by Morgan Stanley. The loan also contained money from Barclays PLC, Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc according to the Wall Street Journal source.
All the capital originates from multinational institutions. This hints that CEO Travis Kalanick plans to add the money to his growing war-chest to fight Chinese ride-sharing rival Didi Chuxing.
Uber likely opted for the leveraged loan to avoid further dilution. The company has little in collateral to comfort bankers issuing debt. For reference, Apple, a publicly traded mature tech company, has previously issued bonds at a 3.22 percent blended interest rate excluding floating rate debt.
One more perk for Uber, private debt, like this leveraged loan, does not have to be publicly disclosed.
We have reached out to Uber for comment and will update with information if it becomes available.

1061,Carmaker + ridesharing roundup,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/07/carmaker-ride-sharing-roundup/,2016/07/07,"
Auto manufacturers are realizing that the future of transportation is not going to be one person, one car. It’s going to be ridesharing, ridehailing and public transit — and these vehicles may not even require drivers. So most major manufacturers have made a turn toward becoming “mobility companies.”
It’s been a quick turn, though. In just the first half of 2016, several manufacturers have negotiated that turn by partnering with a transportation company that’s already operating in this brave new transportation world, or by creating their own in-house mobility service, as BMW and Daimler did.
As the transportation landscape changes in the next several years, these partnerships will likely become a web of options, including biking and walking, that are accessed by apps to coordinate local travel. But for now, here are the biggest collaborations on the streets:


BMW + ReachNow: The German automaker began ReachNow as a pilot program in the San Francisco area under its DriveNow brand. In late 2015, the team wound down operations in California and moved to Seattle, where it restarted as ReachNow in April 2016. This is a free-floating carsharing service; you can pick up a car, drive it and drop it off in any valid parking space. BMW has also invested in Scoop, a carpooling company based in California.

Daimler + car2go: This is the outlier on the list, since Daimler created its car2go service in the dark ages of carsharing — 2008. It uses Smart ForTwo models exclusively, including electric versions in some cities. It’s now the largest such service, in 29 cities globally and with more than 1.9 million users.

GM + Lyft: As of January, GM and Lyft are working together to create a network of on-demand autonomous vehicles in the future. In the meantime, they’ve partnered with Express Drive, a short-term rental service for Lyft drivers who need qualified cars. If Lyft drivers give 65 or more rides using their rented Chevy Equinox in pilot city Chicago, the $99-per-week rental fee is waived.

Toyota + Uber: Toyota and Uber announced their partnership in May of this year, allowing Uber drivers to make lease payments using Uber income. Interestingly, Mirai Creation Investment is also named in the deal, which hints at Uber drivers being able to lease hydrogen-powered Mirai vehicles in states like California that have some infrastructure to support them.

VW + Gett: In May 2016, Volkswagen invested $300 million in Gett, formerly GetTaxi, a ridehailing service operating in 60 cities worldwide. Gett is a bit different from competitors like Uber in that it uses only drivers who have a permit to carry passengers; for example, half of the taxis in London use Gett, according to a press release.

Edited 7/8/16; car2go now has 1.9 million users, not 1.3 million.

Yes, Millennials Do Buy Cars




Not a week goes by, it seems, without some sort of development in the world regarding self-driving cars. Whether it’s Google going on a hiring spree as it attempts to accelerate its efforts or General Motors acquiring Cruise, a driverless-car startup, the subject consistently finds a place in any given news cycle.
And now Uber recently got in the mix, putting autonomous cars on the streets of Pittsburgh.
But if you‘re waiting for a self-driving car revolution, you better keep waiting. Sure, the technology is there, but there are plenty of legal and regulatory battles that will have to take place before consumers are being zipped around in autonomous cars.
What’s more interesting, and less talked about, is what a world of automated drivers will look like for some of the world’s most disruptive transportation companies — Uber and Lyft — and how these ridesharing companies will become part of a one-sided, commodity marketplace model with complex logistics and low profit margins.
Lyft and Uber won the war over driver supply. And I should know; one of the companies that did not win on supply against them is Taxi Magic, a company I founded.
The phenomenal success of Lyft and Uber stems from the fact that they are two-sided marketplaces. Both have incredible network effects — more drivers attract more riders, which in turn attracts even more drivers. And this virtuous circle makes the economics of these two companies very different from others in the on-demand ground travel space.
But once fully self-driving cars are available for widespread use, one side of that marketplace will collapse. Drivers will be replaced with capital, and anyone with sufficient capital will be able to put a fleet of cars on the road. Car manufacturers, city governments, perhaps Google and Tesla and others will enter the game, massively increasing the supply of cars and flooding the market.
Self-driving cars are exciting. But they also are a long way off.
With the advent of fully self-driving cars, it’s easy to imagine rideshare companies looking more and more like the airline industry. And while some of us have brand loyalty (mostly because of mileage programs), the industry as a whole is fully commoditized and there is little difference between United and American. Airlines all do the same thing (move consumers from Point A to Point B), and primarily compete on pricing in a race to the bottom.
If this analysis is right, the industry of on-demand self-driving fleets will need apps that connect them to consumers, similar to KAYAK for airlines. This app could be Uber or Lyft, or both, but neither — as one-sided software layer connecting passengers to self-driving fleets — would be worth what they are worth now.
KAYAK is a very successful company used by millions to find air travel services, yet when Priceline bought KAYAK for $1.8 billion in 2012, KAYAK was performing 1.2 billion searches. That purchase price seems low given the quantity of searches, but it was an accurate reflection of the business’ value. KAYAK is a one-sided marketplace generating revenue through lead gen to service providers (airlines and hotels). That type of one-sided marketplace is far less valuable than a two-sided marketplace that has a locked-up supply and also manages demand.

Liability in the coming age of autonomous autos
The driverless truck is coming, and it's going to automate millions of jobs

For technology geeks like me, self-driving cars are exciting — they will make commuting safer and our daily lives easier. But they also are a long way off, and before we get to use them, there is a lot more technology to create and, beyond that, policy and legal challenges to overcome. When they come into mass use, they are likely to be awesome, creating a new platform for future startups or alternative business models for existing businesses.
One thing self-driving cars won’t do, however, is help Lyft and Uber (and other two-sided on-demand ground travel companies) maintain their existing business models or the valuations they command. While self-driving cars can help these companies create new platforms, it is hard to see how they can help them increase their value or justify valuations that these companies and their current business models now command.
As the age of the horse and buggy ended, jockeys faced a rough patch, but the age of the auto mechanic was on the horizon. This time around, we’re going to see the end of driving as an occupation. And no one stands to lose more than ridesharing companies.

There was a laptop found in the Tesla Model S involved in the deadly May 7 crash using Autopilot, Florida investigators confirmed with CNBC on Thursday. Florida Highway Patrol Sgt. Kim Montes told the news outlet that a laptop and DVD player were recovered amongst the crash wreckage, but that they couldn’t determine whether Joshua Brown was using either device at the time of the fatal accident, which occurred when the vehicle collided with a truck.
Montes did confirm, however, that Brown’s Model S had a computer stand, but that the laptop wasn’t mounted on it, when investigators found the computer at the scene of the crash. Compounding the investigation further is that witnesses of the crash are offering contrasting accounts about whether the DVD player in the sedan was playing a movie.
This slight update comes exactly a week after federal regulators launched an investigation into the Model S crash. On Wednesday, Tesla maintained that drivers using autopilot remain safer than regular drivers.

1064,DeNA brings EasyMile’s self-driving bus to Japan,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/07/self-driving-bus-japan/,2016/07/07,"
Maybe it’s just FOMO, but it seems like every internet company wants to be in the car business these days, and Japan’s DeNA is no exception. The app maker’s automotive wing had a special event in Tokyo today (via Reuters) to reveal its first self-driving vehicle, a 12-person bus which will begin operating in Japan’s Chiba prefecture at a shopping center next month.
DeNA is probably a familiar name for TechCrunch readers, but the company’s highlight moment to date might be its selection as Nintendo’s partner in bringing its iconic gaming characters and brands to mobile devices. DeNA has had an automotive business for a while now, though, and now it’s launching its first production vehicle in partnership with French driverless tech company EasyMile, which makes the EZ10 Robot Shuttle currently being trialled in a number of global projects.

The EasyMile EZ10 can hit a max of 40km or around 25 miles per hour, and employs a variety of sensors, cameras, GP and other systems in order to operate. It’s not a full-featured city dweller, though; EasyMile’s vehicles are designed specifically for use in private environments, where they don’t have to contend with the added complexity of human traffic.
DeNA’s role in all of this is primarily to handle coordinating with local Japanese authorities to make sure the French company’s hardware can operate in tandem with local regulations and existing systems, as well as facilitating insurance and offering “services” to customers who purchase the self-driving vehicles for deployment.
Like Alibaba and LG, DeNA is teaming up with a more experienced automotive industry player rather than trying to build something from scratch, which is smart given the industry’s complexity and how much it would cost in terms of time and money to ramp up an internal car business.
That said, this is a potentially high-stakes game of musical chairs; partnerships require lower investment than spinning up your own business, and are easier to switch if you bet wrong, but there are still going to be big rewards for companies who pick the correct unions early. We’ll see if DeNA and Easymile’s pays off.

Over the coming months, we are going to be seeing a lot more pink mustaches on Audi, BMW, and Mercedes vehicles.
Today, Lyft is launching Lyft Premier. Users will be able to catch rides in luxury sedans and SUVs.
Highly rated drivers with access to high-end vehicles can service rides. The cost premium for Premier rides will earn drivers additional money. Lyft will also be able to take advantage of far higher margins on the new rides.
Lyft drivers are encouraged but not required to offer things like water bottles, phone chargers, and gum to riders to improve the customer experience. Lyft isn’t offering any additional services with Lyft Premier beyond the additional leg room and leather seats of the premium vehicles.
Lyft has been aggressively partnering with companies like Apple to transport employees. The company has been adding in features like seamless expensing for enterprise users. Premier falls in line nicely with what appears to be a growing strategy targeting corporate travel.
Lyft’s largest competitor, Uber, already offers luxury car service. Uber users have complained about longer wait times using UberSELECT and UberBLACK relative to traditional Pool and UberX service. Higher prices for luxury services generally result in fewer riders and drivers. This can make it more difficult to hail down a BMW on the outskirts of a city. Lyft wants to counteract this with scheduled rides. Lyft launched scheduled rides earlier this year to enable users to schedule a timely pickup 24 hours in advance.
Ironically, Uber was founded as a luxury black car-hailing service. The two companies have been swapping punches for years. In the last month Uber has launched a rewards program with Capital One, upfront fares, and ad-free Pandora. Uber has also been steadily increasing its investment in UberEATS for food delivery.
“We were first on scheduled rides, first to request rides on behalf of a third party, first to integrate tipping, and first and only to offer same-day pay for drivers,” said David Baga, Chief Business Officer for Lyft.
Premier will cost a 2X premium over traditional service and rides will be available in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York City.

1066,A Tesla Model S with Lidar spotted on the road around Palo Alto,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/07/a-tesla-model-s-with-lidar-spotted-on-the-road-around-palo-alto/,2016/07/07,"
Tesla may be taking a page from Google’s Self-Driving Car Project’s book. A Model S was spotted near the company’s Palo Alto headquarters, strapped with Lidar sensors, as reported by Elektrek. Ironically, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has strongly dismissed Lidar in the past, relegating it to a technology that the company doesn’t need to achieve fully autonomous cars. Hmm…maybe he has changed his mind?
A Tesla owner took to a blog post to describe the sight of spotting a Model S with Lidar sensors on the road and we can’t say that any of his observances and opinions sound far-fetched at all.
“Today I saw the first car that I strongly suspect is a Tesla self-driving test vehicle,” the Tesla owner wrote, accompanying his post with a picture. “The Tesla self-driving test vehicle is disguised as cleverly as possible.  A giant Stanford logo on the rear windshield and a Stanford license plate frame with a paper plate.  Clearly, Tesla is trying to convince locals that this is part of a Stanford research project.   Although Stanford is a very wealthy university, I doubt they would be using a brand new Model S for experimental purposes.  My suspicions were confirmed that this was a Tesla corporate vehicle when I saw it enter the back parking lot of Tesla headquarters!”
As of March, California Department of Motor Vehicles’ data cited Google with 73 cars and 230 permitted human drivers for self-driving vehicle testing in the state and that completely trumps its closest competition, Tesla, which had eight registered vehicles and five drivers at the time. But stemming from this blog post, if you see a self-driving vehicle with Lidar being tested around Palo Alto these days, it may not be a foregone conclusion that it’s a Google vehicle. It may be a Tesla.
It will be interesting to see if Musk addresses this as much as he has been responding to the criticism and scrutiny over the company’s Autopilot-related Model S death lately.

1067,Canadian self-driving program further slowed by Tesla Autopilot fatality,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/07/canadian-self-driving-program-further-slowed-by-tesla-autopilot-fatality/,2016/07/07,"
The driver death resulting from a Tesla Model S Autopilot crash on May 7 has ramifications that extend well past a federal investigation in the United States.
In fact, government officials from the Canadian province of Ontario told Reuters that the fatal accident has further scrutinized its own autonomous driving technology and that it may have set back the development of its overall self-driving program as a result. Wow.
In comparison to the U.S., Ontario has had some of the most progressive laws on the books for self-driving testing, but has suffered through a lack of applications — and Tesla’s Autopilot fatality certainly won’t help its cause, as the scope of scrutiny on autonomous technology has only gotten wider since the accident.
A spokesperson from Ontario’s Ministry of Transportation told Reuters that its self-driving car program has a 10-year blueprint and has received interest, citing nearly 100 companies and organizations that have already been working on autonomous technology in Ontario as of last year. However, the lack of applications since testing of self-driving cars in Ontario launched this past January coupled with companies opting to test autonomous vehicles in the U.S., spells a rather bleak outlook for the Canadian program.
Google and Honda will not be participating in Ontario’s program and we didn’t immediately get an answer when we posed the same question to George Saratlic, General Motors’ Lead Manager of Product, Brand & Technology Communications in Canada.
Let’s see if Tesla vowing that drivers operating in Autopilot mode remain safer than regular drivers has any positive effects on other companies developing self-driving technology in the U.S., Canada or anywhere else.

1068,"Didi Chuxing adds new safety features, including a passenger SOS button",https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/07/didi-chuxing-adds-new-safety-features-including-a-passenger-sos-button/,2016/07/07,"
Didi Chuxing, the taxi booking app that is beating Uber in China, has added a number of safety features to its service including an SOS button for its 300 million registered users.
The company, which was formed by a merger between China’s top two taxi apps last year and recently closed a $7.3 billion funding round, announced today that it has implemented changes to “enhance user safety and protection” of passengers across the 400 cities that it serves in China.
Most notable is perhaps the SOS button, which, with one click, sends an alert to contacts that are reset by the passenger. Didi said also that, in the event that the button is activated, it has “trained Didi SOS Taskforce members” who can check in on the passenger in real-time, since their device automatically begins recording audio once they request help.
Uber added a similar panic button last year, initially in India following a passenger rape, in a rollout that also include real-time passenger location tracking. That’s another feature that Didi initiated today. Initially launched in beta in May, now all Didi passengers can share their location, estimated time of arrival, the vehicle license number and other information to friends via both the Didi app and popular chat services WeChat and QQ. Didi said that overseas users — who make use of its integration with Lyft in the U.S. and soon other allies in Asia — can access the feature while outside of China.

Didi also introduced its number masking feature across the whole of China, to help passengers retain their privacy while communicating with drivers, and it is rolling out “biometric driver authentication” to verify its drivers. That latter feature is similar to another that Uber uses currently, too. Uber China, the U.S. firm’s dedicated company in the country, introduced ‘selfie authentication’ to cut down on driver fraud back in April of this year.
Finally, also related to fraud and driver management, Didi announced a tie-in with local and national law agencies around background checks and driver screening. The company already conducts these checks but it (boldly) proclaimed that it is “the only ride-hailing platform in the industry to cooperate with relevant state departments in [China].” Take that Uber! Considering that many of these new features are already visible in Uber, we guess Didi needed to puff its chest out about something for this press announcement.
But, on a serious note, more safety features are only a good thing as taxi-on-demand and ride-sharing services continue to grow in popularity among consumers in China, the U.S. and the rest of the world.

1069,Tesla says drivers using Autopilot remain safer than regular drivers,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/06/tesla-says-drivers-using-autopilot-remain-safer-than-regular-drivers/,2016/07/06,"
Tesla has reiterated that drivers using Autopilot mode remain safer than those who don’t. The new disclosure came as the automaker continues to deny reports from Fortune that it misled investors and the public by taking too long to reveal details of a fatal accident involving one of its customers who was in Autopilot.
The carmaker refuted claims that it acted improperly by not revealing details of the crash until an investigation was made public, and today — in response to what it described as Fortune’s “fundamentally incorrect” reporting — it said that autopilot mode remains safer than regular drivers.
In a long press statement, Tesla argued that one accident doesn’t make auto pilot unsafe:

That Tesla Autopilot had been safely used in over 100 million miles of driving by tens of thousands of customers worldwide, with zero confirmed fatalities and a wealth of internal data demonstrating safer, more predictable vehicle control performance when the system is properly used.
That contrasted against worldwide accident data, customers using Autopilot are statistically safer than those not using it at all.
That given its nature as a driver assistance system, a collision on Autopilot was a statistical inevitability, though by this point, not one that would alter the conclusion already borne out over millions of miles that the system provided a net safety benefit to society.

Tesla paid tribute to Brown in a statement last month. While it didn’t name him directly, the firm said it was “beyond saddened by their loss” of “a friend to Tesla and the broader EV community.”
“We would like to extend our deepest sympathies to his family and friends,” it added.
The company has taken significant criticism for its handling of the tragic accident, and this new statement on the matter is sure to divide people with its strong stance that, statistically, Autopilot mode can’t prevent all road fatalities.
Tesla went into detail rebutting Fortune’s two articles, claiming that the publication “jumped the gun” on its story and did not wait 24 hours as requested for Tesla to provide its full side of the story.
Fortune, meanwhile, is standing by its reporting. The publication reiterated that it contacted Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk for comment and clarification before running its stories.

1070,Tesla’s reported Autopilot 2.0 will face new goalposts for ‘smart’,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/06/tesla-autopilot-2-0-rumor/,2016/07/06,"
Two separate reports claim Autopilot 2.0, an enhanced version of Tesla’s Autopilot semi-autonomous driving tech, is coming to vehicles soon, potentially as part of the upcoming 8.0 update of Tesla’s software. TechnoBuffalo reported that Autopilot 2.0 is confirmed as “coming soon,” while Electrek’s Fred Lambert discussed the feature in an earlier piece focused on the overall 8.0 version update for Tesla vehicles.
What would Autopilot 2.0 bring to the table? According to the TechnoBuffalo report, it would use the new dual-camera hardware that has been spotted in some prototype Model S and Model X units roving the streets. Thanks to those cameras, the Autopilot 2.0 system has a couple of new abilities, according to the site’s anonymous source, including a way to automatically detect and stop in response to stop signs and red traffic lights.
Electrek says that the new Autopilot 2.0 features, which include more than just the ones reported by TechnoBuffalo, will rely heavily on the new sensor suite, so it’s unlikely that a lot of the advances will be backward compatible.
Any forthcoming Autopilot updates released by Tesla will be met with new levels of scrutiny, both in terms of public perception and likely regulatory attention, too. These new features definitely sound like net wins in terms of advancing progress toward a safer autonomous vehicle, but everything has changed now that we’ve seen two recent accidents involving Autopilot, one of which resulted in a fatality and one reported just today involving a Model X.
In many ways, we’ve been warned: Players like Google and Ford have made no secret about preferring so-called L4 tech (full autonomy) versus a more graduated approach like the one Tesla has implemented with Autopilot.
At the very least, it seems likely that Tesla will rethink how it presents driver-assist technologies like Autopilot, and it could also make some technical tweaks along the lines of what Tesla owner and industry observer Marco Arment suggests in his recent blog post on the subject. As for Autopilot 2.0, it’s hard to imagine the company proceeding with a rollout of any successor to its autonomous tech in the midst of everything else that’s happening, even if on paper the benefits of the new features would improve safety overall.
We reached out to Tesla for comment on any forthcoming updates to Autopilot but did not receive a response in time for publication.

1071,Another crashed Tesla was allegedly in Autopilot mode,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/06/another-tesla-crashes-in-autopilot-mode/,2016/07/06,"
Tesla’s Autopilot feature might be a bigger problem than the company realizes. A Detroit art gallery owner informed police that he had his 2016 Tesla Model X in Autopilot mode when it crashed and rolled over on the Pennsylvania Turnpike last Friday, as reported by the Detroit Free Press on Wednesday morning.
Although the Model X driver, Albert Scaglione, and his son-in-law, Tim Yanke, both survived Friday’s crash, which occurred just over 100 miles east of Pittsburgh, the scope of scrutiny on Tesla’s Autopilot mode is likely to only grow. Thus far, Tesla released a statement to Electrek, saying that it currently has “no data to suggest that Autopilot was engaged at the time of the incident” and that “until the customer responds, we are unable to further investigate.”
According to the Free Press, a Pennsylvania State Police report from Friday’s scene noted that the Model X hit a guard rail “off the right side of the roadway” and “it then crossed over the eastbound lanes and hit the concrete median,” tumbling onto its roof in the middle eastbound lane. Scaglione reportedly told police that his Model X was in Autopilot at the time of the accident.
Last Friday’s Autopilot-related accident came just a day after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched an investigation into the fatal May 7 crash in Florida, in which Tesla Model S owner Joshua D. Brown had the same feature activated. On Tuesday, Tesla claimed to have informed federal regulators about the May 7 crash nine days after it occurred .
Just like the NHTSA will have to thoroughly investigate the Autopilot-related fatality in Florida, Pennsylvania State Police will have to dig deeper to confirm whether the Model X’s Autopilot feature suffered a malfunction. The reporting officer at the scene, Dale Vukovich, told the Free Press that he will likely cite Scaglione for the accident, which also involved another car, but didn’t specify the charge.
Before learning about the Model X crash, Musk offered his condolences over Brown’s death, before retweeting this:


1.3 million people die a year in car accidents. Yet, 1 person dies in a Tesla on autopilot and people decry driverless cars as unsafe.

1072,Volkswagen throws in with LG on ‘Cross-Over’ connected car platform,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/06/volkswagen-lg-connected-car-platform/,2016/07/06,"
Everyone’s picking teams for the coming connected car wars, and Volkswagen and LG have chosen each other. The new smart car squad announced a “memorandum of understanding” to collaborate on R&D related to a connected car platform to be developed “over the coming years” today.
So what, exactly, does this partnership entail? It’s not just the premise for a terrible buddy cop comedy; instead, here are the three goals that LG and VW hope to achieve by teaming up:


Developing technologies that bring together the connected car and the smart home so that drivers are able to control and monitor smart devices in their homes — such as lights, security systems and domestic appliances — from out on the road.


Developing a context-sensitive notification centre that can deliver messages in an intuitive and safe manner and provide optimised recommendations to the driver in real time.


Developing next-generation infotainment technology for connected cars.


The BUDD-e concept at CES was a preview of some of VW’s work with LG.
LG has a head-start on the connected how piece, since they already make a host of connected appliances including smart washers, dryers and refrigerators. LG also makes smartphones, which you may or not have noticed, given the lacklustre sales of their latest modular G5 Android-powered smartphone.
One other key tidbit in the plan outline above: None of the bullet points talk about automation or making the car itself more intelligent as it pertains to the task of actually driving. But the goal of adding intelligence to the ecosystem that surrounds the car, and plugging it into infotainment as well as the smart home, has advantages in terms of being more achievable in the near-term; LG and Volkswagen already demonstrated some prototypes of this kind of tech in action at CES this year, as you can see below.

1073,Self-driving delivery robots could soon be common sights in European cities,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/06/self-driving-delivery-bots-europe/,2016/07/06,"
Airborne drone delivery is still more PR than public reality, but wheeled, self-driving delivery bots could be trundling down a sidewalk near you sooner than you think. London-based Starship Technologies, which counts Skype co-founders Ahti Heinla and Janus Friis among its founding team, is launching a broad testing phase of its autonomous delivery bots in parts of the UK, Germany and Switzerland starting this month.
Starship’s relatively small wheeled delivery bots have been in testing in select cities in 12 countries during the last nine months already, but this expansion of the trial will mark the first time the robots are being tested in actual delivery scenarios. That means they’re bringing on partners to provide the delivery inventory, including food delivery players Just Eat, and London-based Pronto.co.uk. German retailer Metro Group and parcel delivery company Hermes will also take part in the pilot, which will span five cities providing deliveries to actual paying customers.
London, Düsseldorf, and Bern can expect to see the robots in action first, with other cities in Europe and America to follow as the trial progresses. Starship Technologies’ Marketing and Communications Manager Henry Harris-Burland tells TechCrunch that this phase of testing should span between six and eight months, with a full commercial deployment currently targeting 2017, pending progress of the trials.
As for the goal of the tests, Harris-Burland says they are many and varied, including “public acceptance, testing the reliability of the technology, testing human reactions, and testing transportation of hot food, cold food, parcels and groceries.”
I asked Harris-Burland whether the robots might prove a target of abuse (there’s precedent), or cause for anxiety in unprepared human observers.
“Abuse is rare and in over 5,000 miles of testing, we haven’t had an issue of abuse yet,” he explained via email. “However with more and more robots out on the streets, it is a matter of time before something happens and we’re ready for this. It is another reason why we’re testing the robots in real world environments. The robot obviously has 9 cameras, tracking to the nearest inch and alarms to prevent any sort of incident. The robot has come into contact with 400,000 people and there hasn’t been an incident yet.”
As to how Starship Technologies plans to educate the average person about what this space-age robot is doing in its city and for what reason, Harris-Burland explained that they’ll be socialized during testing with human companions.
“The robots are accompanied by humans in the initial pilot phase of our joint testing program,” he added. “This is for a variety of reasons, but also to monitor public acceptance and engagement. What will happen when a robot turns up at a customers door? How will they react? The human there will be able to answer some questions that the consumer may have. Also they will be told they’re part of the world’s first robotic delivery trials which is pretty cool!”



Starship Technologies has clearly given a lot of thought to the part of robot tech that too often gets ignored: how to integrate its use into human society. Hopefully that means these bots will continue to make their deliveries efficiently and effectively without fear of unwanted human intervention.

1074,Alibaba unveils its first smart car — and it’s available for pre-order now,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/06/alibaba-unveils-its-first-smart-car-and-its-available-for-pre-order-now/,2016/07/06,"
Alibaba has officially announced its move into the automobile space after it unveiled its first “internet car” in collaboration with SAIC, one of China’s big four state-owned automakers.
The RX5 is available for pre-order now, it’s priced upwards of RMB 148,800 ($22,300) with deliveries scheduled to start in August. The sports vehicle has been developed over the last two years as part of a joint venture between Alibaba and SAIC, which put a combined $160 million into the 50-50 project. It includes a new version of Alibaba’s Yun operating system to enable the car to connect to and tap into various internet services.
Alibaba raised a few examples of what that could mean in practical terms. It ranges from personalized greetings, music and preferred destinations based on settings that can be configured from a smartphone or wearable, to the ability to use Alibaba’s Alipay payments service to pay for parking spaces, fill up with gas or buy a coffee. It’s logical that Alibaba’s own services are a core part of possibility functionality, but the company said it wants to open YunOS to third parties, too.
On the entertainment side of things, the RX5 includes three LED screens and space for up to four detachable 360 degree cameras to record video and take photos — because IN-CAR SELFIES — and a smart rear view mirror. As you might expect, there’s support for voice controls while an onboard “intelligent” mapping system, the companies claim, will work without GPS or WiFi.
There’s no crazy, next-level ‘smart’ car features like autopilot, instead Alibaba is putting the focus on a shipping a connected car.

“What we are creating is not ‘internet in the car’, but a ‘car on the internet’. This is a significant milestone in the automobile industry. Smart operating systems become the second engine of cars, while data is the new fuel,” said Dr. Wang Jian, who is chairman of Alibaba’s ‘Technology Steering Committee.’
“Going forward, cars will become an important platform for internet services and smart hardware innovation. We will be embracing a world where everything is closely connected,” Wang added.
Alibaba is far from the only Chinese internet firm to get into cars. LeEco, formerly LeTv, is backing ambitious U.S. project Faraday Future and building a car of its own, while Baidu is one the front runners testing self-driving vehicles in both China and the U.S..
Alibaba is also a major shareholder in Didi Chuxing, the company that is beating Uber in China which recently landed a $1 billion investment from Apple as part of a gargantuan $7 billion round. It is unclear whether Alibaba will use that relationship and work with Didi to provide smart cars.

1075,Drivers are warming up to autonomous cars. Mostly.,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/05/drivers-are-warming-up-to-autonomous-cars-mostly/,2016/07/05,"
The results of two new studies — one big, one really big — on what consumers want in autonomous cars have been released recently. The answer of both is, in a nutshell, we want to be able to let a car drive on its own when driving is monotonous or annoying, like during the daily commute. But we also definitely want to have the ability to take control of the car if something goes wrong. Or if we just want to drive the fun parts.
Volvo is a leader in the autonomous car race, with 100 autonomous-capable vehicles being deployed to customers in Sweden next year in its Drive Me program and ADAS of varying degrees of assistance in its vehicles currently for sale. It released the results of its “Future of Driving Consumer Survey,” which gathered responses from 50,000 people around the world. It turns out that 72 percent of drivers want to “preserve the art of driving,” according to the report. That would be the majority who still want to take on the twisty bits of road themselves.
Some early adopters are ready to let vehicles take over completely, as it seems happened in the recent fatal crash of a Tesla in autonomous mode. Tesla has made it clear that its autonomous driving mode is a beta system and that drivers must be ready to assume control — and responsibility — in the event of a crash. Volvo has taken the opposite tack, saying that if one of their vehicles is involved in a crash while in autonomous mode, liability rests with the company. This conviction is borne out by Volvo’s survey, where 79 percent of respondents expect the manufacturer to assume that liability.
It’s interesting to note that Volvo also found that in California, long the land of cars — and gridlock — drivers were less likely to want to drive the car themselves and more likely to see driving as a waste of time. On the other side of the country, more than 8 in 10 New Yorkers said they’d commute daily in an autonomous vehicle, which isn’t surprising in a city where the majority of households don’t even own a vehicle, preferring instead public transportation, taxis or ride-hailing services.
The other, smaller survey by AlixPartners, asked 1,517 people in June about driverless vehicles. Nearly three-quarters of respondents said they’d want a driverless car to do all the driving, and 90 percent said they’d let an autonomous vehicle do the daily commute driving if the human could take over sometimes. People seem to be able to imagine tricky emergency situations where an algorithm might not cut it; so far, they aren’t mistaken. This is the thought process that has led to other surveys to conclude that Americans aren’t ready for autonomous automobiles.

Today might be conspicuous in the annals of autonomous vehicles for a more serious reason, but another month is over and Google has issued its self-driving car report for June. In it are some interesting details about the system’s ability to detect and avoid cyclists.
“Cyclists are fast and agile — sometimes moving as quickly as cars — but that also means that it’s hard for others to anticipate their movements,” reads the report. “Our cars recognize cyclists as unique users of the road, and are taught to drive conservatively around them.”
The LIDAR and other sensors on the vehicles can detect bikers in any direction, or even every direction at once, as this illustration shows.

That’s somewhere over a hundred Googlers riding their bikes around a stationary self-driving car. This is what they do all day in Mountain View, apparently. Each bike was tracked individually and its likely path predicted, probably giving the car’s AI an anxiety attack.

When cyclists are detected, they’re given extra room, and the cars won’t attempt to pass if the bike is taking up the whole lane (rarely convenient for drivers, but often necessary, cyclists will surely agree).
Hand signals are also seen, understood and taken into account when predicting a cyclist’s path later on, after the signalling hand has returned to its grip.
Two fender-benders occurred in June, neither the Google car’s fault and neither causing more than scraped bumpers.

1078,"BMW, Mobileye and Intel are building a full self-driving car for 2021",https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/01/bmw-mobileye-and-intel-are-building-a-full-self-driving-car-for-2021/,2016/07/01,"
BMW is teaming up with Mobileye and Intel to work on its first fully autonomous self-driving car, which it plans to ship by 2021, confirming Bloomberg’s report.
Compared to existing self-driving technology, this new generation of cars is supposed to be able to drive themselves from start to finish. This isn’t just about helping you when you’re on the highway — it’s a door-to-door self-driving car platform. BMW and its partners want to replace the driver basically.
Everybody knows BMW and Intel, but Mobileye has been a quiet but key player in the self-driving car industry. For the past two decades, the Israel-based company has been developing camera sensors for cars. It has paved the way to today’s self-driving cars.
In recent years, the company has expanded its product line from car sensors to the entire technology stack powering self-driving cars. In fact, Tesla has been using Mobileye’s technology for its Autopilot feature.
And yet, we’re not there yet — current self-driving cars aren’t really smart. It’s still going to take years before end customers can buy fully autonomous vehicles. Called the BMW iNEXT, the first fully autonomous BMW car is going to lay down the foundations of BMW’s strategy on this front. Test drives will start next year.
The company also mentions potential ride-sharing use cases with a technology platform that would let BMW manage a fleet of autonomous vehicles. And this could affect many areas of the transportation industries — truck drivers, construction vehicles, etc.
The iNEXT should reach level 3 to level 5 of automated driving (“eyes off” to “driver off”). The three companies will then share this platform with other car manufacturers. With an open strategy, these companies could create a significant revenue stream through licensing deals and more.
But let’s talk about the elephant in the room as well. This announcement comes the day after it was revealed that the Tesla Model S autopilot feature was responsible for a fatal crash. There’s a long and winding road ahead before customers can trust self-driving cars. BMW, Intel and Mobileye need to be aware of all these challenges.
Update: Mobileye’s Chief Communications Officer Dan Galves has provided the following statement regarding the Tesla crash:
We have read the account of what happened in this case. Today’s collision avoidance technology, or Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) is defined as rear-end collision avoidance, and is designed specifically for that. This incident involved a laterally crossing vehicle, which current-generation AEB systems are not designed to actuate upon. Mobileye systems will include Lateral Turn Across Path (LTAP) detection capabilities beginning in 2018, and the Euro NCAP safety ratings will include this beginning in 2020.

TechCrunch has confirmed reports that auto startup Zoox is raising about $200 million at a $1 billion valuation. We’ve also learned that investors Lux Capital and DFJ are involved in the round.
The Palo Alto-based startup founded by Tim Kentley-Klay and Jesse Levinson, has been deliberately quiet about what they are working on presumably for competitive reasons, but the Zoox team has been working on autonomous vehicles for a few years now.
Zoox is said to be building technology that could compete with Google’s self-driving cars and Cruise Automation, which was recently acquired by GM.
Zoox made an appearance at the LA auto show in 2013.  Then these renderings of a “Boz” design emerged, lacking windshields, to emphasize the car’s autonomy.
Sources tells us that Zoox is more than a car that simply steers itself, but that every aspect of the car has been reinvented. They think that they have proprietary technology that could help them compete with Tesla.
As the technology improves with self-driving cars, there has been talk that Uber-like services will be purely automated. Significant investment has been poured into automotive startups, and traditional automakers, which have been slow to innovate, are likely to continue making acquisitions in the space.
We have reached out to Zoox for comment.

1080,Government regulators are looking into fatal Tesla crash involving Autopilot,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/30/tesla-crash/,2016/06/30,"
Tesla announced today that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened an investigation into a recent fatal crash of a Model S with the company’s Autopilot feature activated.
The accident took place on May 7th in a small West Florida town called Williston. The Florida Highway Patrol is also conducting its own investigation of the accident, according to a public affairs officer there.
The same officer reported that Tesla has, since the fatal accident in May, sent engineers down to Ocala, Florida to assist investigators in accessing data they needed to evaluate the causes of the crash.
Tesla offered an account of the event in a blog post titled “A Tragic Loss” that went up today, detailing the crash, an “extremely rare circumstance,” which occurred on a divided highway.
According to Tesla,
Neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied. The high ride height of the trailer combined with its positioning across the road and the extremely rare circumstances of the impact caused the Model S to pass under the trailer, with the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the Model S.
According to the carmaker, the vehicle’s crash safety system would have been activated had the Model S collided with the front or rear of the trailer, rather than the side. It also took great pains to reiterate the safety procedures it has set out for the Autopilot feature, which is still in the public beta phase.

The company isn’t offering much more in the way of details about the incident or driver, though it did note that he was “a friend of Tesla,” who has been involved in the EV and technology communities in general.

According to traffic crash records reviewed by TechCrunch, the victim was, in fact, a veteran of the U.S. Navy and famous fan of Tesla, Joshua D. Brown of Canton, Ohio.
Forty-year-old Brown also founded the customer fulfillment technology startup Nexu Innovations. He made news back in April when he posted a YouTube video of a near collision with a merging truck, which Autopilot effectively steered clear of.

When he died, Brown was driving the same black, 2015 Tesla Model S, the roof of which was torn off in a collision when a tractor-trailer turned at an intersection.
The driver of the other vehicle, a red, 2014 Freightliner Cascadia, was not injured.
According to the crash report, the Tesla ran off the road after the collision.
The NHTSA’s investigation could ultimately prove the first step toward a larger recall request from the organization, should the vehicles be deemed unsafe.
According to the agency Communications Director Bryan Thomas, “NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation will examine the design and performance of the automated driving systems in use at the time of the crash. During the Preliminary Evaluation, NHTSA will gather additional data regarding this incident and other information regarding the automated driving systems.”

1081,How the VW diesel settlement breaks down in dollars,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/30/how-the-vw-diesel-settlement-breaks-down-in-dollars/,2016/06/30,"
On Tuesday, June 28, Volkswagen finally announced an agreement with US federal regulators (including the FTC), private plaintiffs in the United States, and 44 states to settle its TDI diesel case to the tune of about $15 billion.
In case you need a refresher, in fall of 2015, researchers discovered that VW had engineered the software governing its TDI diesel engines to behave differently when being tested for emissions than they do when being driven normally. When the car detected a testing situation—steering wheel straight, certain speeds or rpms held for certain times—the engine ran cleaner, which sacrificed performance but passed the test. When driven normally, the performance increased, and so did the tailpipe emissions.
Here’s how the numbers break down in the settlement:

475,000 VW and Audi diesel vehicles will be bought back or have their leases terminated
If everyone eligible takes advantage of the settlement, that amounts to $10.33 billion, according to VW
VW will invest $2.7 billion in an “environmental remediation fund”
VW will invest $2 billion to promote the adoption of zero-emissions vehicles in the United States
VW will pay $603 million to 44 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico to resolve consumer protection claims

This only affects vehicles with the 2.0-liter TDI engines. There’s more resolution to come—and more money to be paid out—for the 3.0-liter TDI-engined vehicles.
If you’re a TDI owner, you’ve got a couple of choices. You can take a buyback or lease termination plus cash, or you can have your car modified to meet emissions standards. In the first case, the value for the buyback will be based on the Clean Trade-In Value published in September 2015 of the NADA Used Car Guide. In the second case, you keep the car (though the performance will likely suffer, if that’s a factor for you), and you get some cash from VW. The modification option is waiting on approval from the EPA and CARB before it can be implemented in customers’ cars.
Since the software dodge affects cars from 2009 through 2015, it’s possible that you may have owned a TDI and already sold it on or traded it in. Don’t fret—you may still be able to get some cash. There aren’t details on the website yet, but it’s worth keeping an eye on that provision if it applies to you.
No matter which option you may be eligible for or want to take advantage of, the paperwork has to be filed and approved by the court over the summer. Action can be taken by TDI owners to get some money or some modifications in fall 2016.

1082,Tesla and Toyota among the smartest and the most connected companies,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/28/tesla-and-toyota-are-both-the-smartest-and-the-most-connected-companies/,2016/06/28,"
Visiongain, an analysis firm based in the U.K., released a report this month listing the top 20 connected car companies, which includes all the usual suspects, such as Volvo, Ford and Honda. Tesla and Toyota were also among the top 10 automotive manufacturers in the connected car market, which Visiongain projects to be worth $35.7 billion in 2016 alone.
Toyota and Tesla also made the MIT Technology Review list of the 50 Smartest Companies in 2016, the only two automotive manufacturers to make the cut. Tesla landed at No. 4 on that list for advancing its autopilot technology in the Model S and Model X, and for generating nearly half a million pre-orders for its Model 3. Toyota, at No. 17, was noted for investing $1 billion in its Toyota Research Institute.
But those aren’t the only automotive companies to make the top 10 on MIT’s list. Mobileye is at No. 6 for being “a leader in driver assistance technology” and the fact that 600 of its employees are annotating the images that are used in training a fully autonomous driving system. Google’s Alphabet is at No. 8, and the list cites the autonomous car project’s 1.6 billion miles as a factor in the ranking.
The rest of the list includes companies expanding into this new and wide-open automotive space. NVIDIA, which supplies powerful graphics processing chips to manufacturers for autonomous driving, is at No. 12. At No. 21, Didi Chuxing is a Chinese rival for Uber that’s raised $7 billion so far in 2016, including $1 billion from Apple. Funnily enough, No. 23 is a spinoff company from A123 Systems, 24M. It’s working to create a more efficient — and cheaper — lithium-ion battery for both the electric grid and electric vehicles. Improbable creates VR software used in autonomous driving simulations.
Others on the list, like Microsoft and Bosch, have a hand in advanced automotive systems, as well. Driving — or autonomous driving, or being driven by a ride-sharing driver — is going to cause a sea change in American culture. These two lists point to the companies that are preparing for this change rather than cringing in the face of it.

1083,Cruise’s Kyle Vogt will speak about self-driving cars at Disrupt SF,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/28/cruises-kyle-vogt-will-speak-about-self-driving-cars-at-disrupt-sf/,2016/06/28,"
A few months ago, many people learned about San Francisco-based startup Cruise Automation for the first time. After raising around $19 million and quietly building sensors for self-driving cars, the company got acquired by General Motors. So the startup must know a thing or two about the future of cars. That’s why Cruise founder and CEO Kyle Vogt will join us on stage at Disrupt SF 2016.
Many tech companies, such as Velodyne LiDAR, Mobileye and Cruise have been partnering with car manufacturers to power their self-driving technologies. Velodyne LiDAR works with Ford, Mobileye works with Tesla and other manufacturers, and now, Cruise isn’t just working with General Motors but is part of it.
This way, General Motors can make sure that no other company will be able to use Cruise’s technology. But what makes it so special then?
The car manufacturer doesn’t want to rule on the tiny startup, that’s why Cruise remains an independent division within General Motors. The only thing that is going to change is that General Motors probably plans to ship many, many cars with Cruise’s technology so that the company can flip the switch on self-driving features when software is ready.
Vogt was one of the founders behind Justin.tv, Socialcam and Twitch. He then got involved in self-driving tech with Cruise.
But it’s still going to take five to ten years before full self-driving cars become available to the end consumer. In the mean time, Vogt can tell us the remaining steps to get there.

1084,Pandora hopes you’ll listen more in an Uber,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/27/pandora-hopes-youll-listen-to-more-stations-in-an-uber/,2016/06/27,"
Uber already integrates with Spotify so riders can pick their favorite tunes to jam to on their trip, but now Pandora is teaming up with the rideshare giant to do the same — this time for drivers.
It’s not clear how many riders actually use the Spotify integration but not many drivers seem to have the set up to use it. Anecdotally, one Uber driver told me he didn’t even know Uber offered this service for riders and I’ve seen other drivers struggle to get it to work through their phone jacks.
There’s also been some fear on the driver side that allowing passengers to choose the music de-humanizes the driver.
But nevermind that, Uber is now integrating with Pandora, too.
It’s a bit of a different experience on the driver’s side, though. For one, Pandora will be integrated within the driver app for easy navigation. Instead of switching out of the app, selecting Pandora, choosing a station, then closing out and hopping back into the Uber driver app, drivers will be able to select a station while picking up a rider and following the map to take them to their destination in the same app.
Pandora will also be ad-free (for the first six months) so drivers can choose the station they want without interruption as they pick up rides. Drivers can choose to pay the Pandora subscription or deal with ads after the six months are up.
The roll-out is part of a number of enhancements on the driver side Uber has been working on, including discounts and perks like a gas card and station finder.
Uber says they’ll also be offering drivers the needed aux cords so they will be able to blast their chosen Pandora stations inside their car and that the in-app Pandora feature will lower the music when they get a rider notification to make it easier to use Pandora while in the Uber driver app.
“Many drivers already use music to get their day started on the right note, but it can be challenging to find high-quality music that both drivers and riders love—without radio ads and interruptions to the music,” Uber senior product manager for music Bob Cowherd said.
The move is a boon to Pandora, which likely wants some of the younger Uber users as new listeners. Pandora is an older music platform and therefore grabs an older demographic than Spotify. According to one market intelligence study from Civic Science, less than half (45 percent) of Pandora listeners are under 29. 
Listenership is also steadily dropping on the music platform, going from 81.5 million monthly active listeners in 2015 to 81.1 million in 2016. Integration with the Uber driver app not only makes it easier for Uber drivers to use but also serves as free marketing to the millions of Uber riders.
Uber says it will maintain its Spotify partnership on the rider side — and told TechCrunch it will have more to come on that for riders —  but the partnership with Pandora helps Uber maintain a “seamless and collaborative music experience” for both rider and driver.

1085,The last driver license holder,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/24/the-last-driver-license-holder/,2016/06/24,"




Mario Herger
Contributor



Mario Herger is the CEO of consultancy firm Enterprise Garage.


Say hello to Liam. He recently celebrated his first birthday. Not only is he a cutie, he is the last person to get a driver license.
Impossible? Not in your lifetime?
I admit: I don’t know if Liam will be the last person to get a driver license. It could be Sophia or Ethan. This person may live right around the corner in your neighborhood. But one thing is certain: The last person to get a driver license is already born — the speed of technology development and recent announcements confirm that.
Digital players
The California DMV alone issued to 13 companies licenses for road testing autonomous technologies. Google alone has 58 test vehicles on roads across the U.S., counting for 80 percent of all registered test cars. Google has accumulated an impressive 1.6 million autonomously driven miles, adding between 10,000 and 15,000 miles every week. In total, this counts for 90 percent of all test miles driven in California. Added to that are 3 million simulated miles every day, according to Google’s January report.
Tesla, on the other hand, revealed that their customers have driven more than 100 million miles in Autopilot mode since its roll-out in October last year. And Elon Musk recently announced that Tesla is less than two years away from having a complete autonomous car. Uber and Baidu are just two more digital companies that started testing autonomous cars.
The technology is advancing rapidly. Given the overall number of miles driven and comparing them with the number of accidents, the cars are already as safe as human drivers: 12 accidents occurred with Google vehicles during the 1.6 million miles of road tests, and only two of them were the fault of the Google cars. The cars had an incident every 133,000 miles; this is on par with reported and non-reported human accidents with property damage.
Traditional players
Traditional automakers who’ve been asleep at the wheel for some time are now ramping up their efforts with the goal to catch up with those newcomers from the digital industries. Honda, Mercedes, Audi, Ford and GM all have test vehicles and are frantically acquiring technology or entering into partnerships like GM and Fiat. Even suppliers like Bosch got test licenses. Additionally, announcements involving BMW revealed that the focus of their i-series is shifting to autonomous vehicles; the release to the market is expected in 2021.
Singularity plays out
Following Ray Kurzweil’s statement on Singularity, we will see exponential acceleration in the development of the required digital power and intelligence of self-driving car AI. Conservative expectations that draw from past linear experiences may be coming faster than most of us expect through the exponential component.
Other players
AUTOSAR, an automotive system architecture for standardizing automotive electronic control units, is expected to have in its 2018 release version 4.4 everything included for autonomous driving. This system standard is expected to be included by 2020 in the cars built by its partners, including BMW, Ford, GM, Daimler, Volkswagen and Volvo.
Sensor technologies are also advancing rapidly, and prices are dropping. Modern cars are equipped with hundreds of sensors, including radar, cameras, GPS and accelerometers. Additionally required sensors such as Lidar are predicted to drop to a few hundred dollars in the next few years.
Technology research firm Vision Systems Intelligence listed all the companies that provide solutions for or drive autonomous technologies; the amount of companies is impressive. More than 200 companies work on autonomous driving solutions and — if we extrapolate trends from other hot industries — many more will follow.
Manually driven cars may even be outlawed or restricted to closed circuits.
While the technological components to make the cars work and safe are crucial, insurance companies and regulatory agencies could become drivers for rapid adoption. Given that 94 percent of accidents are caused by human error, the expected lower accident rate with self-driving cars may make insurance costs for human-driven cars prohibitively expensive. Although a majority of drivers today are still skeptical about handing over control to a machine, experiencing a self-driving car for themselves and seeing insurance rates go up for human drivers will quickly change that. Regulations may follow suit; by 2030, manually driven cars may even be outlawed or restricted to closed circuits.
The last driver
Given the facts of these joint efforts and the resources spent by major players, once Liam (or Sophia or Ethan) turns 16 in 2031, they will not be required or even allowed to get a driver license. Especially when we consider the dismal driving record of their age group. And they may not want to do it anyways. The Department of Transportation shows declining rates of driver license holders among teenagers, a trend that other countries also notice.

What autonomous driving is — and isn't — in 2016

All those developments bring us back to the question: What is the real task for a car? Not to give you the “joy of driving,” or “freedom” as car makers have been telling us. Cars are also not solving a mobility or transportation problem. Cars are connectors. They help us connect with other people, with places and with goods. However, the biggest competitor for connecting is in our pockets: the smartphone.
While in the past teens argued about who can be the driver, now they argue about who must be the driver. The passengers can stay connected with their smartphones, the driver cannot (the driver must focus on the road). A self-driving car allows everyone to be connected in all modes: virtually and in reality.
And this is why Liam (or Sophia or Ethan) will not really be excited to get a driver license, and will be the last one to take the exam at the DMV.

1086,Faraday Future says it is also making an autonomous car,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/24/faraday-future-says-it-is-also-making-an-autonomous-car/,2016/06/24,"
Chinese-backed electric car maker Faraday Future says it is working on a self-driving vehicle.
The company not so secretly owned by LeTV joins a growing list of tech companies making autonomous cars, including Google, Tesla, Apple (big rumor) and even IBM now powers a self-driving bus.
Faraday revealed its first concept car, the FFZERO1, at CES earlier this year — an electric car with the look of a Hot Wheels toy. The car was said to be made with a variable platform architecture (VPA), and came with what the company referred to as a “UFO line” design dividing the black and silver body of the vehicle. It also came equipped with a space helmet for some reason.
Faraday’s chief engineer seemed full of buzzwords about the car and little else at the time — leaving many to wonder just what was under the hood.
Meanwhile, Faraday’s parent company has been busy launching its own electric vehicle and an autonomous taxi and it seems Faraday is following suit.
We don’t know much about the new car, but the company has recently acquired an Autonomous Vehicle Tester (AVT) permit in California, which will allow it to start testing a self-driving car on public roads in the state.
California has so far granted permission to 14 companies to test autonomous vehicles on public roads, including GM’s Cruise Automation, Google, Volkswagen and now Faraday.
But the company is placing its bets beyond the Golden State. Faraday reportedly plans to start testing self-driving vehicles in Detroit, Michigan, as well. According to The Detroit News, the company approached Kirk Steudle, director of the Michigan Department of Transportation, in January to ask how to apply for autonomous vehicle plates.
Though Faraday has yet to produce a working prototype car, it says it will be testing autonomous driving software, sensors, hardware and user interfaces in “real-world” environments in each state.
California law requires a test driver to be present inside driverless vehicles and Faraday says it is working on a car that will allow those inside to switch from manual to autonomous mode.

1087,Used BMW i batteries store solar power at home,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/23/used-bmw-i-batteries-store-solar-power-at-home/,2016/06/23,"
BMW i joins Tesla and Mercedes-Benz in bringing energy storage home with its new system, which has yet to be given a catchy name. The system uses new or used batteries from the BMW i3 electric car to store power from solar panels for later use. It integrates with the charging station users are likely to have in the garage, so the stored energy from the sun can power your i3 overnight.
Basically, if you keep your i3 long enough that the battery outlives its useful lifespan as a power source for your car, you can recycle it yourself. This system is plug-and-play, according to BMW’s press release, so you can use the battery’s remaining storage power in the stationary system after you get a replacement battery for the car.
BMW i is also anticipating the near-future availability of second-life batteries, which would be retired batteries from other people’s i3 cars. Because the i3 has only been in production since 2013 (as a 2014 model year), there’s going to be several years of lag time before those batteries are ready to be recycled for in-home storage. But early batteries used in the Mini E test fleet have already been installed in a similar capacity at the University of San Diego, and energy distributor NextEra has already signed a contract for 20 MWh of second-life batteries, the largest order of used automotive batteries so far.
The BMW i lithium-ion battery has a capacity of 22 kWh or 33 kWh. The company says that’s enough to power a typical American household, which uses 15-30 kWh day, for up to 24 hours. The BMW Group Technology Office is partnering with Pacific Gas & Electric Company and i3 owners in California to study how home energy storage and charge management can lower the overall cost of EV ownership. The study allows BMW to delay or interrupt charging during peak times, so if range anxiety is one of your EV issues, this might not be the study for you.

1088,Tesla gets more than solar panels with offer to acquire SolarCity,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/21/tesla-gets-more-than-solar-panels-with-offer-to-acquire-solarcity/,2016/06/21,"
News of an offer from Tesla to acquire SolarCity came mostly unexpected to traders earlier this afternoon. In a rapid “knee-jerk” reaction, traders bid up SolarCity by 13 percent and sent Tesla tumbling down 12 percent.

Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) Stock Price | FindTheCompany

It is typical for the stock of an acquisition target to spike while the acquirer’s stock falls according to Michael Morosi of Avondale Partners.
SolarCity has a debt-to-equity ratio of 3.492 as of March 2016. Tesla has a ratio of 3.215 as of the same date.
Tesla is in a unique position as an automaker because its market is still largely undeveloped. Competitors in the space like Fiat Chrysler and General Motors have much lower ratios in the ballpark of 1.6 and 1.7 respectively. Ford is a notable exception, but for the most part, Tesla has an elevated debt to equity ratio.
The good news for Tesla is that most of the debt held by SolarCity is project-level debt. Morosi noted that such debt is consolidated on the SolarCity balance sheet but is all set against cash flow producing assets. This means the debt behaves much more like mortgage debt than credit card debt.
SolarCity does have an outstanding convertible note and it is out-of-the-money, added Morosi. SolarCity also has a highly visible burn-rate and has yet to achieve cash-flow breakeven. Tesla will have to attend to SolarCity’s debt and cash-flow as the deal gets closer to reality.
Tesla and SolarCity have long been intertwined companies. Elon Musk and Antonio Gracias have both recused themselves from any decision-making on the acquisition given their overlapping roles in the two companies.
Morosi added that an acquisition of SolarCity will complicate Tesla’s financial reporting. SolarCity can only recognize a fraction of its yearly revenue from a GAAP perspective which could reflect poorly on Tesla’s side. It’s also going to be harder to separate growth of the company’s core automotive business from more speculative investments in the future of energy.
The generous 21 percent to 30 percent premium that Tesla offered to SolarCity has largely been erased by markets. If that deal was made based on the current price of SolarCity stock, the premium would be closer to 8 percent and 15 percent.

Solarcity Corporation (SCTY) Stock Price | FindTheCompany

Most analysts expect SolarCity to continue operating as normal even after the transaction date. Tesla largely has its hands full with the rollout of the Tesla Model 3. The role of SolarCity in the Tesla ecosystem will ultimately be a play for the future.
There is also agreement that the Tesla move is bold. Tesla is still four years away from its target to hit full capacity at its lithium-ion Gigafactory. More details over time should help ease worries that Tesla acted too brashly with the acquisition. The decision could be as simple as seeing a good price and taking the opportunity regardless of timing.
“Tesla doesn’t view this as a reaction to GE breathing down their necks,” said Troy Ault, Director of Research at Cleantech Group.
Tesla looks at the battery side as a commodity play added Ault. Tesla is likely hedging a bet toward future battery innovation. Time will tell how it will integrate into vehicle technology.

1089,See Jane Go is bringing women-only ride hailing to the West Coast,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/21/see-jane-go-is-bringing-women-only-ride-hailing-to-the-west-coast/,2016/06/21,"
Earlier this spring, Safeher (the ride-hailing service formerly known as Chariot for Women) established itself in the Boston area as a safer service for women drivers and passengers. Now See Jane Go is starting a similar service for women in the greater Los Angeles area this summer. Its public launch is today, with a commercial launch coming at the end of July.
William Jordan founded the company in January of this year when his teenage daughters expressed interest in riding with or even driving for companies like Uber and Lyft. That sparked a conversation about the safety and personal comfort issues in taking rides from — or giving rides to — strange men. Jordan noticed there was an unmet opportunity for a service that catered to women and used women drivers.
See Jane Go isn’t worried about competition from Safeher; besides the sheer distance between the two services currently, “it validates that there is a market,” said CEO Kimberly Toonen in a phone interview. See Jane Go used focus groups to determine that if there was a women-only service that wasn’t radically more expensive or had much slower response times than established services like Uber and Lyft, women would select See Jane Go “all day long,” Toonen said.
Toonen said See Jane Go was surprised to learn that only about 15% of people have used a ride-hail service, despite how ubiquitous Uber and Lyft seem. She was less surprised to learn that only about a quarter of these services’ drivers are women. “They’ve shied away from this business opportunity,” she said.
See Jane Go drivers go through criminal background checks and a driving history review before being brought on board. Drivers must supply their licenses with their applications, and the self-identified gender on the license is all the validation the company requires. LGBTQ+ drivers and riders “will absolutely be able to use this service,” Toonen said.
The company also aims to create “stickiness” for drivers so that they’ll drive more and pick up more rides. To that end, See Jane Go is working to partner with an as-yet-unnamed manufacturer on its 30 Rides program. Any driver who provides 30 rides in a month in their new car has their car payment covered to the tune of about $300, according to Toonen. “Drivers get a really nice deal on a brand-new car,” she said. “And it might help those women who don’t have a car currently, or they are sharing a car in a one-car household, or they have a car that needs replacing.” (See Jane Go requires that vehicles be less than 11 years old.)
Like most apps, the See Jane Go app includes a 5-star rating system for users. But it also gives drivers and passengers the ability to favorite each other. The feature increases the chances that someone will be paired with her favorite rider or driver. “It’s not a guarantee that you’ll get Sally instead of Betty,” Toonen said, “but it’s a smart algorithm so that your favorite driver will come up in the queue. They’ll get the hail before anyone else.”
See Jane Go has big plans for the future, including tapping into the networking potential of so many women giving and taking rides across the country — and eventually around the globe. “We want to emphasize the fact that women, by the nature of the sharing economy, have largely been excluded. This is an opportunity to participate in the gig economy. We’re creating a community of women helping women to achieve goals, whether they’re personal or professional.”
Update 6/22/16: Edited to fix a typo; only 15% of people in the US have used a ride hail service, not 35%.

With a lot of tech companies and automakers staking their claims in the connected car space, now there are signs that others are looking to move in, too. Today, telecoms giant Verizon announced that it is acquiring Telogis, a California-based company that develops cloud-based solutions for mobile workforces, and specifically telematics, compliance and navigation software used by Ford, Volvo, GM and other car companies, as well as Apple and AT&T.
Financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed, although we’ll try to find out. (Note/disclaimer: We are owned by Verizon, by way of AOL. This gives us no inside track whatsoever when it comes to news.) Considering that Verizon in 2015 reported full-year revenues of $131.6 billion, the price would have to be very high to be considered “material” and may not be made public for some time, if ever.

Back in 2013 when KPCB made its investment (which was the first from a VC firm in the company), Telogis told TechCrunch it was profitable and forecasting revenues of $100 million annually for the year.
It’s not clear what size those revenues are now, but if it was on the same growth trajectory as before the funding, sales would be around $150 million annually, with profitability, at the moment.
Other investors include some very notable strategics: the investment arm of General Motors, and Fontinalis Partners, which also invests in Lyft and was co-founded by Bill Ford, the executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company.
Before the acquisition, Verizon actually had a business in fleet management and telematics; in fact, the two companies competed against each other for business from the trucking and other industries. Verizon Telematics, as the business is called, is active in 40 countries. But in a way, Verizon buying Telogis is a sign that the latter may have proved to be the more superior, and the one with the key customer deals.
“With a comprehensive enterprise product portfolio and partnerships with some of the world’s leading vehicle and equipment manufacturers, Telogis brings a world-class software platform and new distribution relationships to Verizon Telematics’ already expansive suite of connected vehicle solutions for consumers and enterprise customers,” said Andrés Irlando, CEO of Verizon Telematics, in a statement. It’s not clear how and if some of those pre-exisiting relationships, in particular with Apple and AT&T, will be impacted by the Verizon acquisition.
“The combined strengths of our two companies’ unique assets better enable us to deliver best-in-class mobile enterprise management services to customers globally, while building scale and accelerating market share. I’m confident that the passion and talent of our collective employees will continue to drive revenue growth and product innovations to shape and lead the industry for years to come.”
It’s not clear why Telogis never went ahead on its IPO a couple of years ago. More generally, the consolidation in the space in which it works, and the fact that it’s Verizon doing the acquiring, points to other bigger trends in the industry.
Driven by the rise of outsized “startups” like Uber and Lyft that are reimagining transportation and (the costly move into) logistics; moves made from big car companies and tech giants; and the emergence of a new class of startups that are specifically pinpointing things like telematics and the commercial transportation/trucking industry, autos are seen by some as the next big platform for connected services.
Or, at least one key piece of hardware that is ripe for disruption. So it’s no surprise to see that Verizon also wants a seat at the table, not least because telematics and in-car enterprise services, which tap into Verizon’s own mobile data network, are already an area where it is active.
“Verizon provides the brand equity, strength in the market, broad infrastructure and expansive global reach to take Telogis to the next level,” said David Cozzens, CEO, Telogis, in a statement. “This strategic acquisition positions our collective technologies and services uniquely in the market while also enabling Verizon Telematics’ industry-leading business to benefit from Telogis’ unmatched strength in the enterprise market, innovative Mobile Enterprise Management software platform and our strong OEM and ecosystem partnerships.”
The acquisition is expected to close in the second half of 2016, Verizon said.
In connection with the transaction, PJT Partners and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC acted as financial advisors and Debevoise & Plimpton acted as legal advisor to Verizon. Barclays and J.P. Morgan acted as financial advisors and Paul Hastings LLP acted as legal advisor to Telogis.

1091,More cars than phones were connected to cell service in Q1,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/20/more-cars-than-phones-were-connected-to-cell-service-in-q1/,2016/06/20,"
Millions of people in the United States have mobile phones, and we’ve had them for years. We may upgrade phones or change plans, but cell phones and plans are generally sold to people who already have devices. But cellular services aren’t out of new devices to connect—now they’ve got cars. In the first quarter of 2016, connected cars accounted for a third of all new cellular devices.
Mobile-industry consultants at Chetan Sharma noted that there were more cars added to networks than phones and fewer tablets than previously. According to analysts, smartphone penetration is at 84% in the United States, and new customer revenue is approaching zero. But connected cars are still new to the market, so as they roll off assembly lines and into garages, they’ll need to be hooked up to a network.
AT&T has 8 million cars on its network, “probably the highest of any mobile operator in the world,” the report said, and it’s adding more cars than all other operators combined. The company provides communications for everything from vehicle-to-vehicle capabilities, telematics, entertainment apps, over-the-air updates, and 4G LTE hotspots built into the vehicle.
Not that people necessarily know their cars are connected at all. A survey of 3,700 drivers in Europe by TNS and the BearingPoint Institute this spring found that 4 in 10 were unaware that the cars they owned already had connectivity features on board. The other 6 of those 10 people said that connected features influenced their decision to buy a particular vehicle. Connectivity was rated “an important criteria at purchase” by 32% of respondents. So it seems that either buyers are searching for connected cars, or they don’t know anything about the technology, even if its baked right into their new cars.
The TNS study also showed that while about half of the respondents were shown how the technology worked at the dealership when they were considering purchasing a vehicle, there were complaints that buyers seemed to know as much as the salespeople when it came to connected features. In its analysis of the study, TNS called in-car education “critical to the uptake and use of connectivity”—especially for those 4 in 10 who aren’t even aware of what their car can do.

1092,Liability in the coming age of autonomous autos,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/16/liability-in-the-coming-age-of-autonomous-autos/,2016/06/16,"
While we are many years away from an autonomous utopia, where cars pick us up and drive us where we need to go without a human at the wheel, we are seeing the first steps toward self-driving cars. Volvo, Honda, Audi, Tesla—pretty much every auto manufacturer, plus Google and probably Apple—is incorporating advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) into cars we can buy right now.
As humans transfer driving tasks to computers, it raises questions for the insurance industry. There will still be crashes on the way to that autonomous utopia, and insurance companies want to know who’s going to pay. Volvo, for one, has stepped up to say that when one of its vehicles is in autonomous mode, Volvo is responsible for what happens. But that’s a rarity so far.
Does the liability lie with the human for not overriding the system? The manufacturer for not testing thoroughly enough? The Tier 1 supplier of sensors? The company that supplied the Tier 1 supplier with a part for the sensor? And at what point should insurers panic?
Andrew Rose of Compare.com, an insurance comparison site, tells insurers, “You need to be completely freaked out by the idea of autonomous cars—and completely relaxed.” He said in a phone interview that in 30 years, it’s likely most of the auto insurance business will be gone. Autonomous vehicles will wreck less over time, which means lower premiums will be required to cover losses, and therefore less auto insurance will be required. “Insurers can relax,” Rose said, “because it’s going to take time to get there.”
Compare.com is part of the Admiral Group, one of the largest motor insurance companies globally. In preparation for our interview, Rose, who happened to be at Admiral HQ in the UK, asked to pull information on all the accidents that involved autonomous claims. He was told, “We don’t have any yet,” though there are millions of vehicles in the United Kingdom covered by Admiral Group. “People aren’t making those claims yet,” Rose told me, “But it’s out there on the horizon.”
One reason claims aren’t being made yet is that manufacturers are being incredibly cautious about releasing this technology to the marketplace because of the huge implications of getting it wrong. Volvo has been working on its autonomous system for a decade or more, giving it the confidence to accept liability. “Getting little things wrong is no big deal,” Rose said, “but if adaptive cruise control fails, that could be catastrophic.”
While we wait for an all-autonomous future, insurance companies are likely going to want to find the car manufacturer at fault because they want to find somebody else to pay for the accident. “Volvo says that while in autonomous mode, we are responsible,” Rose noted. “But they’re not going to let you break the law. The system won’t let you do 66 mph in a 65-mph zone.”
That becomes tricky on this path to autonomy, because in the intervening years, autonomous cars are more likely to get in accidents—through no fault of their own. “They get hit more,” Rose said, “because they do exactly what the law prescribes.” This is exactly the situation that the Google car found itself in when it collided with that bus. “This is the ball of yarn that we’re pulling one thread on right now,” Rose said. “It’ll be much easier when more autonomous cars are interacting with each other.”

1093,How do you truly secure the connected car?,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/15/how-do-you-truly-secure-the-connected-car/,2016/06/15,"




Oren Betzaleli
Contributor


Oren Betzaleli is the vice president and general manager of Redbend Software Management product unit, HARMAN Connected Services.


We’ve become accustomed to staying connected whenever and wherever we are. From Instagramming our exotic summer vacations to receiving alerts from our smartwatches about our next meeting — even ordering groceries via our mobile devices to skip the line — we have more than enough ways to stay tuned in 24/7.
For better or worse, the fear of missing out (a.k.a. FOMO) is real, and businesses are quick to capitalize. To integrate the connected experience into everyday situations, retail stores have installed beacons at malls to alert us of promotions. CNN and The New York Times can now alert us to the latest headline-grabbing news in real time.
A more novel and practical use case of how this is coming to life can be found in the healthcare industry. Last year, healthcare IT solution provider eClinicalWorks integrated its subsidiary, Healow (Health & Online Wellness) with wearable devices and fitness trackers. Through this integration, patient data from these wearables seamlessly integrates with personal health records. The synchronization instantly provides medical providers with the most up-to-date and useful information, taking healthcare service to the next level.
All this connectivity is great, but it has also blinded us to the associated risks of being online at all times. As 60 Minutes recently highlighted, connected devices — especially smartphones — are vulnerable to cyber attacks from hackers, so security is of the utmost importance. Just a little further down the road is the next major connected device: the vehicle. Admittedly, connected cars come with some well-founded safety concerns.
While most of us aren’t overly concerned about our phones and computers being vulnerable to the threat of a cyber attack, we cannot afford to become complacent in safeguarding our cars. The stakes are higher when it comes to our vehicles — so high, in fact, that the FBI and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shared a joint formal announcement cautioning drivers of the increased risks that come with connected vehicles.
Like phone security, car data security is not always assured. Skilled hackers can and will find data and sell it to the highest bidder — or exploit it in other ways. Connected cars layer in an added risk to driving, as drivers’ well-being can be in jeopardy if something goes awry. While hackers generally tend to access private data and systems for personal gain, they do have the ability to take control of connected vehicles and make unexpected stops or turns, which could cause accidents.
Just last year, an experiment showed how researchers hacked a reporter’s vehicle, taking over the transmission, steering and brakes. With GSMA Research estimating 100 percent of all cars will be connected by 2035 and that 75 percent will be autonomous by 2025, there’s an immediate need to educate the public on the various facets of car connectivity and safety.
Nothing stops the hackers from continually trying to find and exploit new vulnerabilities. 
Concerned drivers must be made aware of the solutions available to reduce the vulnerabilities of a connected car. There are a multitude of solution options to help protect connected cars from cyber attacks, including secured hardware components at the chip level for secured operating systems and isolation and sandboxing capabilities that network protection at different layers (e.g. firewall) — all available to assuage drivers’ safety concerns and alleviate auto manufacturers’ cyber attack worries.
However, even with all these mechanisms in place, nothing stops the hackers from continually trying to find and exploit new vulnerabilities. The only way to mitigate this ongoing risk is to enable the in-vehicle systems to learn new ways to fight back. To achieve this, connected cars need mechanisms that continuously update the vehicle software with the newest and most advanced security features. These updates can be done either manually at the dealer, or automatically over the air.
Over-the-air (OTA) updates are used in a multitude of growing technology spaces today, including GPS, smartphones, tablets and more. In fact, there are currently more than 10 million vehicles equipped with the capability to receive software updates over the air. Similar to that of a smartphone receiving operating system updates and enhancements from the manufacturer, OTA updates allow car manufacturers and their suppliers to effectively manage all software components within the connected car.
Given this capability, auto manufacturers can enable vehicles to mitigate any new cyber threats without calling the cars back to the dealers. OTA updates automatically sync with connected cars to ensure all software is current at all times, helping provide future-proof security coverage, cost savings and increased customer loyalty.
Future-proof security coverage throughout the automotive lifecycle
To keep the car secured throughout its lifecycle, we must be able to update it at any point in time. OTA updates are the most effective and efficient way to accomplish this — they keep a car safe and circumvent potential cyber attacks, providing a tremendous security advantage over other vehicles.
As consumer demand for connectivity rises in tandem with solid security needs, automotive manufacturers are increasingly adding smart components to the car development process. The added benefit of ingraining smart technologies early on is that the embedded software continuously receives updates from the moment the connected vehicle rolls off the production line to the end of the vehicle’s lifespan.
Software-related recalls have doubled within the past few years — soon they’ll match mechanical recalls.
OTA updates ensure that connected cars always have up-to-date maps and the latest cybersecurity features. Utilizing OTA, in-vehicle GPS units can quickly deploy updates of new user interface elements, maps and points of interest to the infotainment platform. Additionally, OTA-enabled vehicles have the advantage of deep-rooted analytics and prognostics, which monitor all vehicle diagnostics for optimal performance levels at all times.
Simply put, connected cars with OTA-embedded updates operate with a higher level of safety and security throughout the automotive lifespan, giving automotive manufacturers — not hackers — the upper hand.
OTA updates make life more convenient for car owners, as well. Rather than physically bringing a vehicle to the dealership for repairs or waiting for another form of manual installation for a software update, OTA updates are instant, seamless and secure, so drivers can continue riding while upgrades are made. Additionally, their monitoring capability enables vehicles to receive warnings about malfunctioning parts ahead of a breakdown.
With this, car owners are able to better service their vehicles, ensuring consistent in-person security, as well as top-notch cybersecurity. By eliminating the need for physical software transfers, automotive manufacturers now have the ability to keep vehicles safely and securely running for an extended period of time without maintenance interruptions.
Cost and time savings through reduced recalls and warranties
Recall and warranty issues tend to be quite painful for consumers and extremely costly for automotive manufacturers. It’s safe to say any innovation that prevents maintenance trips and spending would be welcomed. Software-related recalls have doubled within the past few years — soon they’ll match mechanical recalls.
Software malfunctions, such as the breakdown of GPS navigation and Bluetooth connectivity systems, are the leading cause of these recalls. In fact, of the $6.9 billion in recalls, CX3 Marketing’s research attributes 6.4 percent, amounting to $436 million, to software.
Consumers want a car that works at every point of interaction — without complications, security attacks or malfunctions.
Today, cars can have more than 125 individual software-driven electronic control units (ECU). Inside the connected car, there are 100 million lines of code, and that number is growing exponentially. Software veteran Steve McConnell says that the industry average finds approximately 15 to 50 errors per 1,000 lines of delivered code. As such, it is nearly impossible to manually catch every security flaw or breach before someone with a malicious intent finds out and corrupts the software.
Luckily, OTA updates are an innovation in car software that reduces the likelihood for recalls and guards systems against hackers and security breaches. They have key benefits, such as a small on-device footprint, enhanced operational reliability and platform- and OS-agnosticism for a solid fit with any connected vehicle system. Software updates continually reduce the level of required physical maintenance. As a result, vehicles will be protected over time and have fewer recalls and warranty issues.
Ensuring customer satisfaction and loyalty
As soon as we drive away from the dealer in our new cars, what we envision is all the amazing road trips we’ll take with friends and family. Most of us don’t picture multiple trips to the dealership to update software throughout the year. OTA updates provide customer service benefits for today’s car owners, including instant enhancements, reduced maintenance costs and an extended vehicle lifespan, which ultimately increase brand loyalty.
To roll out its new Autopilot feature, Tesla offered Model S owners with the Autopilot hardware who did not purchase the feature a 30-day, free trial. This barely scratches the surface for what’s possible. The combination of keeping customers safe through regular updates and the opportunity to try new features before making a final purchase decision will be key to fortifying customer loyalty to car manufacturers.

A recent public service announcement puts the onus on consumers to remain vigilant about their software updates, but there’s a chance connected components won’t receive critical updates manually in a timely manner. The lack of convenience involved in updating software at a dealership will inevitably result in car owners missing updates here and there.
Unlike any other connected device, avoiding software updates in vehicles gives hackers the ability to access data and/or control key car components, resulting in life-threatening danger. In the United States alone, there are 2.35 million people injured or disabled in car accidents. Situations where the driver could lose control because of malicious individuals necessitate OTA updates to protect car owners from cyber attacks.
At the end of the day, consumers want a car that works at every point of interaction — without complications, security attacks or malfunctions. Similar to that of wearables, phones and other devices, there’s an unspoken assumption for ease of use, interactivity and security with each connected experience. As we move forward with connected cars, OTA updates will serve as that invisible hand guiding drivers toward truly secure and effortless experiences on the road.

Uber faces a growing number of legal troubles these days – the latest involves a court settlement of $7.5 million for background checks.
Uber has agreed to pay the $7.5 million sum to a group of San Francisco drivers alleging the company acquired consumer background reports without asking them first.
Uber also agreed to pay $100 million to San Francisco and Massachusetts drivers in April and faces a nation-wide class-action lawsuit as well as a lawsuit from the New York Taxi Workers Alliance. And those are just some of the legal issues in the U.S.
Uber faces mounting legal troubles all over the globe right now. Travis Kalanick, Uber’s CEO and co-founder, might chalk some of that up to the price you pay for disruption but the drivers obviously see it a different way in this case and others.
An Uber spokesperson was not available for comment on this latest case, and neither were the lawyers representing the drivers.
However, the lawyers representing the drivers in this background checks case have filed a memorandum of understanding in court today and are reportedly in the process of drafting a formal settlement.

1095,The Car Hacker’s Handbook digs into automotive data security,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/14/the-car-hackers-handbook-digs-into-automotive-data-security/,2016/06/14,"
In the coming age of autonomous cars, connected cars, and cars that can communicate with each other, the city’s infrastructure, our phones, and the entire internet of things, data security is going to be paramount. That’s why Craig Smith, who has spent 20 years working in banking and healthcare digital security, wrote The Car Hacker’s Handbook: A Guide for the Penetration Tester. Which is just as intimidating as it sounds.
Smith first published a version of the book in 2014 as a companion to a one-day class on car hacking. He offered it for free online, and it was downloaded 300,000 times in the first four days. There was a larger interest in this subject than he realized in teaching one-day classes at Virginia Tech and the US Cyber Challenge. And his ISP shut down his website.
When he started the OpenGarages.org online community, Smith figured it would be a bunch of security professionals who showed up. That was not the case. “It was a bunch of mechanics and performance tuners,” he said. “I was the only security person. It was a nice expansion, but it shows there’s a much bigger issue here.” When owners and mechanics are locked out of the data, they’re locked out of how their own cars work in a way people weren’t before vehicles became computers on wheels. And with data being so important to our driving experience, Smith asks, “Who owns the vehicle? After I pay $30,000 or more for a car, do I own it, or does the manufacturer?”
Not that every car owner needs to know how to hack or secure their own vehicle. “The expectation is that the manufacturer has done proper security tests,” Smith said. “But you need some method for third party review.” He brought up that Volkswagen was betting on the fact that no one could check the data in its diesel-powered vehicles during emissions tests. “When you have more independent review, whether it’s a mechanic or the owner, things come to light quicker,” Smith believes.
At nearly 300 pages, The Car Hacker’s Handbook covers a lot of potential security risks, and as autonomous systems become more ubiquitous and sophisticated, there could be even more risks. So is Smith worried about the potential for bad guys to take over our cars? “The car has multiple sensors, and they don’t trust each other always,” Smith said. “The design architecture of sensors is hard to hack; it’s hard to fool senses and sensors. Unless I can get to the core, decision-making piece, I would have to fake out every sensor. You’d think they would be easier to hack, but self-driving cars don’t have a trusted space for data the same way that a corporation that keeps its data behind a firewall would.”
The worst-case scenario for Smith isn’t the remote-driving takeover hack demonstrated last summer. “Unless they’re a sociopath, a hacker doesn’t want to drive the car,” he said. “It’s not that useful. The real value is in stealing data. Information is more valuable than physical damage.”
Does this leave us with the choice of never driving again or reverting to a vintage Model T to keep our data safe? “Being a security guy, I’m pessimistic and extra paranoid,” he said. “There’s been a lot of change in the past five years, but [the automotive industry is] an old industry. We’re ahead of malicious activity, but I don’t know how easy it will be to fix legacy systems.” The pessimistic, paranoid security expert leaves us with this ray of hope: “I don’t think we’re in a bad spot.”

The biggest threat facing connected autonomous vehicles is cybersecurity
What will a driverless future actually look like?




As companies race to bring autonomous vehicles (AVs) to market, investment activity in the space is heating up.
General Motors made headlines in March when it paid over $1 billion for Cruise Automation. A few weeks later leading venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz entered the space, announcing investments in two early-stage autonomous startups, Comma.ai and Dispatch.
Most recently, secretive AV startup Zoox raised a massive $250 million funding round, making it Silicon Valley’s newest unicorn. These and other recent deals point to a growing investment frenzy as AVs get closer to mainstream commercialization.
The AV investment landscape is complex. It includes both hardware and software players and features competitors ranging from early-stage startups to large publicly traded corporations. This article will provide a primer for those interested in the rapidly evolving AV space.
Hardware
Vehicles
The first and most obvious layer of the AV ecosystem is the vehicle itself. The capital investment and manufacturing expertise required to produce vehicles at scale largely preclude early-stage entrants from being active here. Even large, deep-pocketed technology companies investing heavily in an autonomous future — e.g. Google and Uber — seem unwilling and unlikely to become car manufacturers themselves.
The most probable outcome therefore seems to be that traditional car manufacturers will continue to mass-produce vehicles in the autonomous age. It is unclear whether this manufacturing role will continue to be as profitable for these companies as it has in the past. As value creation in transportation shifts toward high-tech components and software, manufacturers of the cars themselves may become an increasingly commoditized, low-margin business.
Virtually every traditional car manufacturer has by now begun to invest in autonomous vehicle capabilities. Those with particularly interesting autonomous programs include GM, Volvo and Mercedes-Benz. (While Tesla manufactures cars, it is more appropriately considered a technology company.)
Lidar sensors
Lidar is one of several types of specialized sensors that allow AVs to interpret their environment. Lidar sensors give the vehicle a precise three-dimensional awareness of its surroundings by projecting lasers in all directions and measuring the time they take to rebound, a process analogous to radar (the word Lidar is a portmanteau of “light” and “radar”).
Given how critical these components are for overall AV functionality, the market for Lidar sensors will be enormous. A handful of startups have recently emerged that specialize in their production.
Two key dimensions of these sensors are their size and their cost; the company that can harness Moore’s Law to drive both of these down the fastest will have a huge advantage. The Lidar sensors that Google used for its initial AV prototypes reportedly cost $80,000, an impracticable price point for the mass market.
The current market leader in Lidar production, Velodyne, priced its most recent sensor at $500. Velodyne, a privately held company based in California, has yet to take any venture funding.
Another California-based Lidar startup that has attracted positive attention recently is Quanergy. Quanergy has announced that its sensors will cost only $250 and have no moving parts. The company has established relationships with a handful of large OEMs but has yet to bring a product to market.
Cameras
Like Lidar sensors, cameras help AVs understand their environment and maneuver accordingly. Though less precise than Lidar, cameras offer the significant advantage of being able to detect color—important when, for instance, identifying traffic lights and signs.
The dominant player in AV camera production is a publicly traded Israeli company named Mobileye. Mobileye has high-profile supplier contracts with a number of auto manufacturers including Tesla.
Computer chips
Perhaps the most important piece of AV hardware is the computer chip that serves as the vehicle’s “brains.” These chips take inputs from the vehicle’s various sensors and, based on complex software algorithms (discussed further below), enable the vehicle to operate autonomously. As with microprocessors in personal computers, these components sit at the very center of the overall system’s functionality.
Given the enormous computing power demanded, AVs will require state-of-the-art microprocessors. The established chipmakers that have long dominated the microprocessor market — Nvidia, Qualcomm and Intel — seem poised to leverage their existing expertise to succeed with AV chips. All three companies have signaled that autonomous technology will be a strategic priority moving forward.
Of the three, Nvidia is arguably taking this opportunity seriously and investing most heavily in it. Investors have taken notice, with the company’s stock trading near an all-time high.
Software
While the hardware described above is essential, AVs are able to act intelligently, or autonomously, because of their software. There are several different key types of AV software to be aware of.
It is worth noting that the divide between hardware and software companies, while helpful as a framework, is not entirely clean. Some hardware companies — e.g. Mobileye — also provide software to analyze their sensor data. Likewise, some companies classified below as software players also offer hardware as part of an end-to-end autonomous solution.
Mapping and localization
The first category of software critical to AVs is mapping and localization.
In order to effectively navigate, an AV must have a detailed and up-to-date map of its surroundings and must know where on that map it is located. Creating and continually updating such a map database is a massively challenging exercise.
The two biggest players specializing in digital worldwide map database creation are HERE and TomTom. Each of these companies has attracted significant investment attention — no surprise, given that maps will be a key strategic asset for the AV industry.
A coalition of German automakers including Audi, BMW and Daimler recently acquired HERE for around $3 billion (outbidding Uber, among others).
TomTom, a publicly traded company based in Amsterdam, has faced acquisition rumors for years by suitors including Apple; to date the company remains independent. Apple, Uber and Bosch all have partnerships to use TomTom’s data.
Meanwhile, other AV players — notably Google and Uber — are seeking to build mapping capabilities themselves, while a handful of smaller startups are also tackling this challenge.
Cybersecurity
As vehicles become increasingly connected to the Internet, other vehicles and surrounding infrastructure, cybersecurity will become an increasingly prominent concern. In an important warning of the potential dangers of connected vehicles, white-hat hackers last year remotely took control of a Jeep Cherokee and cut its transmission.
Entrepreneurs and investors are becoming active in AV cybersecurity. As examples, Tel Aviv-based Argus Cyber Security raised $26 million in Series B funding last year, auto electronics maker Harman paid $72.5 million for cybersecurity startup TowerSec in March, and newcomer Karamba Security raised $2.5 million in seed funding in April. More competitors will no doubt emerge soon.
Fleet operations and management
As the autonomous age dawns, many predict that private car ownership will become obsolete, replaced by shared AV fleets that individuals summon only when needed. The task of managing these fleets and optimizing their routes will be an immense challenge requiring complex software solutions.
Startups already beginning to tackle this challenge include RideCell, which in early April raised $11.7 million from BMW and Khosla Ventures. Given its strategic positioning and its commitment to autonomous technology, it seems safe to assume that Uber will invest and compete vigorously here.
AV artificial intelligence / machine learning
The central technological breakthrough at the core of the entire AV concept is the vehicle’s ability to conduct advanced and adaptive decision-making itself based on all the data at its disposal. Artificial intelligence software enabling vehicles to “think” in this way is the most important and technically demanding AV technology category of all. A handful of companies are seeking to build such solutions.
Some of these companies focus solely on software; to go to market, they will look to partner with, or be acquired by, hardware manufacturers. One prominent example is nuTonomy, which recently announced a partnership with the Singapore government to deploy driverless taxis there by 2018. nuTonomy, an MIT spinout, raised $16 million in Series A funding in May.
Other companies are building machine-learning software integrated with hardware in order to offer a comprehensive autonomous system. Included in this group are auto manufacturers such as Tesla but also many promising startups. Cruise Automation, recently acquired by GM, is one well-known example.
Another noteworthy startup is George Hotz’s Comma.ai. Comma.ai is building aftermarket “kits” consisting of sensors, computers and software that allow customers to convert existing cars into AVs. The company aims to bring these kits to market for under $1,000 by the end of 2016.

Other startups tackling this ambitious challenge include Zoox, Peloton (focused specifically on long-haul trucking fleets) and Nauto, among many others currently in “stealth mode.”
Conclusion
The landscape of AV companies in these early days of the technology is fluid and fast-changing. Established auto manufacturers, large technology companies and scrappy start-ups are all fiercely competing to win in the AV ecosystem.
A wave of M&A activity, partnerships and consolidation seems likely as AVs move toward commercial availability. One thing is certain: There will be massive opportunity for profit as the autonomous vehicle market takes off in the coming years.
In the words of angel investor Tikhon Bernstam, one of Cruise’s earliest backers: “You’d be hard-pressed to lose money investing in this space right now because there is going to be tens or even hundreds of billions in M&A and IPOs going forward. Cruise at $1 billion may look very cheap one day.”

1097,Tesla’s weird week,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/10/teslas-weird-week/,2016/06/10,"
It’s been a weird few days for Tesla.
In a span of just 72 hours, the Model S was accused of having major suspension issues, the NHTSA supposedly got involved, Tesla explained there is nothing wrong and the NHTSA isn’t actually investigating the issue and Elon Musk tweeted that the whole thing was a giant conspiracy.
Woah. OK, let’s take a step back and dissect this.
Angry bloggers
On Wednesday, a car-focused blog posted a report that a Tesla in Pennsylvania was suffering from suspension issues.
It also detailed that Tesla owners with similarly affected cars were reportedly being asked to sign repair agreements with a confidentiality clause that potentially limited the drivers’ ability to report the defect to The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
And lastly, the post said that NHTSA investigators were “in contact with Tesla requesting more information on these parts and others in the suspension.”
The next day, a report broke saying that The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was investigating suspension problems in the model S.


BREAKING: Regulators examining reports of suspension problems in Tesla Model S – Reuters • https://t.co/B9PAne5SQt
— CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) June 9, 2016



Most of the time, when it’s announced that NHTSA regulators are investigating a safety feature in a company’s flagship car, shit hits the fan. And it did.
Within hours, major news publications were reporting that the NHTSA had begun investigating Tesla’s suspension problems, and were also concerned with strange non-disclosure wording in the customer goodwill repair agreement. The markets were also reacting, with the company’s stock trading down about 4 percent over the course of the day.
Thing’s weren’t looking bright for the electric car company, and the issues seem to have all stemmed from that single blog post.
Tesla strikes back
But then just hours later, Tesla released a blog post with their own version of the story. Titled “A Grain of Salt,” the blog post essentially shut down every angle of the issue, trying to prove that there wasn’t really an issue to begin with.
First, it explained there is “no safety defect with the suspensions in either the Model S or Model X.” Addressing the one car from the original blog post, it said that the suspension ball joint experienced very abnormal rust, something they have never see on another car. Tesla also threw some shade on the owner, saying “the car had over 70,000 miles on it and its owner lives down such a long dirt road that it required two tow trucks to retrieve the car.”
Next, it clarified the issue with the goodwill repair agreement, saying that it would “never ask a customer to sign a document to prevent them from talking to NHTSA or any other government agency.” The car company explained that the point of the document was to “ensure that Tesla doesn’t do a good deed, only to have that used against us in court for further gain.”
Got it. So Tesla basically is saying that all the mentioned issues were either false or over-exaggerated. But of course that wasn’t enough for the always feisty car company. In the last section of the post Tesla got personal, throwing shade on the original blogger that started this whole ordeal the day prior. I’ll post it below so you can read it in all its original glory.
Finally, it is worth noting that the blogger who fabricated this issue, which then caused negative and incorrect news to be written about Tesla by reputable institutions, is Edward Niedermeyer. This is the same gentle soul who previously wrote a blog titled “Tesla Death Watch,” which starting on May 19, 2008 was counting the days until Tesla’s death. It has now been 2,944 days. We just checked our pulse and, much to his chagrin, appear to be alive. It is probably wise to take Mr. Niedermeyer’s words with at least a small grain of salt.- The Tesla Team
OK. So Tesla has made it clear that there are probably no suspension issues, but what about the NHTSA?
Musk finishes the job
Just a few hours later, Musk took to Twitter to confirm that the NHTSA found no reasons for concern regarding the Model S suspension, and has no further need to collect information from Tesla on the matter.


NHTSA confirmed today that they found no safety concern with the Model S suspension and have no further need for data from us on this matter
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 10, 2016



Then, Musk said that about 90 percent of the suspension complaints to the NHTSA were fake — using a false location or VIN number. Weird. Could it be a conspiracy? Musk thinks so.


Would seem to indicate that one or more people sought to create the false impression of a safety issue where none existed. Q is why?
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 10, 2016



The whole things seems a little weird, and very confusing. Was there an isolated issue with one car suspension? It seems yes. Was there strange wording in the goodwill agreement that may have confused owners? It seems yes. But is the NHTSA actively investigating Tesla for manufacturing faulty suspensions and intentionally misleading customers with a nondisclosure agreement? No.
At the end of the day, the moral of the story is probably to listen to Tesla’s blog post title and just take everything with a grain of salt, until you can actually take time and figure out yourself what is actually going on. Oh, and don’t get in a fight with Elon Musk.

1099,What autonomous driving is — and isn’t — in 2016,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/09/what-autonomous-driving-is-and-isnt-in-2016/,2016/06/09,"
When Honda announced that its latest Civic sedan would have a full suite of state-of-the-art driver assist features for $20,000, The Wall Street Journal called it a self-driving vehicle. While the Civic can do a lot, it cannot drive itself. Yet. So what are we even talking about when we talk about autonomous or self-driving vehicles?
Lucky for us, engineers are on top of this. In January 2014, SAE International issued a standard defining exactly what we’re talking about. They gave us six levels, numbered 0-5, and a definition in plain, non-nerd language of what each level means. Here’s a breakdown:

0: No automation at all. The human does all the work, even if there are warnings that pop up, like a Check Engine light.
1: Driving assistance. The vehicle can assist with steering or speed in certain circumstances, but the human is still fully in charge of driving.
2: Partial automation. The vehicle can take over steering and speed altogether in certain circumstances, but the human is still fully in charge of driving.
3: Conditional automation. The vehicle steers, takes care of speed and monitors the road. The human is still required to take over when the system needs help.
4: High automation. The vehicle can pretty much do everything, even if the human driver does not respond when asked to by the system.
5: Full automation. The vehicle does absolutely everything a human driver could do.

Most of the new cars we’re seeing now, in 2016, have level 2 systems available. That includes things like lane keeping and adaptive cruise control — the car can do some steering and speed work, but the driver is still in complete control.
But the more advanced vehicles available have level 3 systems, which are more autonomous. “When you buy a car today, you have the steps toward autonomous driving,” said Paul Rivera, VP of Ricardo, an engineering consulting company, during a panel at the Faraday Future Long Beach ePrix in April. “There are about 35 things that make a car autonomous.”
Looking at the SAE standards, Chris Boroni-Bird of Qualcomm said during the same panel that features of fully autonomous vehicles will be entering the market very soon. Automatic emergency braking, for example, “is autonomous for a few split seconds.”
The goal is to have fully autonomous vehicles, like Google’s self-driving car, completely take over all driving tasks. Google’s test car doesn’t have a steering wheel or pedals; a human cannot take control even if they want to.
There are two basic ways to get to fully autonomous cars: jump in with both feet, which is Google’s strategy, and wade in slowly, which is the major manufacturers’ strategy. Jumping in with both feet requires a small fleet of specially built cars that must go through millions of miles of testing in controlled environments before they’re ready to sell to the public. Wading in means slowly adding to cars being sold proven autonomous technologies as they become available so you can sell cars while ramping up the automation factor.
With companies working both ends of this spectrum, vehicles will only get closer to full autonomy faster. We may not get the flying cars we were promised by science fiction decades ago, but who cares, since we’ll be able to read sci-fi while the car drives us to work.

1100,Uber and Fiat are in discussions to form a self-driving car partnership,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/08/fiatdreamsofselfdrivingcars/,2016/06/08,"
Uber and Fiat Chrysler are in talks about a partnership involving self-driving car technology, according to several reports.
Bloomberg first published earlier today about a possible deal between the two companies, confirmed by Wall Street Journal sources.
According to a person familiar with the matter, the discussions are in the very early stage and Uber is in conversation with a number of other carmakers. There’s always a chance the deal could fall apart. Uber declined to comment about the possible partnership at this time.
The deal seems part of a growing trend among automakers and tech companies focused on transportation and Uber has been chatting with several automakers lately, according to the reports.
But it’s not the first to strike a deal with an auto manufacturer. In fact, several Uber rivals have started to make a play in the self-driving space – Volkswagen invested $300 million in Gett, Apple, which is making its own self-driving car, invested a billion in China’s Didi Chuxing last month and Lyft announced a half-billion dollar investment from GM in early January to help create the infrastructure for a fleet of self-driving vehicles.
Many traditional car makers have started forging a path to a self-driving future. Volkswagen, as mentioned, as well as Daimler, BMW and now Fiat Chrysler want in on the autonomous tech race.
Fiat is the third-largest car maker in the U.S. and may be feeling left out of the game. A merger deal between GM and Fiat Chrysler fell apart last year, right before GM’s investment in Lyft and now the major car maker may be setting its sights on ride-hailing company Uber as a way in.
Uber is working on building a fleet of self-driving vehicles and poached a bunch of Carnegie Mellon roboticists last year to work on the project. Uber then financed the institution with $5.5 million as a way to make amends and create the Uber Advanced Technologies Center in Pittsburgh.

Uber also confirmed it had formed an auto-leasing deal with Toyota, which has become a major player in self-driving innovation, in May. According to a source close to the matter, Toyota and Uber are not planning on a partnership around self-driving technology.
Fiat is also making inroads with other tech firms in Silicon Valley around autonomous tech. Alphabet’s Google agreed to partner on building a fleet of 100 self-driving minivans in May.

1101,Is Formula E the future of racing?,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/07/is-formula-e-the-future-of-racing/,2016/06/07,"
There are only two races left in Formula E’s second season, making this as good a time as any to review whether electric racing is the future of motor sports. I tend to think it is the future, but there are some definite growing pains to be worked through.
Some good reasons for Formula E to be the future of racing:


It’s electric. Electric cars, along with hybrids, plug-in hybrids and even hydrogen fuel cell cars, are a growing segment of the market. Just witness the hundreds of thousands of people who plunked down deposits for a Tesla Model 3 within hours of its announcement. As Anthony Thompson of Qualcomm said in a press conference at the beginning of the Faraday Future Long Beach Formula E Grand Prix, “The stone age didn’t end because we ran out of rocks. We developed better technology.” Oil and internal combustion engines, in this analogy, are going the way of rocks and making way for electric motors.

It’s family friendly. The entire series, from practice to race, happens in one day. No overnights are required, and tickets are still pretty cheap — $25 for a whole day at the Long Beach event. There are support events all day long, so whenever the cars aren’t on the track, you can watch the race drivers compete against one another in a virtual race, or test drive an electric scooter, or eat hot dogs and drink beer like you would at any race. The cars are quiet, so little ones don’t need to wear protective headsets over their ears. I saw a family of at least three generations watching qualifying laps in the stands, all in race gear, even the infant laying on the bench with her attentive grandmother and the preschool boys who hooted at every car that passed.

It’s urban. More people are moving to urban areas worldwide, and Formula E insists that its events be held on city circuits, like Berlin and Buenos Aires. People in these cities and their suburbs can take public transit or rideshare cheaply; if they have electric cars, the race is probably well within range without a recharge. Rather than building it and waiting for them to come, Formula E wants to build it where the people already are or can get to with the lowest emissions possible.

It’s interactive. FanBoost gives fans the power to add power to their favorite driver’s car. The driver who receives the most votes via website or app gets a short burst of power to use at his or her discretion on the track during the race — enough to make a strategic pass.

Some reasons Formula E is not the race series of today:


Technical difficulties. Every driver has two cars. They deplete the batteries in the first one then pull into the pits about halfway through the race. They hop out of the nearly dead car and into one with fresh batteries to finish. Most Formula E drivers do this at roughly the same time, similar to how most teams in a NASCAR race will come in for gas within a lap or two of each other. At the 2016 Long Beach race, the feed to the giant screens went out, leaving the crowd with no information during the change. There were no cars on the track, and we couldn’t see what was happening in the pits. Also, it turned out that the feed shown to the spectators is the same feed used by the race announcer. If he couldn’t see the feed, he couldn’t give information either. He had to check the website to determine standings, which everyone was already doing on their phones in the stands.

Battery technology. The swap does add a new dimension of interest and excitement, if you can see it happening. But the fact that the drivers have to swap cars mid-race just shines a spotlight on the fact that batteries aren’t quite up to the task of racing yet. The goal is to prove that electric cars are fast and sexy and fun, which they are, but being able to race all-out for an hour on one charge seems like another reasonable goal. Formula E is probably working on this.

More differentiation, more competition. Formula E began with a fleet of identical cars in its inaugural season to help ease teams into this brave new world of electric Formula racing. In its second season, it allowed teams to develop their own drivetrains. In future seasons, teams will be able to make more changes and further differentiate the cars. That is when, we hope, the competition of the series will really shine. At the 2016 Long Beach race, the biggest battle was in the middle of the pack, for sixth and seventh place. Everybody loves a good battle on the track, but it’s nice when the first five places aren’t set in stone by the halfway point of the race.

Depending on who you talk to, the lack of roaring engines is either a plus or a minus. There are other pluses, like the design possibilities for a car that doesn’t need to exhaust any gases, and there are other minuses, like holdover rules from the FIA governing body that don’t apply to electric cars and frustrate officials. But the 2016-17 season is already a go, so things can only move forward from here.

1102,"China’s Bitauto raises $300M, with Baidu, JD.com and Tencent each chipping in $50M",https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/06/chinas-bitauto-raises-300m-with-baidu-jd-com-and-tencent-each-chipping-in-50m/,2016/06/06,"
As the on-demand transportation industry continues to heat up in China, one of the bigger online marketplaces for cars is also capitalizing on the growth.
Bitauto Holdings — which both operates a giant car marketplace that we’ve in the past described as Cars.com, Consumer Reports and Auto Trader rolled into one; and also invests in transportation startups — has announced a fundraise of $300 million. The company is traded publicly and is valued at around $1.4 billion; and this latest cash injection is partly notable because of who is making it.
Chinese search giant Baidu, WeChat owner Tencent and e-commerce portal JD.com are each taking investments of $50 million in Bitauto, which is also taking an additional $150 million from PA Grand Opportunity Limited.
Bitauto is not disclosing how it plans to use the money beyond “general corporate purposes.” The company currently makes revenues from advertising, subscriptions, transactions and marketing. Its financials and other metrics are as outsized as the wider economic growth in China: the company is profitable with revenues on the rise, and said that in the first quarter of this  year it generated 27 million sales leads and some 50,000 transactions.
JD.com and Tencent were previous strategic investors, while Baidu is taking its stake as part of a new strategic partnership, in which it sounds like Bitauto will provide inventory for a new auto search on Baidu.
“We are delighted to announce today the strengthening of our strategic partnership with JD.com and Tencent, and the establishment of a new partnership with Baidu, the leader in Chinese language online search,” said Bitauto’s CEO William Li in a statement. “We are also pleased to welcome PAG, a leading regional private investment firm, as an important investor. My personal participation in this transaction is a further testament to management’s strong confidence in Bitauto’s future development.”
While the growing interest both in autos and transportation services are signs of how China’s economy (and specifically its middle class) continues to grow, what’s also interesting is the place that Bitauto might play in the bigger global transportation game of chess.
Bitauto’s CFO was reportedly in talks with Uber last year for the U.S. transportation behemoth to take a stake in Chinese carpooling company Dida Pinche, as part of Uber’s bid to increase its footprint in the country to compete better against Didi Chuxing (formerly known as Didi Kuaidi). While Uber is the biggest and most highly valued of all the on-demand transportation startups, more localized startups like Didi, which itself is valued in the billions, are giving it a run for its money. So why would Bitauto’s CFO be talking to Uber? Because Bitauto is an investor in Dida Pinche, which itself has raised over $100 million.
And, on top of this connection, Baidu is now a common investor between both Bitauto and Uber. It will be interesting to see how and if (and why) there are more connections are made here with Uber in the wake of the Baidu connection between the two.
Back to today’s news, Bitauto says that under the agreement, Tencent, Baidu and JD.com are each purchasing 2,471,577 newly issued ordinary shares of Bitauto at US$20.23 per share, corresponding to US$20.23 per American depositary share of Bitauto (“ADS”).
The PAG investment, meanwhile, is coming in the form of convertible bonds that will be due in five years with an interest rate of 2.00% per annum.


At least some of the investment will be in the form of investing to service the strategic partnerships. Bitauto had already been using strategic investments to expand its footprint:
“Through our cooperation over the past year with JD.com and Tencent, China’s leaders in world-class e-commerce, social media and big data, we have gained tremendous momentum in making Bitauto the industry leader in online automobile transactions,” said Li in a statement. “Through our new partnership with Baidu, we expect to leverage its leadership in mobile and desktop online search, big data and transaction services platforms for additional strategic advantages as we continue to create the industry leading new and used car purchasing experience for customers in China.”

1103,Uber accused of wage stealing in new lawsuit from New York drivers,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/02/uber-accused-of-wage-stealing-in-new-lawsuit-from-new-york-drivers/,2016/06/02,"
The New York Taxi Workers Alliance (NYTWA) and 10 Uber drivers have filed a lawsuit against the company, accusing Uber of stealing wages.
The group representing 5,000 Uber drivers in New York filed the new claims today and says the rideshare giant unfairly skims driver wages without offering the added protections they’d get as employees.
The suit was filed in federal court in Manhattan and represents a total of 19,000 New York taxi, black car and Uber drivers. The group filed separately with the National Labor Relations Board, claiming Uber was illegally preventing drivers from bringing class action suits against the company.
This latest legal drama for Uber is just one of many suits the company now faces throughout the country over the classification of workers as independent contractors and is part of a larger issue facing the company worldwide with competition in Asia, India and legal battles in Europe and elsewhere.
It may also be cause to delay a much-anticipated IPO. CEO Travis Kalanick has repeatedly said Uber would not be going public any time soon and the company’s increasing troubles would be a reason to hold off on doing so.
Instead, Uber recently added a $3.5 billion investment from Saudi Arabia — its largest funding sum ever — to continue to fill its coffers.
Uber agreed to settle a suit over worker classification for hundreds of thousands of drivers in San Francisco in April and pay out up to $100 million to 385,000 drivers. The proposed terms would continue to allow Uber to classify drivers as independent contractors.
Angry Uber drivers showed up at San Francisco’s Federal District Court for a hearing today to protest the terms of the agreement.
Uber contends most drivers are not seeking full-time employment and are happy as independent workers, and told TechCrunch earlier today it believes the settlement agreement with drivers in San Francisco to be reasonable.
“Nearly 90 percent of drivers say the main reason they use Uber is because they love being their own boss,” Uber spokesperson Matt Wing said. “As employees, drivers would have set shifts, earn a fixed hourly wage, and lose the ability to drive with other ridesharing apps — as well as the personal flexibility they most value.”
There are at least eight other claims pending in other states over the classification of Uber drivers. Uber rival Lyft has also faced legal issues over classification of its drivers as independent contractors.

1104,Wype will come clean your car where it sits,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/02/wype-will-come-clean-your-car-in-situ/,2016/06/02,"
Recently, I wrote about Wyper, the Tinder of car shopping. That prompted Andy Kim, co-founder of Wype, to contact me. His business is one letter off from Wyper, after all, so in the interest of disambiguation, here’s the scoop on the car-detailing company that is more like Uber than Tinder in the app comparison game.
Wype is based in Southern California, where cars are shiny and water is scarce. Wype detailers arrive at your car armed with non-toxic, plant-based proprietary cleaning products that require no additional water — no hoses, no puddles. According to Kim, the car wash industry wastes 300 million gallons of water, or 38 gallons per car, each day. (Auto Laundry News estimates that car washes use between 35 and 120 gallons per vehicle, depending on wash type.)
Wype was founded in 2014 in Orange County by Kim, Kevin Dawson and former LA Laker Jordan Farmar (who’s currently with the Memphis Grizzlies). Most customers are not pro basketball players, though; they’re males with above-average income and soccer-mom types, all between the ages of 24 and 40. Interestingly, the men tend to call for their cars to be cleaned on weekends, while three-quarters of women request a car detail on weekdays.
No matter the demographic, there are three levels of Wype: the Quickie, which only cleans the exterior and doesn’t require you to give the keys to the detailer; the Standard, which gets the interior and exterior clean; and the Swanky, which adds wax. When they clean the interior, they’ll take out the trash, organize your stuff that isn’t trash and leave you a mint. They also take before and after pictures.
Kim said in an email that no car has yet been too dirty for Wype to handle. “Our process safely and effectively cleans surfaces that haven’t been washed for months,” he wrote. “Now, we’re also lucky that there aren’t too many off-roaders in the areas we service.” So that Jeep in the picture may be a challenge.
Wype’s service area is still small, and the mobile web version will roll out in the next couple of weeks. (The iOS app is out there already; there is not an Android app.)
So to recap: Wype will clean your car. Wyper will help you shop for a car. The URLs for Wipe.com and Wiper.com, as far as I can tell, are up for grabs.

The Bulwer-Lytton fiction contest is a yearly competition in which writers attempt to create the worst possible opening sentence to a novel. Google, for several reasons, should enter this year — in its latest self-driving car project report (PDF), the company writes: “As our honking algorithms improved, we’ve begun broadcasting our car horn to the world.”
Aside from the absurdity of that sentence (which surely is unique in the history of sentences), the news really is interesting. Google has, apparently, been testing the application of the horn for some time now as a means to alerting other drivers of the car’s presence — but only played it inside the cabin. This way, human evaluators could rate whether the “honking algorithm” was on target or not.

Having reached some internally accepted level of competency, the cars are now allowed to use the horn in two ways. If it’s imminent danger, such as someone veering into the car’s lane going the other direction, a traditional blast of the horn will be employed. But if, for example, someone is obliviously backing up toward the car in a parking lot, “we might sound two short, quieter pips,” the report reads.
Beyond the honks and “pips,” the cars will also now emit a humming noise designed to make pedestrians, especially those with impaired sight, aware of the car. This is a challenge faced by many electric cars, and manufacturers have tested many solutions, from simulated engine noise to a UFO-like warble. Google’s description of the vehicle’s hum suggests it leans more towards the former, though in the interest of “personality,” a little something extra has been added, which the document fails to detail. Perhaps one of our readers lucky enough to encounter a Google car in the wild can furnish a first-hand report.
The recurring accident enumeration portion of the Google report is thin: only one accident, in manual mode, in which the car hit the median at a blistering 9 MPH.

Don’t Mortgage Your Startup





With Tesla’s growing popularity, Uber’s continued global expansion, incessant rumors of Apple’s entry into transit, the ascent of drones, Google’s exploration of self-driving cars and the billion-dollar sale of Cruise Automation to GM, the transport sector has never looked hotter for aspiring entrepreneurs. It’s a market that is measured in trillions, is filled with companies that have a pre-historic approach to software and has a seemingly unbreakable commitment to fuel sources made from dinosaurs.
As that fleet of entrepreneurs direct their attention to this field, I’d like to caution them to think outside the gearbox.
There’s a strong tendency to over-index on one’s own experience. Most entrepreneurs are young urbanites and have felt the pain of trying to hail a cab, so Uber makes sense. This is why we’ve seen more than 100 companies try to tackle the urban transport market in nearly every possible permutation. Likewise, there’s a lot of appeal to following in the footsteps of Henry Ford and Elon Musk and building a consumer transportation brand from scratch.
By all means, if you’re a robotic fanatic with a billion-dollar exit under your belt, like Kyle Vogt, feel free to take on the challenge of building the next self-driving car. If you genuinely think you have the ability to marshal huge sums of capital and lobby the government for loans like Elon Musk, building a new car brand from scratch makes sense.
Despite a small number of entrepreneurs with those characteristics, almost all the focus on transportation startups has to do with the wings, wheels and rotors that propel the core technology. Imagine if everyone kept trying to build the next Cisco or NVIDIA when Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google had yet to be built. This leads people to miss the second order effects that might be even larger. Benedict Evans noted this last year:


Posit: self-driving cars will create as many millionaires in real estate and retail as in tech
— Benedict Evans (@BenedictEvans) December 15, 2015



I totally agree that smart entrepreneurs without specific domain expertise in auto tech should avoid tangling with Tesla and instead consider addressing adjacent businesses, cultural shifts and other societal changes that will occur when electric, self-driving, software-powered cars become mainstream over the next 5-10 years.
It can be hard to imagine what idiosyncratic startup opportunities will be available in the future, but it’s worthwhile to take a look back at the oddball businesses that emerged from the disruption caused by automobiles in the 20th century.
Six odd “auto-powered” startups
Drive-through windows
Interstates and suburbanization enabled by automobiles have transformed retail. Take the humble drive-through window, a fixture of suburban life and the butt of jokes for foodies — yet it is also responsible for up to 70 percent of McDonald’s $25 billion in revenue. Americans make more than 12 billion stops at drive-through restaurants, banks, pharmacies, mailboxes and even wedding chapels each year.
NASCAR
Auto racing is a $13 billion business worldwide. The sport, especially elite levels like Formula One, began as an outlet for wealthy auto enthusiasts and auto manufacturers, but it’s managed to permeate all strata of culture. NASCAR, a $3 billion business unto itself, started like many startups — in a garage. Would-be racers without the means to compete at the elite levels set up a system where they could race stock cars, a homebrew alternative to the Apple-esqe F1 circuit. We’ve already seen the rise of two drone racing leagues — it’s not hard to imagine computer-assisted Indy cars in the offing.
Walmart
Fortunes have been made on the back of freight transport since the Roman Empire and Silk Road, yet the most recent example of the trend is based in Bentonville, Arkansas. Long-haul trucking made it possible for Sam Walton to thoroughly dominate retail in regions that were not well-served by rail, and allowed the company to grow to the point where it now has a $219 billion market cap.
Holiday Inn
We’re living through a massive transformation that creates opportunities in so many ways.
The birth of the interstate highway system allowed people to criss-cross the country and created demand for hotels that would offer uniform service. Holiday Inn was the first of what would become a series of chains, and today offers road-weary travelers 3,000 locations, provides shelter for 100 million guests per year and generates more than $1.8 billion in annual revenue.
Levittown
Perhaps the most important influence of cars has been the birth of the suburbs. An entrepreneur name Abraham Levitt started the trend in the 1940s with his eponymous project Levittown. Seventy years later, national homebuilders like Pulte and Toll Brothers have turned suburban home building into major business, but this fateful development led to even more profound changes.
Prior to the wide availability of cars, Americans lived in densely packed urban centers. Today, according to the U.S. Census, more than 81 percent of Americans describe where they live as suburban. With existing semi-autonomous cars already clearly pointing the way to self-driving cars, it’s not crazy to see a mass bifurcation where people choose to either live in expensive city centers or move even farther out of urban cores in the knowledge that they’ll be able to work or relax en route.
Home Depot
Shopping malls are a natural outgrowth of suburbs, but big box stores, or category killers as they’re sometimes called, are even more impressive. Home Depot and Lowe’s combined sell more than $150 billion worth of merchandise every year. (To put that in perspective, that’s about $40 billion more than Amazon.) These businesses would not be possible if there were not millions of suburban homes that need tending and, more importantly, a fleet of privately owned pickup trucks that allow individual customers to transport the bulky and heavy merchandise.
Respect second order effects
None of these businesses thrive by selling automobiles, or services for them. Instead, they are reactions to a world where cars are common. There will be a similar reinvention based on emerging transportation technologies. For instance, we already see drive-through windows losing some traction because of the rise of mobile ordering.
A change in transportation will be an engine for entrepreneurship.
Also consider there’s a wide world of planes, ships, trains, drones and yet to be invented forms of transit that will similarly reshape our landscape. Container ships are an innovation that have been compared to the microchip in terms of their influence, yet only Haven seems to be chasing this opportunity. Urban CCTV surveillance manufacturers have surged in the wake of awful terror acts — what happens to them when four drones can be dispatched to “squat” on a ledge in low-energy mode focused on a building’s entrance?
Clearly the list above is by no means exhaustive — suburbanization and the rise of retail that accompanied it have changed our economy and society in ways that are hard to fully comprehend. The forthcoming change is equally hard to forecast. The simple point is that we’re living through a massive transformation that creates opportunities in so many ways.
Ray Kroc, Abraham Levitt and Arthur Blank were all arguably more successful “auto entrepreneurs” than Preston Tucker and John DeLorean. A change in transportation will be an engine for entrepreneurship, but it will not be confined to companies that are building motors. Those that are able to correctly identify and execute on this era’s second order opportunities will surely be just as well-rewarded.

1107,Uber takes its most significant investment yet at $3.5 billion from Saudi Arabia,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/01/uber-takes-its-most-significant-investment-yet-at-3-5-billion-from-saudi-arabia/,2016/06/01,"
Uber announced today it took $3.5 billion from Public Investment Fund (PIF), Saudi Arabia’s main investment fund as part of its latest round.
The new investment is the largest to date for the ridesharing giant and brings the total balance of both cash and debt to more than $11 billion but doesn’t increase the company’s current $62.5 billion value.
Uber rules the U.S. market as the dominant ridesharing service and continues to forge ahead on global expansion and the Middle East is a key area in the company’s future.
Uber also operates in surrounding Middle Eastern countries such as Egypt and the United Arab Emirates and partners with those country’s government entities to hire and educate drivers. According to the company, there are more than 395,000 active riders in the region.
“We appreciate the vote of confidence in our business as we continue to expand our global presence,” Uber founder Travis Kalanick said in a statement. “Our experience in Saudi Arabia is a great example of how Uber can benefit riders, drivers, and cities and we look forward to partnering to support their economic and social reforms.”
According to the company, the investment aligns with Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia’s recently announced plans to reduce dependence on oil and oil-related industries.
“This ambitious and far-reaching plan presents a number of goals, including unlocking strategic sectors such as tourism and entertainment, boosting employment opportunities and women’s participation in the workforce, and encouraging entrepreneurship,” PIF’s Yasir Al Ruymayyan said in a statement.

 However, the country has been criticized for not allowing women to drive and transportation is a huge problem for that half of the population. Saudi Arabia believes Uber offers a solution by supplying on-demand rides for women – Uber has been operating in the country since 2014 and says about 80 percent of all riders are female.

1108,The trends driving electric vehicle development,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/01/rise-of-the-electric-vehicle/,2016/06/01,"




Ion Yadigaroglu
Contributor


Ion Yadigaroglu is the managing principal of Capricorn Investment Group.


In case you weren’t paying attention, something amazing just happened to the automobile industry.
The recent unveiling of Tesla’s Model 3 resulted in the largest product pre-order in history. The fact that within days of launch about 400,000 people paid $1,000 each for a car they will receive in 2018 is simply astounding. In addition to the $400 million wired to Tesla, this represents an order book of more than $15 billion dollars.
There’s more. Three technology trends are converging in automobile transportation — and not a minute too soon, given the giant emissions and human carnage wrought by conventional vehicles:

In my view, Tesla has demonstrated that electric vehicles can result in a superior automotive product in terms of driving performance, safety, comfort and even convenience.
On-demand and ridesharing services shifted billions of car miles (including more than 1.5 billion miles on Uber alone) to their offering and made the case that ownership is an unnecessary and perhaps even negative part of the car experience.
Finally, autonomous driving is captivating everyone’s imagination in how it can both address safety in a more fundamental way and offer the next level of convenience (in addition to life-changing benefits to groups such as the blind and disabled).


These three big technological themes have accelerated over the past decade, and they are now showing multiplier effects on each other. This convergence is leading to dozens of new startups.  The traditional automakers are deploying large resources in this space, and now Tesla, Uber, Apple and Google — some of the most dynamic and successful technology companies in the world — are showing up in the driver’s seat of a new frontier.
Battery technology is at the core of what is needed to further drive electric vehicle adoption. The issue is mainly lowering the cost of batteries, with performance already adequate for most applications. The cost of a kilowatt of lithium-ion storage has dropped from about $1,000 in 2008 to something like $200 today. There are numerous advanced technologies that promise costs of $100 and less in the years ahead. The scale-up of global battery capacity will require very large investments, in the tens of billions of dollars, which are only just beginning. The race for those future plants remains open, and we see it as a highly dynamic and exciting area of investment.
On the ridesharing front, dozens of business models are addressing the absurd inefficiency of the current ownership model — where cars are left unused, on average, 23 hours of every day. By significantly increasing the utilization rate of vehicles, companies like Uber, Lyft, Kuaidi Dache, Ola and others are reducing the number of cars on the road. This has a direct positive environmental impact, by reducing congestion-related pollution and the need for additional road infrastructure, which will be multiplied with the roll-out of zero-emission electric vehicles. 
Automation is perhaps the most captivating and science-fiction-like development. Self-driving cars are already a reality. The challenge is how to manage the roll-out in terms of regulation and infrastructure. The inevitable coexistence, at least initially, of self-driving vehicles with their human-operated counterparts will certainly pose quandaries.
Significantly less prone to accidents than human operators, self-driving vehicles allow us to imagine transportation without the associated carnage on the world’s roads. More than 1 million people were killed globally in vehicle crashes last year. An incredible boost to economic productivity and leisure can also be foreseen with millions of hours of commuting time becoming available for whatever we choose to do with them.

Finally, the positive environmental impact is potentially the biggest win of these technological shifts. Sustainable transportation, enabled and supported by the deployment of renewable electricity infrastructure, will make a significant dent in global carbon emissions.
Roughly three hundred billion dollars were invested in wind and solar power plants last year, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. That makes renewable infrastructure one of the largest capital expenditures globally. I think a similar big bang will soon occur in transportation with the race for better batteries. 
Many companies are already embracing the inherent opportunities of large-scale change. Others that don’t fully embrace the powerful forces at play will likely be challenged the way coal firms and cheating car companies are stumbling today.

1109,Why gaze tracking startup Cogisen is eyeing the Internet of Things,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/01/why-gaze-tracking-startup-cogisen-is-eyeing-the-internet-of-things/,2016/06/01,"
How will you interact with the Internet of Things in your smart home of the future? Perhaps by looking your connected air conditioning unit in the lens from the comfort of your sofa and fanning your face with your hand to tell it to crank up its cooling jets.
At least that’s the vision of Italian startup Cogisen, which is hoping to help drive a new generation of richer interface technology that will combine different forms of interaction, such as voice commands and gestures, all made less error prone and/or abstract by adding “eye contact” into the mix. (If no less creepy… Look into the machine and the machine looks into you, right?)
The startup has built an image processing platform, called Sencogi, which has a first focus on gaze-tracking — with plenty of potential being glimpsed by the team beyond that, whether it’s helping to power vision systems for autonomous vehicles by detecting pedestrians, or performing other specific object-tracking tasks for niche applications as industry needs demand.
But it’s starting with tracking the minuscule movements of the human iris as a basis for a new generation of consumer technology interfaces. Although it remains to be seen whether the consumers of the future will be won over to a world where they are expected to make eye contact with their gadgetry in order to control it, rather than comfort-mashing keys on a physical remote control.
“Voice control, voice recognition, works really, really well — it’s getting more and more robust… But interfaces certainly become a lot more natural if you start combining gaze tracking with voice control and gesture recognition,” argues Cogisen CEO and founder Christiaan Rijnders. “[Human interactions] are with the eyes and speech and gestures so that should be the future interaction that we have with our devices in the Internet of Things.”
“We are not saying gaze tracking will substitute other interfaces — absolutely not. But integrating them with all the different interfaces that we have will make interactions more natural,” he adds.
The startup has been developing its gaze tracking algorithms since 2009, including three years of bootstrapping prior to pulling in VC funding. It has just now attracted a bridge funding round from the EU, under the latter’s Horizon 2020 SME Phase II Funding program, which aims to support startups at the stage when they are still developing their tech to prime it to bring to market.
Rijnders claims Cogisen’s gaze tracking algorithms are proven at this point, after more than five years of R&D, although he concedes the technology itself is not yet proven — with the risk of eye-tracking interfaces being perceived by tech users as gimmicky. i.e. “a solution looking for a problem” (if you’ll pardon the pun). That’s why its next steps now with this new EU financing are exactly to work on making a robust case for why gaze tracking could be really useful.
For the record, he discounts an earlier-to-market consumer application of eye tracking in Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone as “not eye tracking,” “not 100 percent robust” and “quite gimmicky.” Safe to say it did not prove a massive hit with smartphone users…

“There’s a legacy that we have to live with which is that things were — especially a few years ago — rushed onto the market,” he says. “So now you have to fight the perception that it has already been on smartphones… and people didn’t like it… So the market is now very careful before they bring out something else.”
Cogisen is getting €2 million under the EU program, which it will use to develop some sample applications to try to convince industry otherwise — and ultimately to get them to buy in and license its algorithms down the line.
Although he also says it’s push from industry that is driving eye tracking R&D, adding, “It’s industry coming to us asking if we have the solution.”
The greatest push for eye tracking is coming from Internet of Things device makers, according to Rijnders — which makes plenty of sense when you consider one problem with having lots and lots of connected devices ranged around you is how to control them all without it becoming far more irritating and time-consuming than just twiddling a few dumb switches and dials.
So IoT is one of the three verticals Cogisen will focus on for its proof of concept apps — the other two being automotive and smartphones.
He says it’s positioning itself to address the general consumer segment versus other eye-tracking startups that he argues are more focused on building for B2B or targeting very specific use-cases, including that most creepy-of-all gaze tracking goal: advertising.
“The algorithms are proven. The technology itself and the applications still has to be proven. It has to be proven that you are willing to put your remote control in the bin and interact with your air conditioning unit combining voice control and gaze tracking,” he adds.
He names the likes of Tobii, Umoove, SMI and Eye Tribe as competitors, but, unlike these rivals, Cogisen is not relying on infrared or additional hardware for its eye-tracking tech, which means it can be applied to standard smartphone cameras (for example), without any need for especially high-res camera kit either.
He also says its eye-tracking algorithms can work at a greater range than infrared eye-trackers — currently “up to about three to four meters.”
Another advantage he mentions versus infrared-based technologies is the technology not requiring any calibration — which he says offers a clear benefit for automotive applications, given that no one wants to have to calibrate their car before they can drive off.
Eye tracking (should it live up to its accuracy claims) also holds more obvious potential than face-tracking, given the granular insights you’re going to glean based on knowing specifically where someone is looking, not just how they have oriented their face.
It’s easy for a car to decide to take away control from you — but it’s very hard for the car to decide when to give you back control.
“Vehicles will never be 100 percent autonomous. They’ll be decreased degrees of autonomy. It’s easy for a car to decide to take away control from you — but it’s very hard for the car to decide when to give you back control. For that they need to understand your attention, so you need gaze tracking,” adds Rijnders, discussing one potential use-case in the automotive domain.
When it comes to the accuracy, he says that’s dependent on the application in question and training the algorithms to work robustly for that use-case. But to do that, Cogisen’s image processing tech is being combined with machine learning algorithms and a whole training “toolchain” in order to yield the claimed robustness — automating optimizations based on the application in question.
So what exactly is the core tech here? What’s the secret image processing sauce? It’s down to using the frequency domain to identify complex shapes and patterns within an image, says Rijnders.
“What our core technology can do is recognize shapes and patterns and movements, purely in the frequency domain. The frequency domain is used a lot of course in image processing but it’s used as a filter — there’s nobody, until now, who has really been able to recognize complex shapes purely within the frequency domain data.
“And the frequency domain is inherently more robust, is inherently easy to use, is inherently faster to calculate with — and with this ability suddenly you have the ability to recognize much more complex patterns.”
Timeframe wise, he reckons there could be a commercial application of the gaze-tracking tech in the market in around two to three years from now. Although Cogisen’s demo apps — one in each vertical, chosen after market analysis — will be done in a year, per the EU program requirements.
Rijnders notes the current stage of the tech development means it’s facing a classic startup problem of needing to show market traction before being able to take in another (bigger) tranche of VC funding — hence applying for the EU grant to bridge this gap. Prior to taking in the EU funding, it had raised €3 million in VC funding from three Italian investor funds (Vertis, Atlante and Quadrivio).
Rijnders’ background is in aerospace engineering. He previously worked for Ferrari developing simulators for Formula 1, which is where he says the germ of the idea to approach the hard problem of image processing from another angle occurred to him.
“There you have to do very non-linear, transient, dynamic multi-physics modeling, so very, very complex modeling, and I realized what the next generation of algorithms would need to be able to do for engineering. And at a certain point I realized that there was a need in image processing for such algorithms,” he says, of his time at Ferrari.
“If you think about the infinity of light conditions and different types of faces and points of view relative to the camera and camera quality for following sub-pixel movement of the irises — very, very difficult image processing problem to solve… We can basically detect signal signatures in image processing which are far more sparse and far more difficult than what has been possible up to now in the state of the art of image processing.”

1111,"With its new wireless ecosystem, Mophie wants to remove cords from your life",https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/31/mophie-wireless-ecosystem/,2016/05/31,"
More often than not, mobile devices are a permanent dash from power socket to power socket. Mophie is the #1 brand in extending your range between charges, and with the launch of “Charge Force”, the brand wants to remove incessant plugging and unplugging from your life, too, with a brand new wireless ecosystem.
The system is pretty straightforward. Dress your phone in a fetching little electronic tuxedo in the form of a Mophie Juice Pack battery case and you’re good to go. The case includes wireless charging technology, enabling you to just plonk your phone down on a charger pad, and it’ll merrily charge away.
The charging pad and battery case kit costs $99. And, on closer inspection, maybe I should have given the phone a quick wipe before taking photos. Don’t use the fingerprints to steal my identity, please.
The system uses “preferential charging”, which charges the phone first (that’s where you’ll need the power the most, after all), before topping off your Juice Pack.
The ecosystem is more than just a pad that lives next to your desk, however. For your home or office, you can purchase a desk mounts with powerful magnets in it; it keeps the phone securely mounted, and you can use it while it’s charging, or pick it up and walk off with it to make a call or run off to lunch.
More interestingly, even, is the vent-mounted car charger pad. It both holds your phone firmly in place and charges it at the same time. Of course, you still need to plug it into a cigarette lighter or a USB port in your car, but the advantage with having the charging pad permanently installed is that you can tuck away the wires out of sight. That has a safety bonus, too: The cables don’t end up getting entangled in your gear stick, and it’s possible that car thieves are less likely to break in to steal a permanently installed thing. Maybe.
Mounting the charging pad in a car, you can connect your Juice Pack-wearing phone to a car vent using the built-in magnets, making it very quick to put your phone on charge as you’re on the go.
Starting today, Mophie is shipping out all of its battery cases with wireless charging built-in, at no extra cost compared to the old price tag. The company is eating the extra cost for the additional technology in the cases, and the hope is that once you’ve installed a charging pad next to your bed, on your desk in the office, at home next to the television and in your car, you’ll keep coming back for new charger cases whenever you upgrade your phone. 
For a fun little surprise for people who bought Mophie Juice Packs for the recently launched Samsung phones; your case already has all the tech wizardry built in to be able to use wireless charging. Sneaky, eh?
For the wireless charging geeks among you: The charging pads are Qi pads running at about 1 amp of charging power, so you shouldn’t see a huge drop the charging speed you’re used to with your cables — but the Juice Packs support both Qi and PMA standards, so if you find yourself in a bar, restaurant, or hotel that has wireless charging pads installed, you can drop your phone on one of them and giving your phone’s battery a much-needed spoonful of electronic love.
The kits retail at $99 and are available from Mophie, Apple and Best Buy, with Apple retail stores and Best Buy stores following in a few weeks.

1112,Intel buys computer vision startup Itseez to improve navigation in self-driving cars,https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/26/intel-buys-computer-vision-startup-itseez-to-improve-navigation-in-self-driving-cars/,2016/05/26,"
Intel has acquired computer vision and machine learning startup Itseez to develop better navigation for self-driving cars. The value of the deal was undisclosed.
Founded in 2005 and based in San Francisco, Itseez makes computer vision algorithms and software. The company’s products include a suite of algorithms for automobiles it calls “advanced driver assistance systems,” which allows car hardware to recognize pedestrians and traffic signs and warn about potential collisions.
The acquisition of Itseez comes one month Intel announced the purchase of Yogitech, another Internet of Things-related company. Based in Italy, Yogitech works on functional safety for semiconductors (which means its tech makes sure the chips powering autonomous vehicles are working properly).
Last year it also bought Lantiq, which makes chips for smart objects. Intel already makes chips, software, and a development kit for self-driving cars.
In Intel’s announcement, Doug Davis, Intel senior vice president and general manager of its Internet of Things Group (IOTG), said, “Itseez will become a key ingredient for Intel’s Internet of Things Group roadmap, and will help Intel’s customers create innovative deep-learning-based [computer vision] applications like autonomous driving, digital security and surveillance, and industrial application.”
Itseez has also developed algorithms for robotics, surveillance, smartphones, and sports analytics.
The acquisition is part of Intel’s strategic shift, which it announced last month, from PC chip maker to cloud computing, the Internet of Things, and analyzing data from those devices. Intel says its data center and Internet of Things businesses, which make up 40 percent of its total revenue, are already its “primary growth engines,” and have helped it weather a decline in the PC market by creating a total of $2.2 billion in revenue growth last year.
But the restructuring has already come at a huge cost—Intel is laying off 12,000 employees, or 11 percent of its workforce. Intel CEO Brian Crzanich said the job cuts are part of Intel’s “restructuring to accelerate its transformation.”

Craig Buschmann is an intellectual property attorney at Brinks Gilson & Lione.


What makes Tesla unique? How about everything. Mention patents to most people and their eyes glaze over. Worse, they think of patent “trolls” that some say are harming American businesses. But everyone appreciates one fundamental fact: Patents, and intellectual property generally, mean value.
Tesla began accepting orders on March 31 for its Model 3 electric vehicle at around $35,000. But unlike companies that jealousy guard their patents and intellectual property, Tesla’s  giving away its patents for free.
Why? It has a lot to do with how the company imagines its future markets — and how it manages its world-famous brand.
Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk famously announced not two years ago, “All Our Patent Are Belong To You.” (The sentence is an inside joke for coders and video game mavens: Musk’s seemingly unusual grammar refers to a well-known Internet meme, “All Your Base Are Belong to Us,” a mistranslation of a Japanese phrase in the early 1990s video game Zero Wing.)
Musk said Tesla would “not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use our technology.” In doing so, Tesla created a limited, open-source patent pool for the technologies used to build its electric vehicles (EVs) — including for vehicle components, battery charging, energy storage and power optimization.
Why give its patents away? To build the size of the market, and its own share of it. Tesla’s vision is an electric-powered future for automobiles and sophisticated energy storage systems, so the company must change a culture accustomed to internal combustion engines, and it must revolutionize the nation’s fuel delivery infrastructure.
As more people buy EVs, demand for a charging infrastructure increases. As the number of charging stations increases, it’s easier for potential buyers to rationalize a purchase. Not to mention that each charging location becomes another powerful advertisement of the Tesla brand, and a showroom for its vehicles.
The cultural and network effects reinforce each other in a positive feedback loop. And that moves Tesla toward its goal: selling all-electric vehicles to an increasingly larger group of buyers — buyers confident they’ll have access to power wherever they need it.
As the pie grows, everyone gets a larger slice.
Tesla’s not even the first automotive manufacturer to build and sell an EV. But that brings it back to brand.
Consider: What name leaps to mind when thinking about an electric car? How many people think Tesla first, and any one of the Nissan Leaf, BMW i3 or Chevy Bolt second?
Tesla’s Model 3 is an EV priced to put all-electric transportation within reach of middle-class buyers, with the cachet of a market-leading brand renowned for innovation. A lower-cost entry point — like Apple’s recently announced price cut for the Apple Watch, and its new, smaller iPhone — can increase market share by driving wider adoption.
By making its patents available for free, Tesla empowers others to build electric vehicles. More cars come along and the grid gets bigger. As the pie grows, everyone gets a larger slice.
Why don’t other automakers do the same thing? Simple: Established auto manufacturers have focused only intermittently on the EV market. More recently, Toyota, Ford and GM have focused on alternative fuel technologies like hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) or other partially electrified vehicles.
Established automakers can afford to adapt to new market opportunities over time. Tesla, as many investors know already, is burning cash and has yet to turn a profit. Its very survival is at stake.
Truth be told, Toyota and Ford do license their alternative fuel technology patents: Toyota for its hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs) and Ford for its HEVs. But they have different approaches to doing so.
Toyota is offering its powertrain technology patents royalty-free through 2020; royalty-free access to its hydrogen production and supply patents as yet never expires. The company is less reliant on other market players to assist in setting a standard for FCVs, so it needn’t rely on others to help establish a market for them. But like Tesla, Toyota will benefit from a larger fueling network, so it’s reducing the cost to others who are interested in adding to the number of hydrogen fueling stations.

The future of the car is not about propulsion

Ford’s approach to licensing is more traditional. Some of its patents for HEV technology are available for a fee. But Ford doesn’t need a tool to help create the conditions necessary for the relatively more mature technology, which has been mass-marketed for nearly 20 years, to succeed. It can afford to view its patent pool as a potential new source of revenue.
Tesla wins by using its patent pool to establish industry standards for EVs. Unique in the marketplace, Tesla wins for the brand by doing what Elon Musk famously does all the time: going against the grain. Building markets, bolstering the public’s view of the brand, staying famous, all the time, for everything it does.
Technology innovators have much to learn from Tesla’s example. And whose eyes would glaze over when the topic of patents has to do with revolutionizing how the entire world travels?

1114,Wyper fancies itself the Tinder of car shopping,https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/26/wyper-fancies-itself-the-tinder-of-car-shopping/,2016/05/26,"
The new iOS and Android app Wyper brings the swipe left-swipe right matchmaking magic of Tinder to car shopping. When I spoke with creator Aaron Rosenthal, the app had only been out of beta and available nationwide for about a week and a half, and there had already been more than 100,000 swipes. “We had the ‘Tinder for cars’ part done a year ago,” Rosenthal said, “but we had to do better than competition.”
Wyper pulls from new and used dealership inventories to show you cars that match your search criteria. Then, just like Tinder, you swipe left when you see a car you’re not into and swipe right when you’d like to hook up with that hatchback. But that’s pretty much the only similarity.
“It’s not just swipeability that makes it powerful,” said Rosenthal. “There are really powerful analytics a click a way.” Wyper uses an algorithm to learn what you’re interested in beyond your search criteria, which includes price, model, and body type. The more you swipe, the more Wyper learns what you like and what you don’t. You can also swipe down to further identify what you don’t like, whether that’s convertibles or manual transmissions. Then Wyper will stop showing you cars you’re not going to be interested in. It also uses swiping data from all users to aggregate cars with “social value”—things like popular trim levels and colors.
When you do find a car you’d like to check out, you can call the dealer or seller through the app, which masks your identity and uses the Wyper 800 number to call anonymously. This cuts down on the creep factor, sure, but anyone who has ever contacted a dealership and then been inundated with calls and emails will appreciate the middleman.
Wyper’s focus is entirely on the consumer, Rosenthal said. “AutoTrader and Cars.com focus on the dealer first,” he noted. Unlike most car buying apps, Wyper promises not to allow dealers to pay to put their listings first. But they’re also not going to charge for the app. “The best benefit is giving the users as many tools as possible for free and building a communication net for dealers and consumers.” He plans on building revenue via that communication—”Chat, voice, however we allow users to communicate”—and charging dealers for the privilege of connecting with potential buyers.
That connection is increasingly farther from home, according to Rosenthal. Though the app favors local results, as you keep searching, it can spiral outward to allow you to search nationwide if you want. That way, you can find a car with the perfect custom rims four states away, or a car that’s so much cheaper in another market that it’s worth a few hundred bucks to ship it to your location.
“We want you to find the perfect car that you want,” Rosenthal said. “Don’t settle.”

Rideshare wars just got even more interesting. Uber has confirmed a strategic investment and auto leasing deal from Toyota.
“Toyota is a global leader in the automotive industry and Toyota vehicles are among the most popular cars on the Uber platform worldwide,” Uber said in a statement to TechCrunch. “We are proud to partner with Toyota in a variety of ways, including the expansion of our vehicle financing program.”
Uber would not disclose terms of the deal or the financing program and there aren’t many details yet, but according to a release from the car manufacturer, Toyota is interested in exploring the future of transportation with Uber and the companies have “entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to explore collaboration, starting with trials, in the world of ridesharing in countries where ridesharing is expanding, taking various factors into account such as regulations, business conditions, and customer needs.”
The Toyota leasing deal helps Uber expand its financing program for Uber drivers, Uber Xchange, but will also bolster Uber’s moves into a self-driving vehicle future.
Though self-driving didn’t get a mention, a slew of major car manufacturers and tech companies have started investing in rideshare services and Toyota is a big player in self-driving innovation.
The car manufacturer announced last November it was putting forth $1 billion for the creation of the Toyota Research Institute, which is a new company established to develop AI and robotics for self-driving capabilities.
Note GM invested half a billion dollars in Uber rival Lyft earlier this year, with plans to work with the ridesharing company on self-driving innovation, as well.
Also, Volkswagen confirmed a $300 million deal with the New York-based ridesharing startup Gett this morning and Apple, which is rumored to be building its own self-driving vehicles, added a $1 billion investment to the recently renamed Chinese rideshare service Didi Chuxing earlier in May.

1116,ChargePoint raises $50 million to charge more cars,https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/24/chargepoint-raises-50-million-to-charge-more-cars/,2016/05/24,"
ChargePoint announced this month that it had raised $50 million in its latest round of funding, thanks in large part to Linse Capital. That makes a total of $164 million raised from investors like BMW iVentures and Siemens, among others. ChargePoint already has the largest EV charging network in North America, with 28,000 stations installed since 2007.
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, global sales of plug-in vehicles rose by about 80 percent in 2015, led by a surge in sales in China. (In the United States, EV sales actually dropped by about 3 percent.) In 2011, about 50,000 EVs were sold worldwide; in 2015, the number topped 565,000. Tenfold in four years isn’t too bad.
Linse Capital noted in the announcement that the additional funds will allow ChargePoint to expand its network outside North America. “This funding will accelerate ChargePoint’s ability to capitalize on that position in the North American market and replicate it in other markets around the world,” said Michael Linse, managing director of Linse Capital.
It’s worth noting, too, that the best-selling electric vehicle in the United States (and the world) for 2015 was the Tesla Model S, which has a range of at least 240 miles as rated by the EPA. Number two was the Nissan Leaf, which has an EPA-rated 107-mile range. It’s also half the price of a Tesla Model S. It’ll be close to the price of a Tesla Model 3, if you can wait a couple of years for that car’s expected 215-mile range.
Many of the electric cars available now, from the Chevy Spark to the Fiat 500e, have EPA ranges in the Leaf’s neighborhood. ChargePoint’s mission is to ease the range anxiety these owners may feel, even though the average American drives 29.2 miles per day, according to a AAA study. Its 28,000 charging points (thus the name) are installed in business parking lots, apartment garages and in homes with Level 2 charging; 310 of the stations have Level 3 Express DC fast charging.
In the chicken-and-egg game of electric vehicle adoptions, ChargePoint is supplying many of the chargers that will make EVs more practical for more people in the future.

1117,NuTonomy raises $16M to make self-driving taxis a reality by 2018,https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/24/nutonomy-raises-16m-to-make-self-driving-taxis-a-reality-by-2018/,2016/05/24,"
Another week, another story about a promising independent self-driving vehicle company. Last week, Otto came out of stealth to offer autonomous technology for trucks, and today MIT spinoff NuTonomy announced $16 million in funding to go after its ambitious goal of offering self-driving taxis within two years.
Cambridge, MA-based NuTonomy was founded by MIT PhDs graduates Karl Iagnemma (CEO) and Emilio Frazzoli (CTO) in 2013 and it is pioneering self-driving technology for cars — yes, the very kind of vehicle that Uber, Google, BMW, GM/Lyft, China’s Baidu and others are currently developing. Like Otto but unlike the aforementioned big names, NuTonomy retrofits existing cars with the technology to make them driverless.
The company announced a $3.6 million seed round in January, which included input from Ford chairman Bill Ford’s Fontinalis Partners fund, and today it revealed its $16 million Series A round. The new investment is led by Highland Capital Partners, with participation from the Singapore Economic Development Board (via its EDBI investment arm), Ford’s fund and other existing backers including Signal Ventures and Samsung Ventures.
NuTonomy maintains strong links with Singapore. The investment aside, it has an office in the city-state and it has trialled self-driving vehicles there. Initially it began in 2014 with autonomous golf cart-style buggies summoned by a smartphone app, but now it is testing a fleet of self-driving taxis which it believes could be deployed commercially in Singapore by 2018.
The startup is working closely with SMART (Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology) as part of the organization’s broad mandate to improve Singapore and its residents’ lifestyles through technology. Singapore’s smart city initiative covers topics as diverse as cashless wallets, open government APIs, a push to promote entrepreneurialism, and increased security surveillance, but self-driving car tech is also on the agenda.

NuTonomy is making inroads in Singapore — and winning the backing of the country’s tech sector — at an interesting time. The country only introduced the first steps to manage on-demand taxi services in April, and yet already the very self-driving concepts they are in the first stages of testing in the U.S. are edging close to hitting the roads in Singapore, which are being designed and architected specifically to support driverless vehicles.
Self-driving NuTonomy cars are also being tested in Michigan and the UK, where Jaguar Land Rover is among the partners.

1118,Lyft will now let you schedule trips ahead of time,https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/23/lyft-will-now-let-you-schedule-trips-ahead-of-time/,2016/05/23,"
Ridesharing platform Lyft heard the people and the people wanted to schedule rides ahead of time. Starting today, Lyft is adding a new feature to let you schedule in advance that ride to the airport or crucial business meeting for which you need to be on time.
Gett, a ridesharing service in New York, has offered this feature for more than a year and we’ve heard rumors Uber has toyed with the idea of scheduling rides ahead of time, but so far does not offer that option.
It’s unclear how the service will be affected by surge pricing during high-traffic times.
It’s also unclear how popular the feature will be with Lyft riders. We asked how much of a demand this was on Lyft’s end and a spokesperson simply added:
“Passengers have asked us for this feature, so we want to roll this out to give additional peace of mind to our users when they have specific trips coming up — like to the airport. People like the security of knowing they already have a ride scheduled.”
I know I’ve personally wanted this option for some time and it would be nice to know a ride is for sure coming at the time I needed to be picked up.
The option works by selecting a pickup location, tapping a clock icon on the right of the Lyft app then selecting the time you want to be picked up. You can update or cancel a scheduled ride up to 30 minutes before pickup without getting charged.
The scheduling feature is only available in San Francisco for now. Lyft will test how it goes and start rolling the feature out from there.
Is this a foreshadowing of our driverless car, chatbot, smart home future? Imagine asking Alexa to schedule you a self-driving car during pre-assessed low-traffic intervals to get you wherever you want to go on time.

Can the smartphone cure Zika?




A driverless car was involved in a traffic accident on a California city street earlier this year. No one was hurt in the small fender bender, but the accident does signal we are making incredible leaps forward on the road toward driverless cars. It may sound counterintuitive, but this crash shows just how far autonomous technology has come in such a short time.
This wasn’t really an accident in the traditional sense — intentional software changes implemented just weeks earlier were likely a contributing factor. With any luck, we will continue to accelerate real-world experimentation and the possibility of more accidents to come.
The incident was partially caused by a subtle software update, implemented a few weeks prior in all of Google’s autonomous cars, that enabled them to “hug the rightmost side of the lane,” a common social norm that allows other drivers to pass on the left. According to the accident report, the Google autonomous vehicle was shifting within its lane to bypass an obstacle in its path when it made contact with a bus approaching from behind. The car was traveling slower than two miles per hour at the time of impact — the bus, about 15 mph.
The fact that Google was testing this new behavior to hug the right side of the lane shows that the technology has developed beyond simply following the rules of the road, but actually driving more “human like” — in line with the social elements of driving.
Accidents like this are vital learning exercises. Google’s driverless vehicles cover more than 10,000 miles a day, in addition to the three million miles of computer-simulated driving taking place daily. But these real-life tests are crucial.
The only way to fully understand our world is to explore it by taking risks.
Driverless cars won’t just change who or what is behind the wheel — they hold the potential to change where we drive, which in turn can change our commutes, vacation plans and how we connect with family and friends. Driverless cars are positioned to forever change the world in which we live… but before they can do that, they must fundamentally and fully understand that world. And the only way to fully understand our world is to explore it by taking risks.
The history of innovation is built upon pushing the frontier of what has been done before. From Lindbergh’s nonstop solo flight across the Atlantic in 1927 to Chuck Yeager breaking the sound barrier in 1947, we have long been demystifying the unknown in the name of progress. While shifting within the same lane may seem like a minute detail, autonomous car developers, like Lindbergh and Yeager before them, are fundamentally changing transportation.
Subtle changes in technology are what will propel us forward. From air bags to automatic windshield wipers, on-board diagnostics to collision avoidance systems, our cars look vastly different than they did 30 years ago, thanks to incremental innovation over a long period of time.
Innovation builds exponentially, but requires risk. The first seven U.S. astronauts were military test pilots. When they were selected in 1959, no one had come close to leaving the earth’s atmosphere. And at the time, no one knew whether any of these seven men would be successful.
These innovators pushed the frontier of what we knew to be possible. Back then we were pushing for discovery and exploration, but we were also in a space race with our Cold War rival, the Soviet Union. Countless Americans risked their lives, and some of the very first Americans in space gave the ultimate sacrifice, to win that race.

Here's a video of the least interesting self-driving car accident ever

Make no mistake: Today, we find ourselves in an even more important race. More than 1 million people are killed annually in traffic deaths globally, and almost all of these deaths are caused by human error. Autonomous vehicles hold the greatest promise to eradicating one of the most deadly forces on earth, but first we must push the limits.
Autonomous vehicles need to learn to be aggressive to the right degree and in the right ways. Much of this can be determined within computer simulations, but some of it must be determined on open roads, where obstacles are dynamic and complex.
There will be accidents along the way. And from these incidents, we will gain treasure troves of intelligence that will push us further along the innovation curve.
Hopefully, we haven’t seen our last autonomous-vehicle accident; hopefully everyone will see them for what they are if/when they occur: invaluable steps pushing us across uncrossed frontiers.

1120,The Europas — It’s time for a different kind of tech conference,https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/20/the-europas-its-time-for-different-type-of-tech-conference/,2016/05/20,"
Let’s face it. Some tech conferences have lost their way. While TechCrunch Disrupt remains a firmly curated, media-driven, event, with hundreds of journalists attending, a couple of other conferences have really gone for scale. A minimum of 15,000 people, thousands of companies, echoing halls — and a lot of investors (and journalists) turning their badges around so they don’t get torn apart by hungry entrepreneurs. Don’t get me wrong — there’s nothing wrong with scale, and it can be very useful. But isn’t it time to bring things back to a more human level?
So, in partnership with TechCrunch, The Europas Conference & Awards, which I founded, has come up with a new model. Think of it as a relaxed, summer prelude to the heat of Disrupt. (Tickets available here).
It goes like this:
• Far fewer people (800-1,000), with many of those specially invited
• Key Founders and investors speaking; many more invited to simply hang out
• Robust, expert discussions and Q&A directly from the main stage
• Intimate “breakout” sessions with key players on vertical topics
• The opportunity to meet almost everyone in those small groups, super-charging your networking
• No VIP rooms, which means you get to interact with the Speakers
• No live stream — you’re either ‘mindfully’ there or you’re not
• Major journalists from major tech titles, newspapers and business broadcasters
• A parallel Founders-only track (PathFounders) geared towards fund-raising and hyper-networking
• A stunning awards dinner and party which honors both the hottest startups and the leading lights in the European startup scene
That’s what The Europas hopes to achieve. A great group of people in the heart of London, Europe’s biggest startup ecosystem, with key investors, Founders and ecosystem-players. Far less pitching, but a lot more humane conversations in an environment where people can get to know each other in a non-transactional way.

And what better way to do that in the summer sun, by the River Thames, with a drink in your hand, the prospect of some great conversations, and a fantastic party and celebration of the European startup scene in the evening.
So who’s coming so far? Here’s a run-round of some of the key speakers, amongst many others. More will be announced soon.

Many new Founders quickly realize that company culture is at least as key to success as their product. To that end, Julia Hartz, co-founder of Eventbrite, will be speaking about how you build a robust team and culture.
Startups often talk about exits, often far too early. Greg Marsh, founder for onefinestay, will be coming along to give a full and frank account of his exit this year to AccorHotels for $170 million, after several years of building his company. How did he move towards the end game? We’ll find out.
Michael Schneider, who built and exited Mobile Roadie, will give us the scoop on how he’s building Service, his new startup, out of LA, and what the future of customer service actually looks like.

Bethany Koby, cofounder of Technology Will Save Us, will talk about the trials and tribulations of building a hardware startup out of Europe.
We’ll have John Henderson of White Star Capital discussing Artificial Intelligence with Azeem Azhar of The Exponential View and Anita Schjøll Brede of hot new AI startup out of Norway, Iris.ai. Founder-turned-VC Andy McLoughlin (Huddle) will be grilling startups in our Live Office Hours session with Local Global’s Saul Klein, Sonali de Rycker of Accel Partners, and Connect Ventures’ Sitar Teli and Nic Brisbourne of Forward Partners
We’ll be investigating and asking where the innovation is in Fintech with Passion Capital’s Eileen Burbidge, Mark Tluszcz of Mangrove Capital Partners, Taavet Hinrikus of Transferwise, and Tina Baker of Jag Shaw Baker.
Did someone says EUnicorn? What does the future hold for Europe’s Unicorns? We ask Qualcomm Ventures’ Jason Ball, and Balderton Capital’s Suranga Chandratillake will it all go Pete Tong for the European unicorn.
Other VCs and angels attending include Christian Hernandez (White Star Capital), Nenad Marovac (DN Capital), Irena Goldenberg (Highland Capital), Omri Benayoun (Partech), Tracy Doree (Spring Partners), and Harry Briggs (BGF Ventures).
You’ll hear about Cyber Security startups from Jonathan Luff (Cylon) and Ruth Anderson (Head of UK Cyber at KPMG). Growth Hacking will come courtesy of the founders of Secret Sauce. The Internet of Things will be debated by Thomas Nicholls (Sigfox) and Andy Hobsbawm (EVRYTHNG).

On Health startups we’ll have Ida Tin, Founder of Clue from Berlin. And on Internationalization Brynne Herbert from MoveGuides. More to come!
Confirmed Media so far include Liam Boogar (RudeBaguuette), Robin Wauters (Tech.EU), Madhumita Murgia (The Daily Telegraph) and James Cook (Business Insider).

We’ll also get a different flavor from world-renowned speaker Jonathan MacDonald, founder of the Thought Expansion Network, who will present the exclusive findings of his survey “What gives a company the most competitive advantage” which you can participate in here.

1121,Nikola Motor Company unveils its electric (mostly) truck,https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/19/nikola-motor-company-unveils-its-electric-mostly-truck/,2016/05/19,"
It’s been a big month for trucking innovations. In addition to Otto’s autonomous truck announcement, there’s the unveiling of Nikola Motor Company’s electric long-haul rig concept. The Nikola One, as it’s called, has “6×6 all-wheel drive,” with 800-volt AC motors and regenerative braking at all wheels. And a whopping 2000 horsepower, compared to the 400-500 hp that most trucks have.
It also has a tank that holds 150 gallons of compressed natural gas, which powers a turbine that charges the 320 kWh lithium-ion battery pack. The idea is that drivers would not have to stop to charge; the CNG plus regenerative braking would be able to power the truck for 1200 miles of driving. It’s similar to how the Chevy Volt works, where the gasoline tank recharges the batteries. The Volt and the Nikola One are both electric vehicles in that electric power from the batteries turns the wheels, but the batteries are most often charged by an on-board generator or turbine.
That’s not the only similarity to another company that Nikola Motor Company has. You may have noticed that it uses the first name of inventor Nikola Tesla; the last name has already been used. NMC makes no bones about its admiration for Tesla Motors, but where Tesla started with a wee roadster and worked toward the midsize sedan, NMC is coming at the problem from the opposite—and much larger—side of the equation. It hinted at more vehicles for other markets to come in the future on its website, but NMC is likely hoping to get the Nikola One onto the road before tackling passenger vehicles.
Nikola Zero rendering
For those who aren’t quite ready to plunk down $1500 for a reservation on a $350,000 electric tractor-trailer, NMC also announced a dune-buggy-esque 4×4 off-road vehicle called the Nikola Zero. For a $750 reservation ($42,000 MSRP), you can get in line for 520 hp of all-electric, waterproof driving. The Zero plugs in like most EVs do to recharge the 440-volt lithium-ion batteries rather than using CNG and a turbine, though it does have solar panels on the roof to power the 12V battery.
While there are plenty of specs and numbers published on NMC’s web site for both vehicles, there isn’t a delivery date for either of them. Also, these vehicles do not yet exist in the physical world—at least not in a form that NMC can use for photos. So far, the only images of the One and Zero are digital renderings. We’ll see if a thorough list of stats is enough to raise the capital needed get these vehicles from CAD to the real world.

1122,Uber confirms it’s testing self-driving cars in Pittsburgh,https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/19/uber-confirms-its-testing-self-driving-cars-in-pittsburgh/,2016/05/19,"
Uber has finally confirmed testing self-driving cars in Pittsburgh, PA, according to a report out of the Pittsburgh Tribune.
Though we’ve known about Uber’s autonomous vehicle ambitions, especially considering the opening of its Pittsburgh-based Advanced Technology Center more than a year ago, this is the first time the company has publicly admitted testing these vehicles.
In fact, Uber’s John Bares took a Tribune-Review reporter on a ride in one of the company’s Ford Fusion hybrids, which reportedly drove itself for some portions of the trip.
The company also wrote a blog post about it.
Bares said that Pittsburgh provides a perfect testing ground for Uber’s autonomous vehicles because of its snowy and rainy weather, narrow and hilly streets, and outdated infrastructure.
Essentially, if Uber can do it there, they can do it anywhere.
Through a combination of multiple cameras, lasers and sensors, Uber’s self-driving cars can see as far as 100 meters in any direction. Thus far, there have been no crashes with regular cars, according to the company.
Uber is one of a handful of companies, including Google, Lyft, Volvo and Ford, that has joined the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, lobbying to the government to rapidly draft legislation for autonomous vehicle penetration while keeping safety top of mind.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has said it could have legislation for self-driving cars ready as early as July.
That said, Uber is a relatively new entrant to the space when you remember that Google has been testing its self-driving cars on California streets since 2009.
Bares confirmed that the technology showed off on Wednesday was at an early stage, so don’t expect a driverless Uber to pick you up any time soon.

Tesla — with a significant chunk contributed by Elon Musk — is selling around $2 billion worth of stock in an equity offering in order to accelerate production of the Model 3, according to a regulatory filing filed today.
The company is selling 6.8 million shares in the stock offering, which at its current price of around $205 amounts to roughly $1.4 billion. Musk is selling around 2.8 million shares — or close to $600 million — as part of the offering to satisfy taxes on options he is exercising. Even after the sale, the number of shares of common stock held by Musk will increase, the company said.

The net proceeds of the sale are going toward Tesla’s ambitious goal of producing 500,000 cars annually by 2018. The company originally expected to hit that number by 2020, but bumped up that goal in conjunction with its new earnings report based on the high volume of pre-orders for the new Model 3. With so many pre-orders coming in — the company said it has 325,000 reservations for the Model 3 — it’s not a surprise that the company wants to ensure that it’s able to fulfill that production.
Ironically, Goldman Sachs is underwriting the offering, and just hours earlier the firm upgraded the stock to a “buy” rating, signaling that Goldman Sachs felt the stock was undervalued and worth purchasing. Stocks tend to move on these new ratings issued by banks, and Tesla shares were up 3 percent on the day.
As part of its earnings report, Tesla also said it still plans to deliver 80,000 to 90,000 new vehicles this year. The earnings followed a bit of a mixed few months for Tesla, which unveiled the Model 3 — a $35,000 electric car — earlier this year. It’s one of Tesla’s most important launches, and critical for the company’s success, so it seems like the company wants to ensure it has the capital to meet the demand it’s seeing for the car.
Shares of Tesla dipped slightly on the news, though the stock has certainly had a rocky year. Bloomberg recently reported that two top execs were leaving the company ahead of mass production of the Model 3, which sent the stock down around 4 percent. Net net, however, shares of Tesla are pretty flat.

There’s a small footnote in the filing that also indicates the company may “use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering for working capital or other general corporate purposes.”

1125,Uber and Grab suspend their motorbike taxi services in Bangkok,https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/18/uber-suspends-its-motorbike-taxi-service-in-bangkok-three-months-after-launch/,2016/05/18,"
Uber and Grab, the two largest on-demand taxi services in Southeast Asia, have suspended their motorbike taxi services in Bangkok following orders from the government. UberMoto launched in Bangkok just three months ago, while GrabBike has operated there since last August.
Transport ministry official Nunthapong Cherdchoo told Reuters that the services conflict with existing motorbike taxi services in the Thai capital. The government has pressured both services since they launched in Thailand.
UberMoto, which has since launched in India and Indonesia after Bangkok, takes the company’s on-demand taxi concept to two wheels. Motorbike taxis are a popular form on transport in many cities in Southeast Asia since drivers can weave the traffic-clogged roads faster than four-wheeled vehicles.
However, with motorbike taxi fleets on every street corner in Bangkok already, UberMoto’s arrival hasn’t been smooth. Uber’s aggressive pricing, which consisted of free rides for passengers during the launch period, attracted pressure from existing bike taxi drivers and authorities, who have been arresting motorbike drivers on the street. (This despite UberMoto debuting with the endorsement of the Thai transport police who were represent at the launch event in February.)
Uber has a reputation for butting heads with authorities in the West, but in Asia it has adopted a more conciliatory tone. Case in point, the company’s confirmation of UberMoto’s suspension is presented in a positive light:
We are pleased that the Thai Government is open to discussing new rules that would enable services like uberMOTO for passengers to operate. And we’re grateful for their support when it comes to using motorbikes as couriers and to deliver food. This means we will be able to launch delivery services like uberRUSH and uberEATS as soon as possible, so please stay tuned.
Grab initially did not suspend GrabBike, but just hours after Uber’s announcement it followed suit and withdrew its service, too.
With reference to the Department of Land Transportation’s announcement dated May 17, 2016, Grab Thailand will temporarily stop the GrabBike (Ride) service. We are in the process of transitioning over 10,000 GrabBike (Ride) drivers to the GrabBike (Delivery) service only. Grab Thailand is a local company and we are committed to providing safe rides for all and improving the lives of our drivers. We look forward to discussions with the government and all industry stakeholders to ensure that the GrabBike service operates within the proper guidelines, and work together towards a well-regulated ecosystem of complementary transport services.
Uber and Grab have had similar skirmishes with officials in Thailand, among many other parts of Asia, as their on-demand services were initially seen as threats to existing taxi services. That’s exactly the same case here, and it seems likely that a resolution will found in time. (Uber, notably, said UberMotor is “temporarily” suspended.)
It’s worth observing that Grab, which has raised over $700 million from investors like SoftBank and China’s Didi Chuxing, took a more aggressive position in this situation by not initially withdrawing its service. It could just be a one-off scenario but, with regulatory issues flaring up in Indonesia and surely other markets as and when GrabBike expands, it’ll be interesting to see whether Grab repeats that approach.
Since both companies have a penchant for making long statements, we’re including them both below for posterity.
Here’s Grab’s original statement:

With reference to the Department of Land Transportation’s announcement dated May 17, 2016, Grab Thailand is currently in the process of internal discussions towards a conclusion for next steps. We will keep you posted when there’s any further update. GrabBike was launched as a solution to two big problems in Bangkok – safety and traffic. As with our other services, the Grab team has made sure that GrabBike adheres to the core of our organization, which is safety. For passengers, safety is ensured by Grab’s additional personal accident insurance coverage for both bikers and passengers, and the helmets we provide. In addition, our bikers go through rigorous safety training before being allowed to make trips. GrabBike has also helped to ease the transport problems that exist within Bangkok, where traffic congestion is rated as one of the worst in the world, by providing an efficient smartphone-based platform that allows passengers to connect to available motorcycle taxis.
Aside from the safety trainings and free accident insurance that drivers get, we are also helping them enhance their livelihoods. GrabBike bikers have the possibility of taking parcel delivery jobs when they are not picking up passengers to reduce idle time on the roads and increase productivity. GrabBike is focused on providing convenient and safe rides for passengers and will look to continue our dialogue with all industry stakeholders on using technology to make Thailand’s public transport safer and even more convenient.

And here is Uber’s full statement:

Earlier this year Thailand helped Uber achieve a world-first with the launch of uberMOTO, a global pilot and our first two-wheeled ridesharing service.
Despite strong support from Thai riders and drivers, we have decided to temporarily suspend our Bangkok pilot, starting at noon while we work on creating modern regulations for app-based motorbike services with the Government.
We are pleased that the Thai Government is open to discussing new rules that would enable services like uberMOTO for passengers to operate. And we’re grateful for their support when it comes to using motorbikes as couriers and to deliver food. This means we will be able to launch delivery services like uberRUSH and uberEATS as soon as possible, so please stay tuned.
It’s been two years since Uber launched our ridesharing app in Thailand. We are deeply committed to this country, its amazing people, and to our goal of regulated ridesharing in every city where we operate. We want to thank Thai riders and drivers for their extraordinary support. uberX and UberBLACK will continue to operate as usual — offering everyone a safe, affordable, convenient ride in minutes all at the push of a button.
By working together with the Government we will ensure that cities across Thailand can benefit from ridesharing: including the ability to cut drink driving, reduce congestion as well as pollution and better serve communities with little to no public transit.

1126,Tesloop offers city-to-city autonomous travel in a Tesla,https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/17/tesloop-offers-city-to-city-autonomous-travel-in-a-tesla/,2016/05/17,"
Travelers in the Southwest have a new all-electric option: long-distance car sharing in a Tesla with Autopilot. The service is called Tesloop, and it currently serves 15 cities in southern California, plus Henderson and Las Vegas in Nevada and Phoenix, Arizona.
The idea came to founder Haydn (one name only; probably because he’s still a minor) in May 2015, when he turned 16 and got his drivers license. He figured he could get a Tesla Model S 85D and drive people back and forth from Los Angeles to Las Vegas a couple times a week to cover the cost of insurance and the lease payment. Haydn presented the idea to Elon Musk at a Tesla shareholders meeting, and soon after he had a team of cofounders and seed money from Clearstone Ventures, plus angel investors from the likes of Tesla and Facebook. Tesloop was born.
Almost.
It turns out it’s challenging if not impossible to get commercial insurance when you’re 16 years old and a new license holder yourself. The cofounders, who are all long out of high school, took on Pilot duties (that’s what Tesloop calls its drivers), and the company was then able to begin offering rides in July 2015. When he’s not in school, Haydn is now in charge of PR and fleet maintenance.
So far, that fleet is still just two Teslas strong, running regular trips between Las Vegas and the LA-Orange County area, usually for less than $100 one way. Tesloop is doing one trip per car, so four people per car per day, according to CEO Rahul Sonnad. This adds up to about 18,000 miles a month, and Sonnad says Tesloop is aiming for about 30,000 miles per month as trips increase and the fleet grows.
“We have demonstrated to our own satisfaction that the cost per mile to run electric vehicles is disruptive when you start to drive them continually,” Sonnad said in an email interview. “Your car cost and fuel cost really start to transform the overall economics.”
In order to keep those cars driving continually, Tesloop makes heavy use of the Model S Autopilot system. “Driving with Autopilot on makes the task nearly effortless and much safer,” Sonnad said. “I drive almost every weekend, and I find that I can go to Las Vegas and back and still be mentally sharp. By contrast, when I drive four or five hours in traffic without Autopilot, I am super tired and just want to chill out and watch TV afterwards. I also feel that there are many times where, had I not had Autopilot, the chance of an accident would have been much higher. You really don’t drift across lane lines or risk rear-ending the car in front of you when it’s on.”
Even though Autopilot is there to help, Tesloop’s drivers are still screened and interviewed, and they go through background and driving checks. They’re also trained on all the tech aspects of driving a Tesla; besides Autopilot, they learn about suspension and driving mode settings, for example.
Tesloop also makes sure the Pilots have good customer service sensibilities. Besides being an efficient and zero-emissions way to travel, Tesloop also wants it to be pleasant. It provides water, snacks, in-car WiFi, and even travel pillows. Because if you’re going to share a ride from LA to Las Vegas with strangers, it had better be comfy.

1127,"Otto, founded by ex-Googlers, is bringing self-driving technology to trucks",https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/17/otto-founded-by-ex-googlers-is-bringing-self-driving-technology-to-trucks/,2016/05/17,"
Self-driving cars are very much a part of the future of tech, with Google, Uber, Apple and plenty of other top names working to develop autonomous vehicles. But what about trucks? That’s where Otto, a startup that has come out of stealth, is aiming to shape the future.
Founded by former Googlers Anthony Levandowski, Lior Ron, Don Burnette, and Claire Delaunay, Otto wants to “rethink” the commercial trucking industry.
In a Medium post, Levandowski, who lead Google’s self-driving car efforts, and Ron, formerly with Google Maps and Motorola, explained that not only do trucks account for an oversized slice of pollution in the U.S. — 28 percent of road pollution despite making up just one percent of all traffic, they claim — but they cause a large number of fatalities, are inefficient and, to top it off, there’s an increasing shortage of drivers. That creates the perfect storm for a tech-based solution, Otto’s founders believe.
Otto started out with tools to help truck drivers perform their job with increased safety, but now it is working on technology that, in time, can automate parts of the drive on highways.
Unlike others, which are designing new vehicles that drive autonomously, Otto focuses on technology that can be fitted into trucks that are on the road now. Rather than eradicating drivers by making them obsolete, the immediate goal is assistance. The duo told Backchannel that, among many things, they aim to let drivers safely take a sleep break while leaving their truck driving autonomously.
The company said it has already completed one public highway demo of its system, and it is hatching grander plans beyond that.
“We intend to enhance the capabilities of the Otto truck, collect safety data to demonstrate its benefits, and bring this technology to every corner of the U.S. highway system,” Levandowski and Lior wrote.

Otto’s team of 40 includes many former Googlers, as you might expect, and other staffers have worked at Tesla, HERE, Apple, Cruise, and various automobile companies.
The company has lurked under the radar before its unveiling today — many of its staff haven’t updated their LinkedIn profiles with their new roles, for example — and there will be many questions about it, such as which investors are bankrolling it.
Further down the road — no pun intended — it’ll be interesting to see how others in the autonomous space react to Otto’s emergence. Apple is reported to have “hundreds” of people working on its secretive car project, Faraday Future has emerged — flushed with cash from Chinese investors — and there is, of course, Google. Does the Google connection make Otto and its tech ripe for an acquisition? Will others want a part of the company? We shall see.

1128,Roadie is like Uber for shipping,https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/16/roadie-is-like-uber-for-shipping/,2016/05/16,"
“Someone is always leaving everywhere”: that’s the idea behind Roadie, a peer-to-peer package delivery service launched last year by Marc Gorlin. There are something like 250 million vehicles on the road every day, Gorlin said, so he decided to take advantage of this resource by allowing people to help their neighbors out by driving things to places they’re already going.
Gorlin said in a phone interview that Roadie has already had 250,000 downloads and 20,000 drivers in its first year, and thousands of items are ferried to their destinations in private vehicles each month. The cost of shipping the item depends on its size and how far it’s going; an across-town delivery costs about $8, while a piece of furniture being moved a couple of states away will be a few hundred dollars. When you post a gig on Roadie, drivers headed in the right direction will make an offer, which you can accept or ignore.
Drivers are rated and reviewed, and Roadie relies on that pretty heavily. Drivers who’ve logged lots of miles get a Road Warrior badge to distinguish their record. You get to pick your driver, unlike Uber, where you get whichever driver answers your request and shows up at the curb. Roadie also has an agreement with Waffle House to take the Craigslist creep factor out of the transaction. Whether you’re picking up or dropping off, you can meet at a 24-hour Waffle House and get a free cup of coffee, thanks to your Roadhouse benefits.
There’s a photographic chain of command, Gorlin says, to make sure your item arrives in the same shape it was shipped. Every gig is covered by $500 in insurance, but you can buy up to $10,000 extra. All drivers get free roadside assistance when they’re on a gig, and they get a summary of miles driven on gigs at the end of the year so they can write those miles off on their taxes. And you get what Gorlin calls “the most deterministic tracking,” since you can follow the gig on your phone, and even call or text the driver.
That community is the key for Gorlin. “We had a couple of guys road tripping from Texas to Oregon,” he said, “and they picked up gigs to pay for gas. They went to a pick-up at a house and found a dying grandmother and grieving family, and they asked to pray with the family. Then they delivered the grandmother’s stuff to her granddaughter in Oregon. You don’t pray with your postman.”
Gorlin loves to tell stories about gigs, like the guy in Brooklyn who found the perfect stained glass window for him mom’s antique shop—in Atlanta. He trusted Roadie more than a traditional carrier with the fragile piece. Or the woman who needed to send a 9-foot surfboard 400 miles as a birthday present for her boyfriend. “It’s like creating magic,” Gorlin said. “People can send things where they couldn’t before.”
Of course, you can ship anything anywhere if you’ve got the cash and the packing materials, but that’s another difference for Roadie gigs—no boxes or Styrofoam peanuts required. You can help the driver lash that highboy into a truck bed, or you can just throw your stuff in the backseat of the driver’s SUV. Roadie has even added pet gigs to get your animals where they need to go, though drivers seem to need to only answer a few questions to get the Pet Lover Badge initially.
What makes this different from on-demand ride sharing services like Lyft, or even food delivery services like Door Dash or Caviar, is using the app to mesh the driver’s goals with the shipper’s goals. “On demand means someone’s coming where they weren’t already going and taking you somewhere they weren’t already going,” Gorlin said. “With Roadie, this is where you’re already going. It’s more efficient.” No packing peanuts necessary.

1129,The importance of black boxes in an autonomous automotive future,https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/13/the-importance-of-black-boxes-in-an-autonomous-automotive-future/,2016/05/13,"
Right now, if you get into a crash, it’s usually going to be a driver’s fault — a human driver. Parts can fail and tires can burst, but about 90 percent of all car crashes are caused by human error, depending on which study you read. But in the not-too-distant future, that clear-cut cause will evaporate as more vehicles take over more driving tasks, creating more and more data as they do. And that data gets recorded in a black box.
As of September 1, 2014, all newly manufactured passenger vehicles are required to have a black box on board, though the majority of cars had the technology on board well before the deadline. It’s officially known as an event data recorder (EDR), and it records on a loop metrics such as speed, brake application, air bag deployment and seat belt use from the car’s sensors. According to Consumer Reports, an EDR grabs about 5 seconds of data before the crash and just 1 second after.
As sensors proliferate on vehicles, they are gathering more information. Szabolcs Szakacsits, founder and CTO of Tuxera, said the software his company provides for black boxes in autonomous cars records data from 16 sensors simultaneously, adding information on things like tire pressure, camera images, radar data and driver profiles. So in the case of a crash, the black box will know where you put your seat and what radio stations you like.
“There’s a convergence going on,” Szakacsits said in an email interview. “As vehicles are becoming more autonomous, more and more sensors are integrated inside the car, which requires the black box to record, store, and read the data, like distance to the next vehicle, road marks, traffic signs, lights, people, and other objects surrounding the car.”
Tuxera uses a Flash file system integrated with the EDR to make sure the data recorded is consistent, even if the power gets cut during the crash. “That is why the software components used in automotive applications need to be more robust,” Szakacsits said. “It is critical that the data is well kept and fail safe. You can’t afford to have frame drops from the dashboard camera, for example, because that is critical information in case of accidents.”
In the future, responsibility for crashes will likely be clear-cut once again, when autonomous cars can drive themselves completely. The human passengers likely won’t be paying attention to the road at all, and the cars themselves are predicted to crash less often — at least, that’s the dream. But just in case the future isn’t so shiny, Tuxera is developing the black box software that will be available for self-driving consumer cars by 2020.

1130,"Apple invests $1B in Didi Chuxing, China’s largest ride-hailing app",https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/12/apple-invests-1b-in-didi-chuxing-chinas-largest-ride-hailing-app/,2016/05/12,"
Apple made the bombshell announcement today that it has invested $1 billion in China’s top ride hailing app. Didi Chuxing (formerly called Didi Kuaidi) is often described in U.S. media as Uber’s Chinese rival, but it already dominates the market by far. The company claims it fulfilled one billion rides last year and holds 87 percent of the country’s private ride-hailing market.
In an interview with Reuters, Apple CEO Tim Cook said, “We are making the investment for a number of strategic reasons, including a chance to learn more about certain segments of the China market. Of course, we believe it will deliver a strong return for our invested capital as well.”
Didi Chuxing told Reuters that this is its single largest round of funding so far. It claims to currently complete more than 11 million rides a day and have over 14 million drivers on its platform. The company’s other major investors include Tencent and Alibaba, two of China’s largest Internet companies, and SoftBank.
Meanwhile, Uber’s biggest ally and backer in China is Baidu, which runs the country’s top search engine and online map services, including apps.
According to a WSJ report from February, the company was then in the process of finalizing a round for $1 billion at a valuation of $20 billion. A Didi Chuxing representative said Apple’s investment is part of the same round, but declined to confirm the valuation. TechCrunch has also emailed Apple for more information.
In a press release, Didi Chuxing founder and CEO Cheng Wei said, “The endorsement from Apple is an enormous encouragement and inspiration for our four-year-old company. Didi will work hard with our drivers, riders and global partners, to make available to every citizen flexible and reliable mobility choices, and help cities solve transportation, environmental and employment challenges.”
China is on its way to becoming Apple’s biggest iPhone market, but the company has faced a few recent setbacks there. After years of giving it a relatively free rein for a U.S. tech company, the Chinese government ordered the closure of iBooks Store and iTunes and Movies just six months after the services launched in China.
Furthermore, while Apple’s sales in China are still growing, it’s at a much slower rate than before as the Chinese economy becomes sluggish and the smartphone market in general faces less demand. Concerns about Apple’s reliance on China prompted activist shareholder Carl Icahn to sell his entire stake in the company earlier this year.
Investing in Didi Chuxing allows Apple to grab a foothold in the Chinese tech market that reaches beyond iPhones—and also gives it a new platform for its other technology. For example, if Didi Chuxing uses CarPlay, that gives Apple another outlet to sell software services in China beside the iPhone, as well as valuable data to tailor apps and maps for Chinese users. Didi Chuxing is also a major potential customer once Apple’s self-driving car comes to fruition.

1131,Amazon’s ‘Top Gear’ car show to be called The Grand Tour,https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/11/amazons-top-gear-car-show-to-be-called-the-grand-tour/,2016/05/11,"
The (in)famous former Top Gear presenter trio: Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, who last summer signed to Amazon’s Prime video streaming platform to make a new car show to be screened on its platform this year, have revealed what it’s going to be called — and it’s The Grand Tour.
Why a tour? Because the show format will see the studio portion of each episode screened from a new location somewhere in the world — from inside “a giant tent”, rather than a studio. So really they should have called it ‘Carry On Camping With Clarkson & Co.’
The format of The Grand Tour will also feature “short films shot in different locations around the globe” — so basically it sounds exactly like Top Gear, just with a new name. And a tent. Why mess with a winning formula, eh?
The presenters make a lot of this “giant tent” in the PR announcing the show’s name, so it can quite possibly be seen as a troll of the BBC, the owner of the Top Gear format. The Corporation decided not to renew Clarkson’s contract last year, after investigating an “unprovoked physical attack” on a Top Gear producer by Clarkson.
And where Clarkson goes, May and Hammond duly follow… And so The Grand Tour.
Tickets for attending the tent-portion of the show will be released through a sweepstakes this summer. It’s not clear if they will only be open to Amazon customers or more widely. Amazon said details of the location schedule and information on how to apply for tickets will be announced shortly.
The new Top Gear Grand Tour will be screened to Amazon Prime customers, starting this fall. Amazon will clearly be hoping to pick up some of the millions of viewers who tuned in to watch Top Gear when it was anchored by Clarkson to drive (pun intended) uptake of its Amazon Prime paid subscription.
The last episode of Top Gear with Clarkson & co. presenting drew some 5.3 million viewers.
The BBC has since rebooted Top Gear with a new line-up of presenters. This new BBC car show, sans Clarkson & co., will kick off its first episode on May 29.

1132,Semi-driving the semi-autonomous 2016 Volvo XC90,https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/10/semi-driving-the-semi-autonomous-2016-volvo-xc90/,2016/05/10,"
The 2016 Volvo XC90 T6 R-Design has an all-new look and a powerful 2-liter supercharged engine with 316 horsepower. But this is TechCrunch, where we’re all about that tablet-like center console and pushing all the buttons to see how well the vehicle can drive on its own.

Volvo’s goal is to eliminate injuries or fatalities in crashes in its vehicles by 2020, which means removing as much human error as they can. The semi-autonomous driving features in the 2016 XC90 take a pretty big step in that direction. Whenever the SUV’s sensors can detect lanes and a car in front of it, it will handle driving tasks all on its own.
I tested this out several times during the week I had the XC90. When I was creeping along the highway under 30 mph, I could press a button in the steering wheel to let the system know I wanted it use Adaptive Cruise Control with Pilot Assist. If conditions were in place – lanes and a car to follow – the system would take over. I could do all my dance moves while Beyoncé sang about Becky with the good hair.
If the XC90 lost track of the lanes, it would ask me to handle steering duties with a ping and a message in the dashboard. This is called the “human-machine interface,” and some systems handle it better than others. I thought Volvo did well to alert me without scaring me that something was wrong. Vehicles are not yet capable of letting humans zone out completely; you still have to be alert to traffic and ready to resume control even while dancing to Beyoncé in the driver’s seat.

Even without using Pilot Assist, the Lane Keeping Aid used lane markers to keep me from drifting. On roads that were very familiar to me, and where I do have a tendency to drift as I take a corner, the wheel would tug a bit to put the vehicle back where it belonged. Fair enough.
But it was interesting to encounter the ethical dilemma aspect of autonomous driving while using that feature. There’s a hilly stretch of road near my house that’s popular with hardcore cyclists in training. There is no shoulder, so drivers just have to keep an eye out and pass when it’s safe. There is, however, a bright yellow double line in the middle of the road. So when I deliberately straddled the line to pass a biker making his way up the hill, the steering wheel of the XC90 tugged a bit toward the cyclist. Its programming told it that straddling the double yellow line is a terrible idea–which it usually is–without taking into account the human driver deciding not to knock over a bicyclist.
Nearly all of the technology is in place to make autonomous cars happen very soon, but it’s these tricky human decisions that algorithms can’t yet process. And Volvo’s system is gentle–it didn’t completely take over and run the cyclist off the road. It deferred to my human judgement without a fight. We worked together to parallel park; I worked the brake and gas while it did the steering. I let it drive me partway home in heavy traffic after a half marathon that turned my legs to jelly. So even using semi-autonomous features only about 10 percent of the time I had this Volvo was welcome.
The idea is to let these features take over more often and for longer as the technology evolves. Volvo is further testing semi-autonomous vehicles beginning next year in the Drive Me London program, with data analysis assistance from Thatcham Research. By 2018, the program will be testing about 100 fully autonomous vehicles on the streets of the United Kingdom.

1133,TrapTap maps speed traps and more,https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/05/traptap-maps-speed-traps-and-more/,2016/05/05,"
TrapTap, which has raised over $200,000 on Kickstarter with about a week to go, alerts drivers to speed traps, school zones, speed zones, and red light cameras by blinking red, green, or blue. But it’s not a radar detector; it’s more like connected car training wheels.
TrapTap says it has mapped every school zone and red light camera in 60 countries. You stick the little round puck on the dashboard and connect it to an app on your phone via Bluetooth so it can use the GPS. Then, when you’re at an intersection with a red light camera or near a school zone, the puck glows red.
But that’s not all — there’s also the tapping part. When you notice a speed trap set up along the highway, you double tap the device. This “sets the trap” and uploads the location to TrapTap, which then lets other drivers behind you know there’s a cop with a speed detector hiding behind the next hill. On the other hand, if you’re driving along and the puck glows blue but there’s no sign of smokey, another double tap will let the system know the trap has cleared out.
Like more sophisticated live mapping services, such as HERE HD Live Map, TrapTap uses algorithms to weed out false positives. The more data the system receives, the more reliable the information will be.
The TrapTap Kickstarter campaign shows that people are willing to provide — and receive — this data. More than 2000 units have been claimed already, raising more than three times the campaign’s goal of $64,316. The retail price will be set at about $180. And batteries are included.

Tesla says it is expecting to hit its goal of producing 500,000 cars annually — including the Model S, Model X and Model 3 — two years earlier than expected, meeting that expectation by 2018.
All this is coming ahead of a critical next year for Tesla with the expansion of its line of vehicles with the Model 3 and updates to its Model S. Tesla also said it is re-affirming its plan to deliver 80,000 to 90,000 new vehicles this year. That means it’s going to have to have a roughly 5x increase in production capability in the next two years, a pretty ambitious target to hit given some of the troubles it’s had with its previous models. Still, given the number of reservations for the Model 3, that might not be too far out of reach.
The company made the announcement as part of its first-quarter earnings report, where it slightly beat analyst expectations and sent the stock up around 5 percent. Tesla said it expects to produce around 20,000 vehicles in the second quarter this year. The company said it has 325,000 reservations for the Model 3.
Tesla also said volume Model 3 production and deliveries will start late 2017.

Tesla recalls 2,700 Model X vehicles over potentially dangerous seat flaw

Tesla’s past few months have been a mixed bag. The company unveiled its hotly anticipated Model 3 $35,000 car. It has a baseline distance of around 215 miles per charge, though Musk said the company hopes to exceed that. It’s probably Tesla’s most important launch yet, bringing the company’s vehicles down-market to a more affordable (sort of) price range.
At the same time, in April, the company said it would recall 2,700 Model X vehicles over concerns that its third-row seat could have issues. That’s not necessarily the only hiccup with the Model X, which also saw plenty of delays ahead of its launch. There were also reportedly other problems with the Model X that required repairs.
And to make things a little worse, Bloomberg reported that two top execs were leaving the company ahead of mass production of the Model 3. That news alone sent the stock down around 4 percent. The company’s stock has been overall pretty flat, down around 3 percent on the year.
Tesla’s jump today essentially reversed losses on the day following reports of executive departures. After the report, shares jumped as much as 7 percent before leveling off. Tesla beat what industry watchers were looking for in terms of the amount of money it made, posting a loss of 57 cents per share. Analysts were expecting a loss of 58 cents per share on revenue of $1.6 billion. Tesla brought in $1.6 billion in revenue, in line with what was expected for the company.

There’s a lot to like about Google’s own self-driving cars, but if you’ve got kids, you’d need a fleet just to get them to the soccer game and back. That, presumably, is why the Google initiative’s first direct collaboration with an automaker will automate a nice, roomy new Pacifica minivan.
Not only is the mileage great (it’s a hybrid) but there’s space for the whole family! But more importantly for Google, it’s a very different type of vehicle from what the project has tested thus far, although the Lexus SUVs used early on were fairly traditional.

“The minivan design also gives us an opportunity to test a larger vehicle that could be easier for passengers to enter and exit, particularly with features like hands-free sliding door,” read a post at the project’s Google+ page.
So while point-to-point travel for individuals is certainly on the table for future Google autonomous vehicles, the company is clearly looking into broader applications that require a different approach.
Self-driving cars could be incredibly useful for disabled or aged people, for instance, but the question of accessibility — wheelchair accommodation, an interface for the seeing-impaired, etc. — immediately appears. A big platform like the Pacifica is a more realistic test bed for exploring such considerations.
Around 100 vehicles will be specially prepared by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to work with Google’s sensor suite. For the present, they’ll be limited to testing on the company’s California test track.

1136,Tesla’s bioweapon mode is a stroke of genius for developing markets,https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/02/tesla-bioweapon-mode-for-whiffy-cities/,2016/05/02,"
Tesla today shared details of how effective its particulate filters are. Spoiler alert: They are so good, not only do they clean up the air inside the car, they make the world outside the car cleaner, too. It may not be obvious why this matters: The company is aiming squarely at a very specific type of customer, which may be the company’s way into markets like China and India.
Let’s be frank for a second: Cabin air filters are nothing new; they’ve been rolled out in luxury cars since the late 1970s, and across a broader number of vehicles from the mid 1980s onward. HEPA filters in cars are more novel, not least because for this level of filtration to work, the car must be pretty air-tight to begin with, which traditionally hasn’t been a priority in automotive design.
Tesla’s Bioweapon Defense mode is able to scrub a near-lethal dose of pollution down to untraceable in a matter of minutes. Impressive. Note also that the pollution level outside the car dropped significantly.
It’s hard to see adding HEPA filters in the first place, but can adding a layer of one-upmanship on top of that with a Bioweapon Defense Mode button be seen as anything other than a spectacular PR stunt? What nobody seems to have done so far is ask why Tesla is making such a big deal out of it.
The Tesla blog post offers some hints of the most obvious kind. Talking about bioweapons is a way to catch the headlines (just look up there! I fell for it, too!), but the real talking point is that by using industrial-grade particulate filters, the Tesla Model S and Model X are spectacularly well-suited for use in environments where pollution is off the charts.
Of course, the current Tesla models are a lot of things, but one thing they ain’t is cheap.
Put the two together, and you get a Venn diagram of Tesla’s target audience here: People who have access to significant amounts of money and who suffer from tremendous amounts of pollution.
Pollution is a global problem not equally distributed
Around 7 percent of the top 1,000 most-polluted cities in the world are in the U.S., which is the first piece of the puzzle: Creating cars that are particularly well-designed for your home market is just common sense — especially if you’re an electric car company who inherently has a horse in the race when it comes to making a statement about pollution.

Looking at the rest of the data is far more interesting, however, and offers some clues as to why this matters to the car manufacturer: India, China, Turkey, France and Germany all feature heavily in the top 1,000, and, while not all markets are equally affluent (average GDP per capita varies wildly between these countries), there is no denying there is a large number of people who can afford — and do buy — luxury cars in all these countries.
If we’re looking just at the countries that suffer from the most severe amounts of pollution, the data changes dramatically. In the graph below, I’m looking only at cities that are registering at above the WHO’s recommended 25 µg/m³ in the “most polluted” data.

It comes as no surprise that pollution has a choke-hold on China’s economy, with a recent report suggesting that a staggering 6.5 percent of the country’s GDP is being spent on pollution-related costs.
India is also struggling tremendously; the country has the dubious honor of claiming 13 of the 20 slots in the top most-polluted cities in the world. Only today, a  20-minute documentary entitled Death By Breath was released, exploring just how bad the air quality is in cities like Delhi, Patna and Gwalior.
What’s interesting about both of these markets is that they may just be perfect target markets for the sort of thing Tesla is trying to accomplish.
I believe that thinking “Hey, the HEPA filters make Tesla great for polluted places” is the wrong way of looking at it: It’s the other way around. Tesla was looking at the markets where it wants to make a huge splash, and added the advanced filtration precisely because these markets are struggling with severe pollution problems.
Tesla is going to sell so many cars
As I mentioned, HEPA filters in cars are nothing new, but the marketing around them has usually been subtle and understated, not to mention slightly negated by the fact that that giant, gas-chugging SUV you are driving may well have the cleanest passenger compartment in the world, but you’re still driving around and being part of the problem. By being a purely electric car company, Tesla is able to take the high road and offer something unique to an emerging class of wealthy individuals: People who care both about the air they breathe and about not being part of the problem.
In the world of luxury cars, Tesla is priced relatively averagely: There are a lot of different cars to choose from in this segment, and having a strong differentiating factor will make a tremendous different. Being an EV is only a small part of the appeal, doubly so in markets such as Beijing, Hong Kong, Delhi and Doha, where the Venn diagram of rampant pollution and concentrated wealth are at their peak.

1137,Even your connected car will need antivirus software,https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/02/even-your-connected-car-will-need-antivirus-software/,2016/05/02,"
Connected cars can talk to each other (vehicle-to-vehicle, or V2V), and they’re starting to be able to talk to the city they’re driving around (vehicle-to-infrastructure, or V2I). That also means baddies can potentially talk to our cars, as we’ve seen in the experimental hack of a Jeep. But hacking isn’t the only danger, because wherever there’s a computer, there’s certain to be a computer virus lurking.
This is the problem Argus Cyber Security is working to address. Granted, there aren’t many viruses being spread from car to car right now, since connectivity in automobiles is still new. But Argus VP Yoni Heilbronn notes in an email interview that by 2020, around 70 million of the 90 million cars projected to ship that year will be connected. While a virus on your computer means someone could steal and misuse your data, which is bad enough, when it happens in your car, there’s potential for physical harm.
That’s still no reason to give up on cars completely and commute on a big-wheeled velocipede bicycle; car companies and tech companies have been working together for a few years now to solve the problem. “There is no silver bullet to cyber security,” says Heilbronn. “You’ll want multiple ‘bullets.'” That includes security that’s baked into the hardware along with layers of software security. “If the software that is baked in is able to be updated remotely, then it is a powerful tool for a car maker or fleet manager,” Heilbronn says.
Consumers won’t necessarily know that Argus or other security software is on board their new connected car unless they ask, since it’s ultimately the auto manufacturer who is responsible for the safety and security of the vehicle. “Although the consumer may not know we’re there,” Heilbronn says, “like the Greek myth, Argus will be the watchful eyes making sure the system is doing what it is supposed to do and absolutely nothing more.” As security needs and standards change, you might soon be able to buy Argus software for your car just as you would McAfee or Kaspersky for your computer.
Aftermarket security could become important soon, since we’re already bringing all kinds of vulnerabilities into the car ourselves. Take the “dongles” that fit into the OBD II port under the dashboard. These often come from insurance companies for usage-based rates, or there are units like the Zubie I tested that tracked my driving habits and vehicle stats. These devices communicate with the outside world, which means the outside world could communicate with them.
“Since the dongle is physically connected to the automobile and to its internal network,” according to Heilbronn, “any malware that successfully breaches the dongle’s security measures or its communication link could potentially inject malicious code onto the vehicle’s CAN Bus [the protocol automobiles use to let on board microcontrollers communicate] and cause unwanted effects to vehicle operations.” Note that as of now, he still says “potentially,” so that’s encouraging.
But about two years ago, Argus did indeed find a vulnerability in a Zubie device, showing that it could be remotely attacked to take full control of the vehicle. Argus made a responsible disclosure to Zubie, which fixed the issues and announced the improvements.
Connectivity is more than just hooking your phone up to your car wirelessly (that’s another potential vulnerability, by the way). V2V and V2I communications are going to be key technologies for autonomous automobiles. Making sure those communications are trustworthy is yet another consideration to add to the conversation as we drive forward.

The exploit leverages the Waze feature that shows you nearby users, showing that the data you’re seeing is live and giving you options should you need help. The researchers created hundreds of fake driver profiles, which would keep tabs on a given real profile and track its location more or less in real time.
“We appreciate the researchers bringing this to our attention and have implemented safeguards in the past 24 hours to address the vulnerability and prevent ghost riders from affecting system behavior and performing similar tracking activities,” read the Waze blog post addressing the issue.
The company pointed out, however, that the reporter had given the researchers her username and starting location (a nice head start), and that the exploit only worked when the app was open and active — at which point your location is being shared with people around you anyway. You can also defeat the exploit by turning on “invisible mode,” which seems like the first step you’d want to take if you were worried about being tracked.
More details on the exploit and others like it will be presented by the researchers at MobiSys in June.

1139,Mercedes home batteries are a potential rival for Tesla’s Powerwall,https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/28/mercedes-home-batteries-are-a-potential-rival-for-teslas-powerwall/,2016/04/28,"
The batteries developed for the high demands of all-electric Mercedes-Benz cars are finding a new application as in-home energy storage units. Sound familiar? Yeah, it’s a lot like the Tesla Powerwall.
Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler AG announced that the storage units are being manufactured by its subsidiary Deutsche ACCUMOTIVE (Daimler has a real love of all caps). The batteries are being sold, installed and supported by partners like utility and solar tech companies. That makes sense, because the storage units are usually installed along with solar panels. The units are already available in Germany, and Mercedes says it will be expanding the program internationally.
Up to eight of the columnar 2.5 kWh lithium-ion battery modules can be combined, with a maximum capacity of 20 kWh all together. According to Mercedes, this is enough to capture surplus solar power for later use with “virtually no losses.” The price of the units hasn’t been disclosed, since it can include several components: the unit itself (or two or three), maybe some photovoltaic panels and the installation.
Deutsche ACCUMOTIVE has been making units like this since 2015 for industrial uses. The systems were designed to be scalable; thus the quick entry into the private home market. Daimler is banking on its energy storage subsidiary in a big way — it’s invested more than $500 million in a second battery factory at the Deutsche ACCUMOTIVE site that will begin operating in the summer of 2017.
As a comparison, the Tesla Energy Powerwall serves the same purpose, with arguably more style. The Powerwall has 6.4 kWh of energy storage “for daily cycle applications,” according to the website. Like the Mercedes units, these can be installed in multiples for solar systems that need to store more energy. We do know how much the Powerwall costs — $3,500. We also know that demand was high, with a reported 38,000 reservations when the Powerwall was announced last year. That level of demand seems to leave plenty of room for a competitor like Daimler AG to jump in with its road-tested battery technology this year.

1140,Jaguar partners with Tile to make sure drivers never leave without their wallets,https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/26/jaguar-partners-with-tile-to-make-sure-drivers-never-leave-without-their-wallets/,2016/04/26,"Automaker Jaguar Land Rover Ltd. today announced a partnership with Silicon Valley startup Tile Inc. to prevent drivers from leaving home, or any other place, without their essential personal items.
Tile, which has raised $16 million in total venture funding to-date, makes small, waterproof tags that employ Bluetooth low-energy radio and GPS technology to locate objects to which they are affixed.
Typically, users put Tiles on key fobs, wallets and purses, smartphone and laptop cases, gym bags and luggage.
According to Tile CEO and co-founder Mike Farley, the company has shipped more than 5 million of its tags to customers so far, who often buy four at a time.
Tile sales hit $43 million in 2015, he said, and the company expects to double that this year at least. Apple, Best Buy, Lowe’s and T-mobile stores are among retailers selling Tile.
Users have tracked items in Antarctica and outer space with Tile, Farley said. The company locates half-a-million objects daily or more.
When users lose track of something that’s tagged with a Tile, they can fire up the company’s mobile app to see if the item is within about a 100-foot range. If yes, they can make the Tile beep to guide them to items hidden from plain view.
That feature could help drivers locate an item that may have fallen under a car seat, or that were forgotten after stowage in a glove box.
A Land Rover driver uses the Tile mobile app to check for essential items before departing.
But more importantly, given its new partnership with Jaguar Land Rover, the Tile app will be featured on the “InControl Apps” menu on the 2017 Land Rover Discovery Sport, a premium compact SUV.
That’s a coveted position for an in-car app. The automaker only features about a dozen apps on its touchscreen system, including navigation and music apps.
According to Cross Car Product and Strategy Manager for Jaguar Land Rover, Tim Phillipo, drivers will be able to set up a list of essential items and check it, every time they get into their vehicles, using Tile via the company’s InControl Apps system.
Phillipo said for now customers will have to fire up the Tile app proactively to see if they’re missing anything before they drive away. But, he said, “In the next phase, you will get in your car, and when you plug in your phone, it will tell you if you don’t have something from your essentials list with you.”

The partnership marks the first such engagement for Tile, Farley said. It is non-exclusive, and Tile is hoping to become part of the app layer in the connected cars market, more broadly.
Competitors like TrackR and newcomers like Trakkies may try to follow suit. But it remains to be seen how much integrations will drive sales or engagement for makers of tags that bring locate-ability to everyday objects.

1141,"Now some Ubers will only wait 2 minutes before charging you, not 5",https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/26/no-you-cant-go-to-the-bathroom-first/,2016/04/26,"
Better sprint outside, because now Uber can ditch you if you’re just two minutes late for your ride, or start charging you before you get in the car. Previously, people got a five-minute grace period to get to the car after it arrived, or to cancel their trip after they sent a request. But now, Uber is telling some users to “Request When You’re Ready” or face fees tacked onto their ride, according to a screenshot by Sree Sreenivasan.
Uber tells me it’s running a pilot program of the new no-show policy in NYC, New Jersey, Phoenix and Dallas, and will be evaluating results over the next few weeks before deciding whether to expand it to other markets. The pilot was just paused due to a bug but will be running again very soon.
[Update: Uber says users will only be hit with a no-show fee if they don’t show up within 5 minutes of their driver arriving. But after 2 minutes of waiting, the rider will start to be charged the per minute rate for their city which will be added to their ride cost if they do get in. Drivers also incur no formal penalty for ditching passengers at any time before they get in the car.]
The problem is that Ubers actually waiting for you was one of their key advantages over taxis. If you needed to use the bathroom or grab something you forgot, or if you lived on a top floor of your building with lots of stairs or a slow elevator, your Uber’s private cars would still be there politely parked for you.
But with only two minutes of wait time, you practically have to be standing by the door or outside already to make sure you don’t miss your ride. That’s especially troubling when Uber ETAs can vary and aren’t always accurate and has cars marked as having “arrived” when they’re still a block away.
You might expect the car to take four minutes to arrive, but if it shows up in two, you could get dinged with fees. If you expect it to arrive in two minutes and it takes six because of traffic, lights, one-way streets or other delays, you’ll end up standing on the street in what doesn’t feel like the comfortable experience for which Uber has become known.
Senior citizens, the mobility impaired and parents trying to wrangle kids all might be a lot more likely to get left behind or charged. And if the driver leaves them, they’d have to wait for another Uber or other car service to send a new driver, which could make them late to their destination.
As for the change to the cancellation policy, that seems more reasonable. Two minutes is plenty of time to realize you put in the wrong address, don’t need a car after all or could get a cheaper or faster ride from another service. The five-minute cancellation window likely hurt drivers who would waste time and gas beginning to drive to someone before getting cancelled with no compensation.
You’re the one who has to UberRush
But the driver cancellation policy feels rude and unforgiving. Sure, people shouldn’t be requesting cars when they’re not even close to ready to leave, forcing drivers to burn tons of time waiting for them. Maybe five minutes was too long; but getting ditched doesn’t seem appropriate, and  two minutes feels too short to start charging people.
Uber’s perspective is that this somehow makes the experience better for riders.
The company tells me, “Drivers’ time is valuable, and while we expect riders to request a ride only once they’re ready, we know that waiting for a rider at their pickup location can be frustrating. In select cities we are running a small pilot so that drivers are compensated for their time even when riders are running a bit late or have a change of plans. When riders and drivers are respectful of each other’s time, the whole system runs more smoothly and the Uber experience improves for everyone.”
Perhaps the change could trickle down to quicker ETAs for other passengers if drivers don’t wait for you, but it really just improves Uber’s relationship with its drivers that it has to fight to keep from straying to competitors. The tiny amount of extra cash granted to the driver for waiting a few extra minutes might not incentivize patience to wait for you.
Hailed at 10:53, this UberX’s ETA was 10:56 but it actually arrived at 10:54. If the passenger showed up at the ETA, they could have missed the two-minute window, gotten ditched and been hit with a no-show fee.

Tip your Uber driver


For reference, UberPool uses different policies because delays also hurt other people in the car or those assigned to be picked up next. There’s no cancellation grace period, and UberPool drivers only wait two minutes for you once they arrive — but the penalty was only $2. Uber’s competitor, Lyft, will wait five minutes and has to contact you by phone or text before they can leave you with a $5 to $10 penalty, though its UberPool-esque Lyft Line service will only wait an aggressive one minute.
Uber is built to be reliable. Despite the hate it gets, the whole surge pricing system is designed to preserve that by discouraging demand to ensure supply. If there’s an emergency or you absolutely have to make it to a flight or meeting, you can trust there will be cars available if you’re willing to pay the surge.
Yet if you have to worry you’re going to get ditched for any unforeseen delay, Uber’s reliability is destroyed.

Google, Uber and Lyft have joined forces with automakers Volvo and Ford, creating a coalition to influence lawmakers, regulators and the public, Automotive News reported on Tuesday.
The new lobby, dubbed The Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, will be led by David Strickland, long-time safety watchdog who was formerly the head of the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
Strickland, who is currently a Partner in the regulatory group at D.C.-based law firm Venable LLP, was not immediately available for comment.
In 2014, the most recent available numbers from the NHTSA, there were 6.1 million reported crashes on U.S. roads, resulting in 2.3 million injuries and 32,675 fatalities.
The Self-Driving Coalition for Safe Streets will basically aim to influence regulations that will, of course, keep safety in mind but allow for rapid penetration of autonomous vehicle technology into the market.

1143,"Clarkson, Hammond and May to launch DriveTribe motoring content platform",https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/25/clarkson-hammond-and-may-to-launch-drivetribe-motoring-content-platform/,2016/04/25,"
In an age when completely driverless cars (probably electric) seem to be just around the corner, the idea of starting a brand new online community aimed at petrolheads seems like an ill-timed one. But that’s not about to stop Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, best known as the former presenters of the globally famous Top Gear TV show. After leaving the BBC last year, these three musketeers signed up to create a new streaming TV show for Amazon Prime. But but they also plan what they say will be a totally separate venture to create an online community for motoring enthusiasts.
Slated to launch in the Fall, DriveTribe (which has a holding site and Facebook, YouTube and Twitter presence) will be a brand new digital media platform consisting of a combination of content produced by celebrities of the motoring scene, professionally created content and that generated by users themselves. The company is co-founded by the three mentioned above together with Andy Wilman, their long-time TV collaborator, and serial tech entrepreneur Ernesto Schmitt, who recently exited Beamly.
But before you throw your hands up to declare this a content strategy from 2004, wait. The startup plans to build an engine to send content that will specifically target the disparate communities that make up car fans — from petrolheads to classic car aficionados. A versioning engine and multi-variate testing system will trial “hundreds of different versions” of content on different segments of users, defined by age, gender, location and interests, with “optimal matches” pushed directly to peoples’ social timelines through Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, etc. There will, of course, be iOS and Android apps, as well.
The idea is that punters will sign up to the “tribe” that best reflects their motoring interests, in addition to being able to create their own. The Clarkson/Hammond/May trio will of course be hosting their own “tribes” with original content.
Now, DriveTribe will have its work cut-out. Competitors include online publishing ventures, like the original TopGear online community, PistonHeads, CarThrottle, numerous Subreddits and the estimated 400 million fans of motoring already on Facebook.
Ah, but DriveTribe argues, those people are not well-served right now, and they plan to reach them with this new kind of content-targeting engine.
Richard Hammond said: “Gamers have got Twitch, travellers have got TripAdvisor and fashion fans have got, oh, something or other too. But people who are into cars have got nowhere. There’s no grand-scale online motoring community where people can meet and share video, comments, information and opinion. DriveTribe will change that. And then some.”
Schmitt, CEO of DriveTribe, said: “Automotive and adventure-lifestyle are huge growth areas for content, and are presently woefully underserved digitally. Automotive is also the biggest advertising category in the world — with $45 billion media spend projected for 2016 — and we expect our content will monetize well through native advertising and social commerce.”
DriveTribe thinks there is a big gap in the market, with (they say) 428 million people on Facebook with a self-declared like of motoring — slightly smaller than Movies and Entertainment, which are the number 1 category. Additionally, cars are a bigger interest category than News & Current Affairs (410 million), Football (380 million) or Pets, Dating and Toys combined. At the same time, not one of the top 500 websites globally is dedicated to cars.
Schmitt was previously founder and CEO of Beamly (sold 2015), peoplesound.com (sold 2001) and executive chair of Invision, sold to Intel in 2012. He has brought on board Jonathan Morris as CTO, who was previously CTO of The Financial Times online and Thompson Reuters, as well as co-founder of two fintech ventures. DriveTribe will be based in London’s Kings Cross.
So is this like “Tidal for Petrolheads” where car stars will be bringing their loyal fan base to the party? Not really, says Schmitt. He says Tidal was trying to solve a perceived problem with royalty collection where none existed, but DriveTribe is solving a supply-side problem.
The team is starting with 20 product and engineer people, but plans to scale up to 60 by the launch.
Hammond told me that talk about a coming future of driverless cars deadening our desire for motoring is wrong-headed. And that, in fact, the innovation happening around cars will actually “drive” DriveTribe.
“The historical urge for speed still is primal. That will never go away. If anything it’s heightening. There will be entirely new forms of motoring. And there’s the tribal nature of motoring… We will still use cars to demonstrate our power and potency. It’s a hugely exciting times for motoring. The need for people to have their own platform is greater than ever before. Manufactures are, thank goodness, once again making mistakes because they are pushing the boundaries. Twenty years ago manufacturers were not making mistakes, just changing bits of fascia. Now it’s all about innovation,” he said.
Schmitt said the model for their content distribution will be “50% technology and 50% content. But the tech stack is world-class. We will invest same proportion into R&D as we do into content.”
He also said the company will look at extending the model into other verticals, which could include fashion, music or food.
However, he may come up against the issue of aggregation as a business model. All online media and content is fragmented, a problem which was solved by search engines and social media. Thus, customers may not see it as a problem in the first place, and nor, perhaps, will media buyers.
Although Schmitt and Hammond insisted to me that DriveTribe will be separate from the Amazon Prime show, there remains the possibility that it may have a similar name — over which the trio have been racking their brains apparently.
Meanwhile, James May added: “This is pure digital inclusivity. Some of the world’s most endangered tribes — Volvo enthusiasts, for example — will now have a voice as loud as everyone else’s.”
UPDATE: It now transpires that DriveTribe will be based on the 6tribes platform created by former Beamly co-founder Anthony Rose, who obviously worked closely with Schmitt. DriveTribe says that it acquired 6tribes earlier this year, and now owns the IP. “Drivetribe will develop the proposition, and add more to it ahead of launch later this year,” said a spokesperson.

1144,Honda and Volvo add more electrification,https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/25/honda-and-volvo-add-more-electrification/,2016/04/25,"
Honda announced it’s going to expand its Clarity line to include an all-electric version and a plug-in hybrid next year. The latest version of the Honda Clarity will be available later this year any way you want it, as along as you want a fuel-cell vehicle. The other two variants will be ready in 2017.
Honda’s goal is to have electrified vehicles, including plug-in hybrids and fuel cells, account for two-thirds of its total sales by 2030. Right now, you can buy a Honda Fit EV or an Accord Hybrid, so adding two more models nearly doubles Honda’s electrified offerings, to be Pollyanna-ish about it.
Keep in mind that all three Clarity versions are still niche vehicles. Fuel-cell vehicles are pretty much restricted to southern California, where there’s infrastructure to support the new technology. All-electric vehicles have a bit more reach, as many metro areas in the United States are expanding charging infrastructure, but that change is slow in coming. Plug-in hybrids have the most potential for reaching the heartland, as there’s a regular gasoline engine to fall back on after a few miles of all-electric travel. Errands and short commutes can be completed almost entirely on electric power in most plug-in hybrids, but if you live in Montana or Kansas, you’re going to be glad you have a gasoline engine on board.
On the same day, Volvo announced it will have two hybrid versions of every vehicle in its fleet, and it will release its first fully electric vehicle in 2019. In the press release, company president Hakan Samuelsson said, “Volvo wants to be at the forefront of this shift to electrification.” Given that so many other manufacturers already have at least one hybrid model, if not several, on the road, and there are a dozen or more electric vehicles a person could choose from right now in 2016, that “forefront” ship has already sailed.
Volvo is not known for moving quickly and providing a lot of flash, though, so it’s not out of corporate character to spend years preparing for a change this huge. They’ve created two vehicle architectures — one large, one small — that can be fitted with either a hybrid, plug-in hybrid or electric powertrain. The first vehicle to get the electrification treatment is the XC90 T8 Twin Engine SUV, which will be available soon, with the S90 full-size sedan to follow. Volvo’s goal is to have 1 million electrified vehicles on the road by 2025 — the same year the company hopes to be climate neutral.

1145,Tip your Uber driver,https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/22/tip-your-uber-driver/,2016/04/22,"
Tip your Uber driver. Don’t argue, just do it.
Uber doesn’t include any kind of gratuity in the cost of your ride. And it doesn’t just pay drivers more to make up for that. The company implied that it did by saying there was no need to tip, and by simply not including the option to tip. The narrative is predicated on a deliberate omission.
No one questioned it, partly because it tallied with the white-knight persona, the slaying of the evil cab companies and the victory of clever technology over a dinosaur of the 20th century. Tipping was an anachronism, only necessary because of how poorly cabbies were paid. So in the new Uber era: no tipping necessary.
Uber drivers make about $15-20 per hour on average, then have to pay for their own maintenance and gas after Uber takes its 20% cut. That’s not a bad wage, plus the flexible hours are nice, but it’s not great either, and it’s not like they’re going to get regular merit raises. But that’s all kind of beside the point.
Tips are an unfortunate relic of (among other things) the longstanding and ongoing underpayment of people in the service industry, but for now they’re also the reality. People working at jobs where their employers don’t provide adequate support — good wages, benefits, equity, expenses — often must rely on the unofficial and unreliable tip system to make ends meet.
Uber drivers fall under that category, since the service is no different from other car services where tipping is standard, but the company’s narrative and the app itself are designed to exclude them from the tip process in order to give the service the illusion of economy. It’s shameful, really.

David Plouffe to talk at Disrupt NY about his move from the White House to Uber strategic adviser


How much to tip, how it would work with ratings, the etiquette involved, these are secondary issues — and ones already being worked out by services that allow tips, like Lyft. First you have to acknowledge that if you can afford to take an Uber, you can afford to tip your driver, and that you really should. Just like you can afford to tip if you can buy a $5 coffee, or a $20 lunch. (Personally, I believe it’s part of the social contract in which we all take part, but that’s a broader discussion for another time.)
I know it’s not easy, because part of the reason you use the app is so you don’t have to carry cash, and because tipping is old hat. Blame Uber for not including the option and for telling you there’s “no need to tip.” Well, of course there’s no need. There’s no need to tip anyone. You’re just a dick if you don’t, since, until employers stop treating their workers as adversaries and obfuscating the actual cost of a product or service, you’re on the hook to make up the difference.
Don’t like it? Me neither. But don’t take it out on the driver, or the barista, or the waiter, or the cook, or the cleaner, or the mover, by not tipping. If you really want to broadcast your disappointment with the situation, support businesses that are doing right by their employees, and decline to support businesses that aren’t. (I don’t use Uber, myself, and maybe you shouldn’t either. There are plenty of options to choose from.)
One of the unfortunate dark sides of the gig/1099 economy is this: if the price seems too good to be true, the company isn’t paying for it — the worker is. Who better to subsidize the price than the people who have no choice in the matter, since the alternative is often no job at all? It’s exploitative, and you should be suspicious of every business model that drags its workers with it on a race to the bottom.
Exceptions are conspicuous (and meritorious): companies like Honor and Rinse make waves just with the uncontroversial action of making their employees W-2s. It behooves companies claiming to be progressive to enact progressive policies.
Cutting out middlemen, fighting entrenched legislation and established players, leveraging instant connectivity, these are all great things. I congratulate Uber on its conquest. I don’t think it’s evil, but it sure isn’t on the side of the angels, either. Tech is supposed to be a rising tide that lifts all boats.
Until that happens, tip your Uber driver.

1146,Elon Musk has an idea for autonomous transit vehicles but he’s being coy about it,https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/21/elon-musk-has-an-idea-for-autonomous-transit-vehicles-but-hes-being-coy-about-it/,2016/04/21,"
Elon Musk has a plan to solve the traffic crisis in our cities. A vague, secret plan. He may not actually have a plan. But he did say something out loud in public about it, and he doesn’t usually do that unless he has at least kind of a plan.
Bloomberg reports that, speaking at a transport conference in Norway, Musk’s fecund imagination briefly overflowed. “We have an idea for something which is not exactly a bus but would solve the density problem for inner city situations,” he said. “I don’t want to talk too much about it. I have to be careful what I say.”

He also said that “there’s a new type of car or vehicle that would be great for that and that’ll actually take people to their final destination and not just the bus stop,” adding that “autonomous vehicles are key.”
I could speculate about what it is, but — actually, why not?
A “new type of car or vehicle” that “is not exactly a bus” but would drop you off where you’re going. So it uses city streets, isn’t quite a car, and benefits especially from autonomy.
To me, that sounds like an 8-10 passenger EV that automatically picks up and drops off multiple users on shared routes. This would be something about the size of an airport parking shuttle, with room to stand and stash your suitcase or bags of groceries. For longer rides they could even hook up for aerodynamism and (why not?) allow people to switch cars — a true road train. Smaller vehicles that hook up with others into a little autonomous vehicular centipede might also be a possibility.
Of course, no one really likes shuttles, because they make so many damn stops. But if the route and passengers were carefully calculated according to citywide efficiency systems, it wouldn’t be so bad. Anyway, that’s my guess.
The only person who really knows is Musk and whoever he’s spilled the beans to. The best thing to do now is to alternately badger and butter up this genius billionaire until he publishes a big paper on it. Worked for the Hyperloop!
“I wish I had not mentioned it,” he said at the time, in an interview with Businessweek. “I still have to run SpaceX and Tesla, and it’s fucking hard.”

1147,"Beepi lets you buy, sell and now lease a car with an app",https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/21/beepi-lets-you-buy-sell-and-now-lease-a-car-with-an-app/,2016/04/21,"
There are lots of apps that help you research prices for buying or selling a car, and they’ll even hook you up with a dealership when you’re ready to buy. But Beepi lets you buy and sell used cars in 16 metro areas in nine states without using a dealership — or a test drive — at all.
“Every company starts with a group of entrepreneurs who think something is true but it disagrees with what everyone else thinks,” said Beepi founder Alejandro Resnik in a phone interview. “My belief was that there was this whole infrastructure of cars sitting on lots for one reason: to do a test drive.” He found that while most people would not buy a used car without a test drive, they warmed up to the idea if the car was inspected, came with a money-back guarantee and was from a brand they trusted. “That was the initial light bulb,” Resnik said.
So how do you buy a car with an app but without testing it? “The same way you buy anything online,” Resnik said. You find a car you like at a price that works for your budget and buy it. A Beepi representative goes to the seller, gives her the money and delivers the car to you. Then you get what Beepi calls a 10-day test drive. If the car doesn’t work out for you, you get your money back.
Each car goes through a 240-point inspection by professional, trained Beepi representatives who are both shareholders in the company and employees. They’re certified mechanics to begin with, and they undergo an additional three months of Beepi-specific training. When you want to sell your car through Beepi, an inspector will visit to check everything. They use a camera to look under the chassis, they take 200 pictures and they do a dynamic test drive to listen for weird noises, test normal braking and acceleration, and check the alignment. It’s a test drive done the way a pro would do it, Resnik said, rather than a consumer just trying to understand the noises they hear.
He should know — he took a test drive of a used vehicle that burst into flames two days after he drove it home. When he was on the car lot, Resnik said, “I spoke with the dealer; he was a nice guy. I did a test drive. I thought I knew about machines. The engine looked amazing, the suspension looked amazing, the brakes looked amazing.” In trying to get his money back (and eventually succeeding), Resnik learned a lot about consumer protection laws and the process of buying and selling cars.
He also counts himself as an older millennial, a generation that’s used to showrooming and cross-shopping online. “Car buying and selling starts online, using KBB.com or Edmunds or AutoTrader,” Resnik said, “but when you get to the interesting part, you need to close your computer.” It also eliminates the ick factor of meeting strangers via Craigslist or dealing with used car salesmen. “Dealerships remain a scary place for women and minorities,” Resnik said. “Beepi is enabling a market that was hidden because those people were not transacting. This way, the market becomes larger and more connected.”
Part of expanding the market is offering a streamlined financing process. Beepi has partnered with Chase and credit unions to offer traditional financing and, as of this morning, Ally Financial to offer leasing. You can even pay for the entire car with a credit card or Bitcoin.
With Beepi, “there’s no break between online research and online buying,” said Resnik. “You start the process online and finish online. That gives us the advantage.”

1148,"In Europe, Ford will read the speed limit signs, prevent your speeding",https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/21/slow-down-there-hamilton/,2016/04/21,"
Good news for those of us with a fast car, a lead foot and poor impulse control: Ford is rolling out a new Speed Limiter feature. The car uses a camera to read the speed limit signs before giving you a heads up if your velocity is making you a police-magnet.
Whoa, there, Jack. Take ‘er easy.
For now, the technology is only being rolled out on the company’s European line of cars, including the Edge, Galaxy and S-MAX vehicles. The Euro-market is a particularly good match for the technology, given that there are more than 35,000 speed cameras across Europe, and speeding tickets turning up in the mail is practically a national sport across much of the continent. Smile for the camera, indeed.
It’s yet another tiny piece of the self-driving car puzzle falling into place. In this case, in a car with the Intelligent Speed Limiter activated, a camera will read traffic signs ahead, adjusting the car’s speed without the driver needing to get involved. If the car you’re driving has a navigation package, it will augment the camera data with the speed limit data from the maps. Clever.

In effect, the speed nanny combines two technologies into the new, wallet-saving feature. The first is an adjustable speed limiter, which is a bit like cruise control, but instead of keeping your car at a fixed speed, it lets you drive normally but prevents you from going faster than your set speed limit. The second — and, frankly, more interesting — technology is traffic sign recognition, which shows you right on your dashboard the most recent passing restrictions, speed limit signs and other information.
You can see the technology in action in the video below.

If Apple really is working on a car, it won’t be the Ultimate Driving Machine™. BMW and Daimler have discontinued talks with Apple over a potential automotive collaboration, Handelsblatt reports.
Things fell apart (last year for BMW, more recently with Daimler) over questions of leadership and ownership, the German newspaper’s source said — and given what we know about Apple, that seems like a perfectly likely sticking point. The idea of integrating the car closely with Apple services rather than their own may have rattled the car makers; of course, automotive brands are among the most powerfully guarded and promoted in the world.

Rumors swirled about a year ago around the idea of an Apple Car, and recent hires have been more than suggestive.

One thing everyone is sure of, though: with hundreds of employees working on the project, whatever it is, it isn’t just a hobby.
So who’s left for Apple to work with? The latest rumors point to Magna, a Canadian-Austrian specialty electric vehicle maker that works with multiple badges to produce limited editions and one-offs. With top-shelf cred, less brand jealousy and probably less-demanding terms, Magna sounds like a good match for a well-heeled dilettante like Apple.

1150,"Tesla Model X owners finding car doors won’t shut, windows won’t close",https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/20/tesla-model-x-owners-finding-car-doors-wont-shut-windows-wont-close/,2016/04/20,"
Earlier this month, Tesla Motors recalled 2,700 Model X cars to fix a third-row seat latch that could allow the seat to fold forward during a collision.
But owners of the $138,000 sport utility vehicle — whose many features include falcon-wing doors, a 200-plus-mile battery range and proximity sensors that prevent it from coming into contact with other cars — are being confronted with more immediately irksome issues, including car doors that suddenly won’t shut and windows that won’t close.
The WSJ reported on the issue yesterday, spotlighting several Model X owners who’ve been taken aback by unexpected malfunctions, including one customer whose falcon-wing doors wouldn’t open as she prepared to drive her children’s carpool to school. “It’s a bummer,” she told the outlet. “You spent all this money . . . and the doors won’t open.”
Consumer Reports also published a lengthy piece yesterday about unhappy customers, including Michael Karpf, a 75-year-old retiree who picked up his Model X from Tesla’s Fremont, Ca., factory earlier this month, only to be faced with a string of problems with the car. Among them: falcon wing doors that wouldn’t close and proximity sensors that failed to sense an overhang, allowing the doors to bang into it. Karpf also said that the huge infotainment screen in his Model X has repeatedly frozen.
A company spokesperson sent us a statement about the glitches earlier, writing: “We are committed to making the world’s most reliable cars. While we have seen some issues with early Model X builds, the issues are not widespread, and we are working closely with each owner to respond quickly and proactively to address any problems. We will continue to do so until each customer is fully satisfied. This commitment is one of the reasons why 98% of our customers say they will buy another Tesla as their next car.”
If the company could work even faster, venture capitalist Byron Deeter of Bessemer Venture Partners would probably appreciate it. He tells us he’s been having usability problems for some time, jokingly referring to them as “a series of first-world issues.”

My @TeslaMotors X is freaking out too! Driver door & passenger windows won’t close & emergency brake goes off when backing up. #softwarefail
— Byron Deeter (@bdeeter) April 20, 2016

Deeter says the problems were minor to start. “There were issues with autopilot [not working exactly as advertised] and the driver-side door not opening when you walked up to it.”
Given the car’s many ongoing enhancements, Deeter looked at them as “little glitches, normal growing pains.”
Those pains worsened last week, however. By then, the driver-side door wouldn’t open at all, and neither would the car’s falcon-wing doors on the driver’s side. (Deeter and his family have been entering through the car’s passenger side and sliding across.)
By this past Monday night, not only could Deeter not open his car door, but it wouldn’t close. “I could manually pull it closed, but it wouldn’t latch.” In fact, after trying numerous approaches and trying to work through the car’s software controls, Deeter found himself driving to a board meeting with one hand on the steering wheel and one holding shut the driver-side door. “It wasn’t terribly smart, but I didn’t have time to call an Uber.”
Then things got worse. This morning, says Deeter, his door wouldn’t open. The car’s driver-side window wouldn’t close. And far worse, when he tried reversing out of his driveway despite these things, the car’s emergency brake sprang into action every six feet or so. “I’d put it in park, back it up, then the car would be brought to a stop.”
The car is now in his garage. “I’ll deal with it later,” he says with a laugh.
Deeter is a software fanatic who’s largely willing to put up with the issues that come with being an early adopter (though he suggests he has sent some emails to Tesla that have yet to receive a response). “I’m a believer that tech is the path forward, and I’m quite looking forward to autonomous vehicles,” he tells us.
Still, he notes, putting up with a glitch with a new entertainment device is one thing; it’s a rather different story when the newest gadget to fail you is your car.
“It’s definitely a reminder that quality control with human mobility and safety is critical,” says Deeter. “In this case, Tesla did push out some software and maybe some hardware that wasn’t quite ready for prime time.”

1151,"LeEco wheels out its own self-driving electric concept car, following deals with Faraday Future and Aston Martin",https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/20/leeco-concept-car/,2016/04/20,"
If you know LeEco at all, it’s likely for the Chinese company’s smartphones. Or, maybe you’ve caught wind of its video streaming services or smart televisions — it was known as LeTV until fairly recently, after all.
Those elements were present in a massive Beijing press conference held earlier today (including a trio of new smartphones that have done away with the headphone jack, in favor of USB-C), but the true highlight came when a visibly emotional CEO Jia Yueting unveiled the LeSEE concept car.
Following a fittingly dramatic promo video loaded with gratuitous shots of the concept car’s curves, Yueting hailed it on his phone using voice recognition, a nod to the company’s plan to market the LeSEE as a sort of futuristic, autonomous taxi.
Company co-founder Ding Lei offered the public its first peek as he drove it out on stage at a speed only appropriate in school zones and press conferences. Choking back and later apologizing for his tears, Yueting then ordered the car to go back and park itself.
The car-gawking public will get a closer look at the LeSEE (pronounced, fittingly, similarly to “lessee”) at the upcoming Beijing Auto Show — though the company did offer up some interesting tidbits about the autonomous concept vehicle, including a top speed of 130 MPH, an exterior display on the front of the car and a foldaway steering wheel.
There also looks to be a fairly impressive on-board entertainment system, featuring back-of-seat displays and isolated music playback, so passengers can listen to different things at the same time.
All of this comes as stories roll in about that other consumer electronics maker that has apparently been steadily toiling away on an electric car of its own for some time. It shouldn’t be a complete shock that LeEco got there first, however. The company has, after all, already dipped multiple toes in the water, both through its backing of Faraday Future’s buzzworthy concept and a joint venture with Aston Martin announced back in February.

1152,ABI Research predicts no more night vision for vehicles,https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/18/abi-research-predicts-no-more-night-vision-for-vehicles/,2016/04/18,"
Technology market analysts at ABI Research predict that advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are going to be big business in the next decade — to the tune of $132 billion. But they also predict the decline and fall of night vision in our cars.
Night vision systems have been available for vehicles since the early 2000s. They use either infrared or thermographic cameras to scan the dark road ahead for people or animals and alert the driver to the problem. ABI Research calls this vulnerable user detection, or VUD. Some systems show the outline of the pedestrian in the center console screen or a heads-up display, or the system might just show a warning in the dashboard to tell the driver there’s something out there to watch for.
The 2016 Mercedes-Benz S-Class, for instance, has Night Vision Assist Plus, which uses both thermal and infrared imaging to display in the instrument cluster a real-time view of the road. It also scans for pedestrians and animals along the side of the road (whitetail deer, I’m looking at you — thermographically) and will flash the headlights to let pedestrians know there’s a car coming.
This seems pretty cool, but ABI Research notes that it’s not as cool — or as useful and forward-thinking — as the ADAS tech that’s becoming more available. The idea behind things like automatic emergency braking (AEB) and the related VUD systems is that the car’s cameras and sensors will take in this information and act on it before the driver even realizes there’s a problem. Rather than taking the time to show you the outline of a pedestrian and wait for you to brake, the car will just do it. AEB will be in all new cars starting in 2022, and companies like Honda and Toyota are rolling it out widely, even in inexpensive models.
Analyst James Hodgson said in an ABI Research statement, “Within the next decade, the focus will migrate away from augmenting driver perception and toward sensors that can enable autonomous control for both navigation and emergency collision avoidance. Therefore, there will be a limited need for car OEMs to provide a system that allows the human driver or car occupant to see in the dark.”
Given that Ford’s autonomous test car just navigated desert roads in the dark and without a human at the wheel, Hodgson makes a good point. Technology is going to move away from getting the driver’s attention and toward taking over quickly and, we hope, correctly.

1153,Gestigon and Renault know if you’re ready to take the wheel,https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/13/gestigon-and-renault-know-if-youre-ready-to-take-the-wheel/,2016/04/13,"
Between the current advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and the future, the completely autonomous car rests in some potentially treacherous semi-autonomous territory. Renault has enlisted the help of gesture-control experts at gestigon to help ease the transition from vehicles taking care of driving tasks to humans taking over driving duties.
This transition is more difficult than you might imagine. When vehicles reach SAE Level 4, they can do most of the driving themselves, but will still require human drivers to take over in tricky or unpredictable situations. But if the vehicle has been cruising along without any input from the driver, the driver may not be fully ready to drive.
“Just think about all the things you might be doing in a self-driving car and then the situation that the external sensors recognize that the driver needs to take over control in a 3-4 seconds, e.g. due to a crash on the highway or cattle crossing the countryside road,” said gestigon co-founder and CEO Moritz v. Grotthuss in an email interview.
“If you have a coffee mug in your hands, that might be possible. A laptop might be more fragile. Newspapers? You might have put the back of the seat in a lying position and you can’t even reach the steering wheel. You might not be in the driver seat at all, or breast-feeding, or sleeping, or wearing VR glasses. The car needs to know if you are able to take over control or not!”
There are vehicles on the road today that monitor driver awareness, usually via cameras that provide a 2D image. Gestigon uses depth sensors that tell the system the distance from the lens to each pixel. Grotthuss said it works like the Xbox Kinect in that way.
“Skin color, noisy background, light conditions, etc. don’t matter,” with this technology, he said. “You get the same results in bright sunlight as well as the darkest night.”

While gestigon’s technology can track just about anything a person does, in this particular application with Renault, the focus is on the seating position of the driver.
“What are they doing? Where is their head and where are they looking? Where are their arms and hands? Do they have an object in their hands?,” he explains. All of these factors will tell the vehicle if the driver is prepared to actually drive.
Renault and gestigon aren’t yet saying when this 3D mapping of drivers will be available in vehicles, but the transition of power from vehicle to human is going to be an important safety hurdle to clear as cars become more — but not entirely — autonomous in the near future.

1154,Nauto raises $12 million for driverless car technology that’s street-legal today,https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/13/nauto-raises-12-million-for-driverless-car-technology-thats-street-legal-today/,2016/04/13,"
Even before the blockbuster acquisition of Cruise Automation by General Motors for more than $1 billion, venture firms were looking for big ideas in autonomous vehicles.
The latest company to attract a round of funding for driverless car technology is Palo Alto-based NAUTO, co-founded in 2015 by CEO Stefan Heck and CTO Frederick Soo.
Andy Rubin’s hardware focused venture fund, Playground Global, led the $12 million investment in Nauto, joined by Draper Nexus.
Heck explained, “Our systems today help humans drive better, safer, smarter and faster in terms of avoiding congestion and traffic. They retrofit into existing cars, and eventually will enable true autonomy in new or older vehicles.”
While early smart car tech firms, including Google, used expensive, LiDar sensors to visually learn what’s going on around a vehicle, Nauto uses the type of image sensors found in “pro-sumer” cameras, in conjunction with motion sensors, GPS systems and other affordable components to gain situational awareness.
Nauto’s Android app.
Merging artificial intelligence with dashcams, Nauto’s systems detect what’s happening on the road ahead of a driver, and within their vehicle. The system alerts drivers when there’s a problem ahead, or a dangerous distraction within, to help them avoid collisions.
Nauto also automatically understands when a collision is about to happen, and records the scene inside and outside of the car then.
Images and data about the incident are stored in the cloud, and can be shared with a fleet manager or driver via Nauto’s mobile app, which proves handy for resolving questions of liability.
Nauto is selling to commercial fleets today.
“We believe if you want to accelerate the transition to make the benefits of autonomous vehicles available to people, you have to upgrade existing cars and not wait for a fleet to turn over to something completely new,” Heck said.
Nauto’s pilot customers include City Wide Taxi in San Francisco and fleets in 23 cities, internationally. But Nauto is keeping other client projects under wraps, for now.
Tapping into commercial fleets, Nauto’s system “drives” many miles, gathering data all along the way about driver behavior, good and bad.
The company hopes to gain the deepest possible understanding of what causes near-misses, scrapes and accidents at every level, and to deliver insights back to cities that can help them tweak traffic and even street design to eliminate fatal accidents.
Playground’s Bruce Leak said the Series A investment should help Nauto ramp up manufacturing, and commercial deployments with fleets and cities, while also developing next-generation products.
Leak said, “For fleet operators it is about improving safety, decreasing accidents and saving money. Insurance of the vehicles in their fleets is quite high compared to consumers.”
But long-term, he said, investors expect Nauto to evolve its systems into “the brains” that will fully control driverless cars of every kind.

This is the new Tesla Model S. And it looks like a Model S, but slightly different — gone is the false grille. The new Model S features a Model X-like nose, in line with the recently announced Model 3. Instead, Tesla has opted for a subtle mustache-like black T like the one on the Model X.
But the company didn’t stop there. The tail lights have been slightly updated as well. This change isn’t as daring, but the tail lights have darker areas.
Under the hood, Tesla is adding a couple of new features. The Model S will be getting the HEPA air filtration system from the Model X. The charger will also be faster at 48 amps instead of 40 amps.

1156,Americans are afraid of autonomous cars,https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/11/americans-are-afraid-of-autonomous-cars/,2016/04/11,"
In January of this year, AAA conducted a phone survey of nearly 2,000 drivers over the age of 18 and found some surprising results: 75 percent of respondents “would be afraid to allow an autonomous vehicle to drive itself with them in it.” Another 20 percent were cool with the idea, leaving 5 percent who are apparently abstaining in favor of waiting for flying cars.
We’ve got a few years to adjust to the idea of fully autonomous vehicles like Google’s test car driving us around without any human input. In the meantime, we do have advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), which are semi-autonomous, coming to market as we speak. About half of the respondents in AAA’s survey trusted lane-departure warning and lane-keeping systems, as well as adaptive cruise control. Only 44 percent trusted the automatic emergency braking systems that will be included on all new models by 2022, and a mere 36 percent trusted self-parking systems.
Not surprisingly, people who already have these systems in their cars are far more likely to trust them. The numbers jump by 25-30 percentage points for respondents who have used the technology in their own vehicles; for instance, 84 percent of people with lane keeping trust it, versus 50 percent of those who don’t have it in their cars.
While fully autonomous vehicles still worry most of us, we do want the ADAS features mentioned above in our next cars if we don’t have them now, according to the survey. But we don’t all want these features for the same reasons. Baby boomers cited safety as their reason for wanting semi-autonomous technology, while millennials wanted convenience and the latest technology. Interestingly, women were more likely to say they wanted these features to help reduce stress.
For those grumpy holdouts against even ADAS tech, more than 8 in 10 said it was because they are better drivers than any robot overlord. (The AAA study on parallel parking would beg to differ with these folks.) Another big slice of the respondent pie, especially younger drivers and drivers with kids of their own, said they didn’t want to pay extra for the technology. And women were more likely to cite not knowing enough about the technology or worrying that it would be too complicated.
No matter how worried people are today, these systems are going to become more and more common. As the survey shows, once drivers have experience with ADAS features, they trust them more. Once you trust lane keeping, it’s a short hop to trusting parallel parking systems. And from there, it’s only a matter of time before we’re comfortable watching VR movies in a vehicle without a steering wheel.

Tesla is voluntarily recalling 2,700 of its Model X vehicles over a flaw in the third-row seat that may be dangerous in an accident. In the meantime, the company has advised owners via email that they should not use the third row seat until it is replaced.
The issue was discovered while doing seat strength tests ahead of releasing the Model X in the European market, a Tesla spokesperson told TechCrunch in an email. It seems the locking hinge that allows the rear seat to fold forward could fail, causing the seat back to go down during a crash. That hasn’t happened in the wild, fortunately, and Tesla is issuing the recall to make sure it never does.

1158,Ford tests Lidar-equipped car in pitch darkness,https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/11/ford-lidar-autonomous-car/,2016/04/11,"
The initial goal of self-driving cars is to make them as good as human drivers — but Ford has another trick up its sleeve to nudge things to the next level. By using Lidar, Ford recently showed that its autonomous vehicles can drive in complete darkness without human intervention. In the process, they remind us that the self-driving car is about a lot more than as-good-as-humans: It’s about harnessing tech to make cars far safer and smarter than human drivers.
Self-driving cars aren’t a new phenomenon, but one key advantage that took a long time to sink in is the realization that by letting a robot drive a car, you aren’t trying to create a human to drive a car for you. It goes far beyond that: The field of robotics has a lot more toys in its tool chest than those of a mere human.
A car wearing night-vision goggles. Now I really have seen everything.
This jumped into crisp relief especially well in Ford’s recent test at its Arizona Proving Ground. The company rigged up one of its self-driving cars with Lidar technology, which combines lasers with 3D mapping and distance-sensing technology. Lidar is, in essence, radar done with laser.
“Thanks to Lidar, the test cars aren’t reliant on the sun shining, nor cameras detecting painted white lines on the asphalt,” says Jim McBride, Ford technical leader for autonomous vehicles. “Lidar allows autonomous cars to drive just as well in the dark as they do in the light of day.”
“I”m sorry, Dave, I can’t do that.” — Captain HAL, reporting for duty.
“Inside the car, I could feel it moving, but when I looked out the window, I only saw darkness,” recounts Wayne Williams, a Ford research scientist and engineer who rode in the car with the computer at the proverbial steering wheel, a feat that shows extraordinary faith in your own technology.

Driving a car around in the pitch dark would be perilous in real life, of course: Headlights are as much about being seen as they are about seeing the road in front of you. Having a chance to see the technology in action is quite magical, and to me, the key innovation is that the car is taking a step into the realm of augmented reality. Well, to the degree that a robot has a concept of a non-augmented reality, that is.
By using available technologies like computer vision, Lidar, radar, GPS, traffic reports and other data sources, seeing autonomous cars combining all its resources for increased safety is very exciting. Whereas a human driver is limited to his eyes and ears when driving, an autonomous car can — and should — use whatever sensory data it has available.
The video in particular highlights that it is still early days, but it also serves as a reminder that we are rolling into the future, autonomous inch by autonomous inch.

1159,"As on-demand startups fizzle, Zirx moves cars for other companies, not individuals",https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/11/as-on-demand-startups-fizzle-zirx-moves-cars-for-other-companies-not-individuals/,2016/04/11,"
Zirx was originally created as an app that let individuals order valet parking service, on-demand. But facing crushing costs, the San Francisco startup recently shifted its focus to the “mobility” needs of businesses.
Now, Zirx gives companies free-to-use software, called the Zirx Mobility Services platform, that they can use to have their vehicles moved around in time to get any given job done.
Clients of Zirx include car repair booking site Openbay and BAMA Commercial Leasing.
According to CEO Sean Behr, Zirx is also targeting auto shops, dealerships and auto manufacturers, who would otherwise have to build a workforce and software of their own to deliver “white-glove” services to customers.
“Not many car dealers today in the US can deliver a car to and from a customer, easily. And a lot of repair shops don’t offer pick up and deliver at all,” he said.
Besides moving cars from A to B, Zirx will also take them for an oil change or other maintenance service, gas or charge up the vehicles, and have them washed, depending on what a client has ordered.
Pricing is per mile, minute and service rendered with no surge pricing, Behr said.
Clients can log in to Zirx’s software and specify a job, like moving five cars from an uptown location to a downtown address by a certain time. They get a quote back instantly saying what the job would cost using how many Zirx agents.
The agents, or the workers who do the actual moving of the vehicles are background-checked and certified by Zirx.
The startup runs shuttle buses of agents around to do jobs, and optimizes their schedules so they land someplace close enough to walk or take public transportation to their next job if need be.
Zirx is now operating in eight cities: San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, San Diego, New York, Boston, Washington, D.C. and Chicago.
Zirx’s unveiling of its b2b software comes after several on-demand parking concepts failed, including valet services Caarbon and Vatler.
Another formerly on-demand parking startup, Valet Anywhere, is still in business but has shifted its focus to long-term, scheduled parking.
Contrastingly Luxe just raised a $50 million round of venture funding from Hertz for its combination of pre-scheduled and on-demand services.
