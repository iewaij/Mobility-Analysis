1,Samsung Galaxy Note 4 refurbished batteries get recalled due to overheating concerns,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/16/samsung-galaxy-note-4-refurbished-batteries-get-recalled-due-to-overheating-concerns/,2017/08/16,"
This is probably the last bit of news Samsung wanted to pop up in headlines in the weeks leading up to the Note 8 launch. Though, to be fair, this latest battery recall isn’t actually on Samsung. 
The US Consumer Product Safety Commission has issued a recall for refurbished Galaxy Note 4 batteries. While the news has undeniable echoes of last year’s massive Note 7 disaster, this time out, the fault appears to fall at the feet of potentially counterfeited batteries supplied by FedEx. 
As the company noted in a statement to TechCrunch, “FedEx Supply Chain handles more than the transportation of these devices. We deliver technology-based solutions for customers that include repair, refurbishment and testing.”
The batteries in question were installed in refurbished AT&T Note 4 units. The scale is much smaller than last year’s issues, impacting a little over 10,000 units, and thus far no injuries or property damage has been reported. Instead, there’s only a single case of overheating resulting from the non-OEM batteries. The fact that the Note 4 has a user-replaceable battery should help the whole thing go a bit more smoothly, as well. 
FedEx will be mailing out a new battery identified with a green dot to users who got a replacement Note 4 as part of an AT&T insurance program between last December and this past April. The company is also mailing out a pre-paid box to send back the old battery. 
“We are closely engaged with our customers to make sure all of these lithium batteries are safely and quickly returned, and will replace those lithium batteries free of charge for consumers,” the company said in a statement provided to TechCrunch. “FedEx Supply Chain places a high priority on the safe handling, packaging, and transport of our customers’ products and regrets any inconvenience this recall may cause.”
FedEx would not provide any more information regarding the origin of the batteries in question.

2,Mophie’s MacBook-charging battery pack is indispensable but overpriced,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/09/mophies-macbook-charging-battery-pack-is-indispensable-but-overpriced/,2017/08/09,"
Every time we do a gift guide here, one editor suggests the same thing: external battery packs. Every time, like clockwork. And it’s true, everyone in your life probably needs one. We all wander through our days tempting fate by porting around gadgets with sub-par battery life.
The other big upside of gifting a power bank: they’re generally pretty inexpensive. Though that certainly doesn’t apply here — the Powerstation USB-C XXL is $150. And as its name implies, it’s pretty big as far as power banks go — at roughly the size of of an iPhone 7+ and about twice as thick.

Still, it manages to pack a lot of power into that footprint. At 19,500mAh, the Powerstation has a battery nearly seven times the size of the 7+. This is all overkill for phones, but the brick can also be used to charge a laptop. In the case of the 2015 MacBook, Mophie promises an added 14 hours of life.

That ability comes thanks to the wonders of USB-C. It used to be a lot trickier to make external batteries for MacBooks — take the sad tale of HyperMac, which had to cease production when Apple threatened the company over charging port patents. USB-C also means two-way power, so the battery can be refilled through the same port it uses to charge devices. The Powerstation still has two ports, however (one USB-C and one full USB), so you can charge your laptop and phone at the same time.
Even with all of that functionality, the Powerstation USB-C XXL is pretty pricey. You can already find higher capacity power banks from companies like Anker for less. With Mophie, you’re paying for, among other things, design. The cloth covering makes this one of the nicer power banks on the market, for whatever that’s worth.

While it’s big compared to smartphone-centric power banks, it’s impressive how much charging capacity companies are able to fit in the form factor these days. We’ve come a long way since those early Hypermac days. It’s probably a bit large and expensive for every day use, but the Powerstation will power your MacBook through just about any international flight,  if you find yourself without an outlet. 
I would have killed for one of these things back in my early live blogging days, when my laptop battery couldn’t be counted to make it all the way through a keynote on a charge. Even now, the thing is looking mighty tempting with the long days of CES coverage looming just over the horizon.

The Powerstation USB-C XXL isn’t the ideal gift for everyone, but it should make the frequent traveller or tech blogger on your list pretty happy.

4,Watts is a huge battery that powers your home,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/16/watts-is-a-huge-battery-that-powers-your-home/,2017/05/16,"Like Tesla’s Powerwall, Watts is a big battery that can power your home. One Watts cell can support a few small appliances including computers and refrigerators and a few units can power TVs and electric washers. The units can charge via the grid or with solar panels and the Watts units include an app that shows discharge and battery remaining.
The batteries, which were designed in Russia, are stackable which means you can add as many or as few devices to your power network. They can also send energy back onto the grid as necessary. It offers 1.5 kW with a 3kW peak and a capacity of 1.2 kWh.
The company is shipping batteries in August and one unit costs $2,999. They aim to be the LEGO of high-end home batteries, allowing you to add some real power storage to your home, office, or Zombie-proof bunker.

5,Zero Motorcycles CTO Abe Askenazi on the future of two-wheeled EVs,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/23/zero-motorcycles-cto-abe-askenazi-on-the-future-of-two-wheeled-evs/,2017/03/23,"
Electric cars and buses have already begun to take over the world, as evidenced by daily sightings of EV brands like Tesla, Prius, Bolt and Proterra on U.S. roads. But two-wheeled EVs are still a rare sight. The motorcycle industry has been much slower to put out all-electric and hybrid models relative to peers in automotive.
Big brands like Harley, Honda and Ducati don’t have EV motorcycles on the market today, though customers have indicated interest when they’ve teased electric concepts. And a few startups have failed to make electric bikes that could give combustion engine models a run for their money.
Mission Motors went bankrupt. Brammo put its Empulse EV motorcycles out there to some fanfare, but the small Oregon-based startup sold its bike business to Polaris. The parent company of Victory Motorcycles, Polaris eventually killed off the Empulse. And Brammo now sells power systems to other vehicle and equipment makers.
Survivors and newcomers are still churning out EV motorcycles, though. They include Zero Motorcycles, Lightning Motorcycle and Alta Motors in the U.S., Energica Motor in Italy and China’s Evoke Motorcycles. All are helping to awaken market demand. According to forecasts from ID Tech Ex, the market for smaller electric vehicles, including motorcycles, will comprise about 5 percent of overall EV sales, generating some $35 billion annually by 2027.
Zero Motorcycles CTO Abe Askenazi.
TechCrunch recently caught up with Zero Motorcycles CTO Abe Askenazi, who has been in the motorcycle industry for about two decades, to get his take on what could make electric motorcycles the first choice for riders.
Askenazi said right now, a lot of Zero Motorcycles’ customers buy the company’s EV bikes alongside market-leading V-twins and V-4s. To him, that indicates Zero’s bikes perform at the same or better levels as riders’ long-held favorites.
Besides that, he said, electric bikes are quiet, so riders can hear what’s happening around them, and won’t disturb the peace, which their neighbors appreciate. That quietude is one reason police departments buy Zero Motorcycles for their fleets. They can ride at any hour, and approach suspects stealthily if they drive electric.
Of course, electricity costs less than gas most of the world over. That’s appealing to a certain set of riders — so is the ability to power your bike with solar or wind-generated electricity for those most eco-minded motorcycle enthusiasts.
Zero Motorcycles’ dual-sport electric, the Zero DS.
Zero’s today makes everything from lightweight “hot rods” to sporty off-road models that cost from $8,495 to $15,995. Appreciated for their acceleration, speed, control and easy-to-read instruments, in the past the bikes drew complaints around range. The company has worked hard to improve its battery tech, however, and some bikes in Zero’s 2017 lineup promise 200 miles per charge. That compares to e-motorcycles with a 40-mile range made by Zero just a few years ago.
“Optimization of chemistry has gotten us here. The beautiful thing is that batteries are plug-and-play. When that battery comes that will give you 1,000 miles, we’ll be able to use it,” the CTO said. “Where the industry is going though is not so much a bigger battery to go further between charges, but faster charging so you can go grocery shopping, plug it in, come back and then you’re ready to go again.”
Over time, batteries will take up less weight and space on e-motorcycles, beyond what we can even envision today, the CTO said. That will leave room for cargo and other components, potentially. Already, Zero Motorcycles S and DS bikes give riders a large storage space behind the batteries. “You gain a lot of practicality with this bike,” Askenazi said. Lighter-weight and stronger materials will also transform design, he predicts.

6,Faulty batteries caused a small fire at a Samsung plant in China,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/08/samsung-fire/,2017/02/08,"
Samsung has seemingly put its on-going Galaxy Note 7 issues behind it, courtesy of a couple of recalls, an expensive investigation and promises to implement stricter standards. But the company’s battery woes aren’t yet fully behind it, as it was no doubt reminded earlier today when a small fire broke out in a plant located in Tianjin, China.
The company reported that the fire, localized in a waste facility was subsequently extinguished, with no casualties or equipment damage. The company didn’t offer much in the way of explanation beyond that, though Reuters notes that the local fire department announced via social media that the “material that caught fire was lithium batteries inside the production workshops and some half-finished products.”
Plant operator Samsung SDI was notably one of two suppliers of batteries for the Note 7, ultimately taking much of the heat for the phablet’s troubles. It’s also set to become a supplier for the company’s upcoming Galaxy S8 flagship, the first device to benefit from stricter battery oversight.
Earlier this week, Samsung’s home country of South Korea announced plans to increase regulation around lithium-ion batteries in the wake of the Note 7 news.

7,"HP recalls an additional 101,000 batteries over fire concerns",https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/25/hp-recall/,2017/01/25,"
Back in June, HP recalled 41,000 batteries in the US over concerns surrounding overheating, fire and burn hazards. This week, the company’s tacked a pretty massive number onto that tally, adding 101,000 additional batteries (on top of around 4,000 in Mexico and 3,000 in Canada).
The recall, detailed by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission, covers lithium ion units compatible with HP, Compaq, HP ProBook, HP ENVY, Compaq Presario and HP Pavilion systems sold between March 2013 and October of last year through Best Buy, Walmart, Costco, Sam’s Club and HP’s site.
The additional recall was spurred on by a report of an overheating system that melted and caused charring, resulting in around $1,000 in property damages. The CPSC is recommending that consumers stop using the batteries, pull them out of their laptop and contact HP for a replacement.
According to an HP rep who spoke to CNET about the matter, the recall, while large, apparently effects around one-percent of the laptops the company sold during the three-and-a-half year timeframe covered by the CPSC.

8,Next-gen Samsung EV battery gets 300+ miles of range from a 20-minute charge,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/09/next-gen-samsung-ev-battery-gets-300-miles-of-range-from-a-20-minute-charge/,2017/01/09,"
Samsung’s SDI battery subsidiary announced a new battery cell designed for use in electric vehicles that offers improved density to manage a max range of up to 372 miles on a full charge, with a quick charge capacity that will help it regain 310 miles or so of charge on just 20 minutes of charging. Unveiled at the North American International Auto Show for the first time, the new battery tech come with a 10 percent decrease in the number of units and weight required vs. current production battery units made by Samsung SDI.
Mass production isn’t set to begin until 2021, but the tech should arrive in time to supply the first crop of autonomous cars, which are also targeting street dates sometime within that year from a range of manufacturers. EV and self-driving are tied closely to one another, since both are crucial components for operating the kind of on-demand ride-sharing fleets planned by Ford, among others.
A 20-minute charge delivering that kind of range would help considerably with making EVs more practical for more drivers; it’s around the time you’d spend at a rest stop using the restroom and grabbing coffee or a snack, after all. By comparison, Tesla’s superchargers currently manage to provide around 170 miles of range on a half-hour charge, so Samsung’s planned tech could approximately double that.
Tesla’s long-term goal, according to CTO JB Straubel at the time of the Supercharger’s first unveiling, is to get charging times down to between five and 10 minutes, and it has been quietly boosting the maximum theoretical output of the stations themselves (though Tesla vehicle batteries are still limited to 120 kW in terms of how much power input they can accept).
Tesla produces its own batteries in partnership with Panasonic, and just began construction on its latest generation cells at its Gigafactory in Nevada, while Samsung’s new 21700 cylinder cell model is currently being used by “U.S. automobile startups” in their EVs, according to Samsung SDI. One of those startups is Lucid Motors, a new EV company with a lot of Tesla talent on board.

9,URB-E’s newest foldable electric scooter cuts the price to $899,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/07/urb-es-newest-foldable-electric-scooter-cuts-the-price-to-899/,2017/01/07," 



URB-E is a foldable electric scooter that first launched in prototype-form back at CES in January 2014.
Last year we checked out a version that could carry an adult up to 20 miles at a speed of 15 MPH. While we liked the vehicle, we though the $1,499 price point was a bit too prohibitive for it to truly become mainstream.
So now the company is back with a much more affordable version, that is arguably better than the original.
It’s called the URB-E Sport, and has the same foldable form factor as its older siblings. It has a max range of 16 miles, and a top speed of 14 MPH. And it’s only $899. Considering a Boosted Board will run you somewhere between $999 and $1,599, the new URB-E is actually a pretty great deal if you’re in the market for an urban mobility device.
Part of this cost savings will come from a smaller battery – URB-E explained that many customers weren’t using the full 20 miles of range the Pro’s battery provided. But in return for the reduced capacity, URB-E made the battery removable and added 4 traditional USB and a USB Type-C port – meaning you can charge your phone (or laptop) while you ride. And since it’s removable you can actually use the battery as an external charging pack – at full charge it will charge an iPhone 40 times.
Check out the video above to see the URB-E Sport in action.

10,This battery is powered by bacteria,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/23/this-battery-is-powered-by-bacteria/,2016/12/23,"
Researchers at Binghamton University in New York have created a “bacteria-powered battery on a single sheet of paper.” The project is aimed at creating batteries for disposable microelectronics that can run for weeks using a little bacteria-rich liquid.
“The manufacturing technique reduces fabrication time and cost, and the design could revolutionize the use of bio-batteries as a power source in remote, dangerous and resource-limited areas,” write the researchers.
The researchers used a piece of chromatography paper and a ribbon of silver nitrate under a layer of wax. The anode was made of “a conductive polymer on the other half of the paper” and a reservoir held bacteria-rich liquid. The cellular respiration powered the battery.
You’re not going to power your car with these but you will be able to squeeze out a little juice. The batteries expel “31.51 microwatts at 125.53 microamps with six batteries in three parallel series and 44.85 microwatts at 105.89 microamps in a 6×6 configuration.” The researchers believe these batteries can run glucose sensors, detect pathogens, or keep small electronics alive for days without traditional power supplies.
Interestingly this isn’t the first bacteria battery his team has made. The team “developed its first paper prototype in 2015, which was a foldable battery that looked much like a matchbook.” The best part? “Earlier this year they unveiled a design that was inspired by a ninja throwing star.”

11,New lithium metal tech can create ultralight car batteries and thinner phones,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/19/new-lithium-metal-tech-can-create-ultralight-car-batteries-and-thinner-phones/,2016/08/19,"
Soon cars, drones, phones, and almost anything with a battery are about to get a boost from a new MIT spin-out, SolidEnergy Systems. The company promises to double the battery life of basic lithium ion batteries and will also offer smaller batteries with the power of bigger cells.
Why is this technology important? Because it is better than current battery tech and can maintain an energy density of 400 Wh/kg, it’s non-flammable, and it can be manufactured inside existing factories. In short, it’s Li-ion 2.0.
MIT’s Qichao Hu founded the company while at MIT and spun out the technology in beta last year. The full origin story is pretty cool:

￼While working as a postdoc in the group of MIT professor Donald Sadoway, a well-known battery researcher who has developed several molten salt and liquid metal batteries, Hu helped make several key design and material advancements in lithium metal batteries, which became the foundation of SolidEnergy’s technology.
One innovation was using an ultrathin lithium metal foil for the anode, which is about one-fifth the thickness of a traditional lithium metal anode, and several times thinner and lighter than traditional graphite, carbon, or silicon anodes. That shrunk the battery size by half.
But there was still a major setback: The battery only worked at 80 degrees Celsius or higher. “That was a showstopper,” Hu says. “If the battery doesn’t work at room temperature, then the commercial applications are limited.”
So Hu developed a solid and liquid hybrid electrolyte solution. He coated the lithium metal foil with a thin solid electrolyte that doesn’t need to be heated to function. He also created a novel quasi-ionic liquid electrolyte that isn’t flammable, and has additional chemical modifications to the separator and cell design to stop it from negatively reacting with the lithium metal.
The end result was a battery with energy-capacity perks of lithium metal batteries, but with the safety and longevity features of lithium ion batteries that can operate at room temperature. “Combining the solid coating and new high-efficiency ionic liquid materials was the basis for SolidEnergy on the technology side,” Hu says.

The company raised $12 million last year and is going to market in November. They’ll be releasing cell-phone batteries first in 2017 and then move on to car and drone batteries in 2018. They’ve begun manufacturing in Woburn, Massachusetts, in a factory big enough to “house the wings of a Boeing 747.”

People love their smartphones but hate poor battery life. We love having access to the world’s information at our fingertips but tire of the need to constantly plug in to the world’s electricity grid. The recharging model of batteries fails us — the marketplace is ready for a new approach to portable power.
We may be entering the early days of refueling products to gain longer performance and freedom from cords and electric sockets. Beyond powering our devices 10 times longer than batteries, this refueling model of personal power systems might also set the stage for a “leapfrog” energy scenario that brings billions of people into the age of electricity by delivering clean fuels to retail shelves.
Refueling versus recharging
In January of this year, social media spread viral stories about a CES demonstration of an iPhone that could hold its power for a week, and shared images of a hydrogen-fueled drone that could fly six times longer than a battery-operated version. Both stories hinted that there might be a fuel-based revolution ahead in portable energy for our smartphones and laptops.
At the center of the excitement is a magical energy technology: the micro fuel cell. In basic terms, a fuel cell converts chemical energy into electricity. When devices need more power, we simply add more fuel. No wait time for recharging. No cords. Just add clean fuel that you can find on any retail shelf across the world.
The company behind both breakthrough stories is U.K.-based Intelligent Energy. While the British company is far from a household name, industry insiders recognize that Intelligent Energy is within striking distance of a potential game-changer for how we power our portable devices. Carry their vision out far enough and micro fuel cells might also transform how we solve issues of global-energy access to clean fuels and electricity.
While the CES iPhone and drone stories made headlines, an earlier (and more important) announcement was widely ignored. In late 2015, Intelligent Energy entered OEM agreement to develop embedded fuel cells for an emerging smartphone developer. What does this signal mean? Cutting the cord to electrical outlets or charging pads is actually possible with current technology.
As fuel-cell technology matures in the years ahead, we can imagine refueling our phones once or twice a month.
Intelligent Energy isn’t alone in its quest to bring micro fuel cells to the world. First-generation micro fuel cell products — sold as battery rechargers to campers, business travelers and the military — are coming to market from Brunton, MyFC JAQ, Kraftwerk and Ardica. The challenge for these companies is to avoid being branded as a “battery recharging system,” and presenting the technology as a new way of thinking about portable personal power and the role of clean hydrogen-rich fuels.
To jumpstart the transition, all eyes will be on decisions made by manufacturers like Foxconn, Apple, Samsung and Sony, which will deliver the fuel-cell proposition to consumers. These manufacturers want to deliver consumer products that have unprecedented power, performance and convenience. Embedding power plants inside devices would be a small leap for manufacturers, and a potentially giant leap for consumers seeking to escape the cycle of daily recharging.
The future of refueling portable devices is an ideal business model: more convenient for consumers and also more expensive. Skeptics may question consumer willingness to shift from very cheap electricity (annual recharging costs under $10) to buying premium fuels (likely $30-100/year). Opportunists will point to bottled water as an example of where a portable, premium version of a cheaper product has succeeded.
Premium cartridges of hydrogen-rich fuels would be available on retail shelves and everywhere across the public landscape (think malls and airports that currently offer charging stations). Because fuel devices run 6-10 times longer than batteries, the need to refuel will be infrequent. As fuel-cell technology matures in the years ahead, we can imagine refueling our phones once or twice a month. The tremendous benefit lies in the constant uptime and, by extension, a lack of stress that our batteries will die while we’re on the go.
Challenges and opportunities
Will our default fuel be hydrogen or a liquid fuel like butane currently used for lighters? The standards for refueling micro fuel cells remain unresolved. The sector is ripe for a battle of Beta versus VHS (or, more recently, Apple charger plug versus newer Apple charger plug). The most likely candidates are portable fueling packets of hydrogen-rich gas, liquid fuels or solid-state hydrogen.
Portable fuels and micro fuel cells offer something the cleantech world has yet to see: incentive-free, market-driven growth. While solar, wind and behind-the-meter battery storage have relied heavily on government incentives to jumpstart and sustain growth, micro fuel cells don’t require a government subsidy for growth. Selling fuels on retail shelves opens a pathway that is entirely driven by consumer demand as people will pay more for hydrogen-rich fuel because it powers their devices for significantly longer than electricity-dependent batteries.
We might expect first-generation fuel cells embedded in smartphones and laptops within the next five years.
Hydrogen’s role as a universal energy carrier is an upside for this scenario of portable personal power. Suppliers of hydrogen-rich fuels can emerge in any region around the world using feedstocks from traditional natural gas or from new cleantech brands that sell solar-hydrogen or bio-derived hydrogen at a premium. Concerns over energy losses from producing and storing hydrogen are muted these days as researchers improve nano-materials that drive chemical reactions.
Incremental revolution of refueling versus recharging
The next decade will be critical for micro fuel-cell innovations. Think of the technology as somewhere between a late 1980s Motorola carry-pack cellular phone and the late 1990s flip phone. The vision of fuel-based power systems is compelling, and the technology’s maturity hints at an S-curve tipping point ahead. Yet this energy platform will still need old-fashioned time and experience.
Believing in this scenario rests on two assumptions that must remain true. The first is that refueling beats recharging. The electrochemical conversion of fuels into electricity will always outperform the storage approach of batteries. Second, the profits of selling fuels will sustain this higher-cost path of embedded fuel cells while dropping costs for global scaling.
Slow pace of fast change
No roadmap for rethinking portable energy has been made public yet, but by taking a deep look at positioning by industry players and consumer frustration with batteries, we might expect first-generation fuel cells embedded in smartphones and laptops within the next five years. From there, the cost curve matures and the scaling phase begins. Headlines from the not-too-distant future might resemble the following timeline:
August 2018: The energy revolution at… Burning Man. News stories emerge from Burning Man communities embracing small stationary and micro fuel cells to power camps and art pieces. Many in the community applaud the small footprint and efficiency of these solid-state devices and claim that the hydrogen fuel is produced from green sources. Skeptical Burners complain that empty hydrogen fuel packets litter the Playa and express concerns of waste byproducts.
September 2020: Apple CEO Ashton Kutcher announces embedded fuel cell for iPhone 10. The audience commends the elegant design of Apple iFuel dispensers and H2 cartridges — ignoring the fact that Apple will now make an estimated $85 a year per consumer to refuel their devices.  Apple fans rejoice and say the premium is worth the convenience to only refuel devices twice a month.
December 2022: China’s five-year fuel-cell plan. The Communist Party announces revision to its latest Five-Year Plan and will focus on higher-value product integration and scaling challenges of embedded fuel cells inside consumer devices and industrial equipment.
April 2024: Intel acquires Intelligent Energy. In its push for embedded energy systems, Intel acquires the talent and assets of U.K.’s fast-growing fuel-cell designer. The US$6 billion acquisition represents a new direction for Intel into clean energy space.
November 2028: The cordless Christmas. If we thought unplugging from the landline phone was big, retailers are now touting cordless fuel-cell-based products. IKEA has announced plans to eliminate cords by 2035. GE sells an LED lightbulb with all the fuel it will ever need for its lifetime.
May 2029: Texas copper-free construction permits. Texas has become first state to grant permits for residential and commercial housing to be built without internal electrical wires and wall sockets. Micro and stationary fuel cells are expected to eliminate the high costs of wiring buildings, possibly rendering electricians the buggy-whip makers of our era.
October 2030: Amazon + Walmart compete to become the No. 1 fuel distributor. Large retailers see opportunities in delivering a range of fueling solutions, from liquid hydrogen-rich fuels to solid-state hydrogen packets. CEOs from Amazon and Walmart have announced their vision to become the world’s largest fuel distributors. Utility stocks continue to decline.
Illuminating the road ahead
Looking beyond 2030, it’s possible to imagine manufacturers integrating fuel cells inside our coffee makers, lamps, irons, vacuum cleaners, washer-dryers or any other object that benefits from long energy life and cordless convenience. Product designers will be thrilled to say goodbye to cords and dependency on electrical outlets. Simply add a cartridge of new fuel or refuel via a dispenser and you’re up and running.
Beyond predictions of early adopters paying a premium for device fuels is a much more impactful goal: a distribution model for radically expanding global access to electricity. Clean fuels could be brought to market anywhere in the world at a variety of price points. Local markets could generate their own hydrogen-rich fuels from regionally available resources. It’s also not difficult to imagine a low-cost supply chain that enables the manufacturing of solid-state fuel cells in regions across the world.
The expanse is wide between embedding fuel cells in a smartphone and a scalable retail-based global energy marketplace. To fill in the gaps, companies like Intelligent Energy will need to solve deep technical challenges and follow sustainable business models that focus on early-adopter markets. For now, micro fuel cells give us a compelling vision for moving beyond batteries and possibly transforming how billions of people might leapfrog into the age of electricity.

Battery life remains the fly in the ointment of consumer smartphone satisfaction. Not to mention all the other devices we’re being encouraged to strap on our person or stick in our bags as computing shifts from fixed locations to something that’s near ubiquitous and (increasingly) personal. So it follows that companies which can even incrementally improve battery performance are likely to find their tech in demand.
To wit: Qnovo, a Newark, California-based firm that’s been developing battery charging enhancement technology since 2010 — and is today announcing an $8.6 million Series B funding round, with Intel Capital joining as a strategic investor, alongside existing investors RockPort Capital, US Venture Partners and Blue Run Ventures.
Its adaptive charging tech — which apparently speeds charging times without shortening battery lifespan — has not yet been commercially deployed but it says the new financing will be used to support the launch of “multiple smartphones” using its tech next year. It’s also planning to expand application to other devices, such as laptops and wearables, although smartphones remain its initial focus.
How does its battery enhancing technology work? It’s a layer of software that analyzes how a lithium-ion battery is charging and adapts current and voltage in real-time to optimize the process. (Which sounds much like the approach of TC Disrupt NYC 2015 alum, Nucleus Scientific, which launched on stage at our startup battlefield competition back in May.)
“Current charging of batteries in place for a century is a one way process (CCCV) that is blind to the chemical reactions inside the battery that cause degradation. Through the controlled introduction of charge and subsequent measurement of response, Qnovo is able to “see” degradation mechanism signatures and adjust charging current and voltage in real-time to minimize cell damage while simultaneously minimizing charge time,” says Qnovo Nadim Maluf, co-founder and CEO.
“From extensive measurement over four years, we see from two to eight times longer cycle life as compared to CCCV. With longer cycle life, the battery can be charged faster and still last for two years.”
Maluf claims there are multiple advantages to using its adaptive battery charging tech. “The best smartphones today only offer two of the four key battery performance attributes: capacity (use time), fast charging, battery lifetime, and thin and light. Apple iPhone 6 is thin and light with good lifetime but sacrifices capacity and charges slowly. Samsung Galaxy S6 is thin and light but reduced capacity from the S5 in order to offer fast charging. With Qnovo technology, smartphone OEMs can offer excellent use time (3Ah+ capacity), fast charging (1 day use with 20 minute fast charge), two year lifetime (800 cycles) in a thin form factor (7mm or less thickness) — simultaneously,” he tells TechCrunch.
“The technology is broadly applicable to applications where longer cycle life or faster charging is beneficial. It works with standard lithium-ion batteries and requires no changes, so it can be quickly deployed to production with no added cost to battery manufacturing. As software, it uses available compute resources and does not add additional hardware cost. The benefits vs standard charging increase with faster charging and higher energy density cells,” he adds.
All of which sounds rather too good to be true, which is probably why Maluf is so pleased to snag Intel as an investor. “We are very pleased with the addition of Intel as a strategic investor. We see this as a validation of our technology as well as the importance of improving battery performance in mobile devices,” he notes.
If Qnovo can get its lithium-ion improvement tech to market next year it’s likely to beat off more ambitious approaches to boosting battery performance — such as Israeli startup StoreDot which has raised some $76 million in funding since 2012, and has been demoing prototypes of a faster charging battery since last year (but has yet to bring them to market in phones).
StoreDot faces an arguably bigger challenge in getting its battery boosting tech to market given the batteries themselves involve new technology (it’s using bio-organic nano-crystals, rather than existing lithium-ion cells). Last October the company was suggesting 2017 for a commercial deployment of its tech. It’s since expanded its focus to building very fast charging batteries for electric cars, so it’s arguably now less focused on the smartphone segment.
Others playing in the battery enhancement space include Sakti3, which is developing a solid state battery tech that’s purportedly higher density than lithium-ion cells; and Seeo, which is working to shrink cell size without compromising capacity via lithium-polymer batteries. Stanford scientists have also been probing the potential of aluminum-ion for boosting battery performance.
There’s certainly no shortage of ambition to improve battery performance. Who can actually deliver those much-needed enhancements remains to be seen — leaving consumers to lug around a spare battery pack in the meanwhile.

Scientists at Stanford University have developed a prototype bendable battery made from aluminum that charges very quickly, is long lasting and offers safety advantages over lithium cells given the materials used are less volatile and do not catch fire if perforated. So, bottom line, aluminum-ion batteries could result in safer consumer electronics in future that also charge faster and can have thinner or even flexible form factors — all of which sounds pretty handy for future generations of wearables.
We’ve seen thin and bendy lithium-ion batteries in research labs before, but aluminum offers cost and safety advantages over lithium — hence researchers’ ongoing interest in the material. And while developing a high performance, commercially viable aluminum-ion battery has proved elusive thus far, the Stanford researchers stumbled on using graphite (a type of carbon) for the cell’s cathode — which they say yields good performance.
Their battery has been able to withstand more than 7,500 charging cycles without any loss of capacity, vs other lab developed aluminum batteries typically lasting around 100 cycles before expiring. “This was the first time an ultra-fast aluminum-ion battery was constructed with stability over thousands of cycles,” the authors write in the journal Nature, where their research has been published.
The ionic liquid electrolyte they’re using for the battery is a salt that’s liquid at room temperature — another safety and environmental advantage for their proto cell — held inside a flexible polymer-coated pouch. Their battery can generate around 2 volts of electricity, which they say is also higher than other researchers have achieved with aluminum. In the video they demo a couple of their prototype batteries being used to charge a smartphone “within a minute”.
Of course it’s early days for the research, with improvements to voltage and energy density required if the tech is to be commercialized. But the researchers seem positive their aluminum-ion battery tech has promise.
“Our battery produces about half the voltage of a typical lithium battery. But improving the cathode material could eventually increase the voltage and energy density. Otherwise, our battery has everything else you’d dream that a battery should have: inexpensive electrodes, good safety, high-speed charging, flexibility and long cycle life. I see this as a new battery in its early days. It’s quite exciting,” Hongjie Dai, a professor of chemistry at Stanford and one of the researchers, told the Stanford Report.
Beyond small electronics devices, one interesting potential use-case mentioned by Dai is for storing renewable energy on the electrical grid. Lithium cells’ durability means they aren’t ideally suited for this application. But aluminum cell’s ability to last for tens of thousands of charges, and their rapid charge and discharge, offers a possible future alternative.

15,The FiiV Case Straps A Hotspot And Battery To Your iPad,https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/15/the-fiiv-case-straps-a-hotspot-and-battery-to-your-ipad/,2014/12/15,"
If you pick up a Wi-Fi iPad only to then find out you need wireless on the go all the time, your options for getting it access aren’t ideal. You either activate the hotspot feature on your phone, wasting battery life, or you get an external hotspot that you have to carry around with your other devices.
The FiiV case, with its built-in hotspot and battery, helps improve both solutions. For those who prefer to just flick a switch in settings on their phone to have LTE, you can keep your iPhone topped up by plugging your Lightning cable into the battery’s USB port.
If you’d prefer a dedicated device for Wi-Fi, the case accepts SIM cards for most GSM carriers, including AT&T, T-Mobile, and European networks for international travelers. FiiV is available for both iPads Air and Mini, with both case sizes offering the same battery and hotspot.
If you get the FiiV from the case’s Indiegogo page, it’s currently still available at $99. That’s a pretty big discount from the eventual $179 retail price, and you’ll be among the first to get one in May. As for the rest of the pricing tiers, I have to say that they’re pretty disappointing. Instead of offering pricing tiers that go up by say, $20 each batch, they let you buy in bundles of up to 10. Who would buy that many units of a first-generation device?

16,"Apple Watch Will Need Juicing Daily, Says Tim Cook",https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/28/apple-watch-winding/,2014/10/28,"
Apple fans hoping Cupertino’s reality distortion field was going to do magical things to the battery life of its forthcoming Apple Watch had better reset their expectations to something far more average: the wrist computer will likely need charging daily according to Apple CEO Tim Cook. So, in other words, much like other high end smartwatch wearables already on the market.
And indeed, much like the mechanical watches of yesteryear which needed winding daily.
“We think people are going to use it so much you will end up charging it daily,” said Cook, speaking in an on stage interview at the WSJ:D live conference — and attempting to put a positive spin on the disappointment of another daily recharging routine.
So, on the plus side, if you end up not using your expensive Apple Watch very much at all you might not need to recharge it every day. Er, great!
Battery life continues to be a serious bugbear for wearables. And indeed an ongoing pain-point for smartphones — although one that typically passes without much comment from Apple.
Instead the company routinely shaves a few millimeters off its handsets every year, thereby squeezing the amount of on board battery real estate in the interests of being able to announce an ‘even sleeker’ iPhone. (When most users would probably cry tears of a joy for an iPhone with a fatter battery.)
While smartphone users are largely resigned to the daily charging grind (and/or keeping a spare battery pack close by) it’s a pretty big ask for a secondary device to also need juicing daily. Especially one that’s worn on the wrist.
The Apple Watch competes for wrist space with far less smart watches that nonetheless have far superior battery lives — being good for years of use. Or indeed having automatic mechanisms that are powered by the movement of the human body so never need recharging. For all its smarts, a smartwatch that prematurely runs out of juice and reverts to a blank slab of glass is going to feel pretty dumb in comparison.
The Apple Watch has a magnetic induction charging mechanism — using a magnetic connector that attaches to the back of the device. Whether that familiar magnetic tug will help lessen the friction of daily charging an expensive wrist-worn wearable remains to be seen.

I like backup batteries – I carry more than a few, and they all get used eventually, especially when I travel. But sometimes I worry: What will happen to my portable backup power in case of the The End of Days? Should the world be buried in a never-ending blizzard, or should a meteor impact block out the sun and bury everything in a three-foot layer of ash, will my juice reserves still be operational?
With the Limefuel IP66 Rugged external battery, the answer is yes. The gadget is being crowdfunded on Kickstarter right now (and has already blown past its $30,000 goal in just a few days), offering up a maximum of 15,000 mAh in reserve power, depending on the configuration you choose. Other backup chargers out there offer up that much spare energy (including a number of low-cost options on Amazon), but none offer it in a case that’s quite so rugged.
The L150XR is waterproof, dirtproof, and crush or shock proof (not just ‘resistant,’ you’ll note), and is IP66-certified. For those who aren’t familiar with the ratings system for rugged devices, IP66 means that the pack is completely sealed against dust, and that it can withstand “powerful water jets” from any direction, for up to three minutes, in addition to submersion. You’ll have to have all the flaps closed to ensure that level of protection, of course, but that’s still very impressive.

Other features of the L150XR include that massive capacity, which is good for probably around 10 charges of your smartphone, as well as two charging ports that work simultaneously, and 2A input for faster charging of the backup battery itself (though it’ll still take between 9 and 15 hours to fill it up). It even has pass-through charging (meaning you can charge it and an attached device simultaneously), which is something people missed in the Mophie Powerstation XL I recently reviewed.
Boulder-based Limefuel was founded in November 2012 and already makes charging gadgets for mobile devices, so it stands a good chance of making its projected May 2014 ship date. Pre-orders start at $50 for a lower capacity, 10,400 mAh version, but the big 15,000 mAh edition starts at $70 (still cheaper than many top-end competitors, however).
You may not need the intense environmental resistance the L150XR provides, but on the other hand, there’s no good reason not to have it, either. And if you do back this, know that the end of time, when your phone is long gone and everyone you know has succumbed to high levels of particulate matter in the air, you’ll still have power left in the bank.

18,Mophie’s Powerstation XL Packs In The Power For Extended Time Away From Outlets,https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/29/mophie-powerstation-xl-review/,2013/12/29,"
Our devices have a never-ending hunger for power – it’s their single greatest failing, in a time when they can do incredible things but still only last around a day of solid use in the best-case scenario. But Mophie has made a name for itself providing extra juice for your devices, and now they’ve got a new Powerstation XL model that packs a crazy 12,000 mAh, which can charge some smartphones up to eight times over.
Pros:

Battery lasts and lasts
Intelligent amperage for less power wastage
Two ports for charging

Cons:

Price
A bit on the bulky side

Mophie’s Powerstation XL isn’t reinventing the wheel, it’s just making the wheel a lot bigger. Even design-wise, it resembles previous Mophie power pack devices, with a rubberized black top and bottom ‘sandwiching’ a silver wraparound rim. A button on the side will light up an LED indicator to tell you how much juice is remaining (to the nearest quarter), and two USB 2.0 ports on the top can charge up to two devices simultaneously, while a micro USB input is used to fill it back up once it’s empty.
The sandwich look is simple, good and a nice fit with Apple products, with which I’m generally using the Mophie Powerstation XL. Plus, the whole thing feels terrifically well-built, and you can imagine that if you pop the lid, it’ll be tightly packed edge to edge with battery cell units. Mophie’s backup batteries feel like they can survive a fall, which is more than you can say for a lot of the lower-priced models it competes with.
And the Mophie Powerstation XL also works as advertised. I used the partial charge it came with to fully reenergize a Nexus 5, HTC One and Nvidia Shield before it exhausted itself, and subsequent charges have managed to serve up multiple charges to my iPhone 5 while also topping up an iPad Air on the run. Plus, in terms of charge retention, you can easily have the XL in a bag for days without it losing a single dot of its energy meter to dissipation.
Mophie does good retention, and good overall life of the bank itself, which is why they can get away with asking for $130 for a backup battery and someone like IOgear charges a lot less. The XL is brand new, so I haven’t had the opportunity to test its longevity yet, but the Powerstation Pro I’ve had now for a couple of years still seems not to be noticeably diminished vs. when I first bought it.
The bottom line is that if you need serious backup juice in a relatively small package that’s bound to be reliable, Mophie’s latest delivers. It’d be great if someone made a smartphone that eliminated the need for such a thing, but until then, at least there’s the Powerstation XL.

19,Apple Replacing ‘Limited’ Number Of iPhone 5s With Manufacturing Issue Leading To Battery Life Problem,https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/29/apple-limited-number-of-iphone-5s-have-manufacturing-flaw-leading-to-low-battery-life/,2013/10/29,"
Apple released a statement today to The New York Times noting that a manufacturing issue has caused shortened battery life in a ‘very limited’ number of iPhone 5s devices. At its introduction, the phone was reported by Apple to have nearly identical life to the iPhone 5, and most tests have borne that out with reviewers seeing identical or slightly improved numbers.
The statement, issued by an Apple spokesperson, indicates that a small number of the iPhones that Apple has sold so far are defective. Here’s the statement given to the Times:
“We recently discovered a manufacturing issue affecting a very limited number of iPhone 5S devices that could cause the battery to take longer to charge or result in reduced battery life,” said Teresa Brewer, an Apple spokeswoman. “We are reaching out to customers with affected phones and will provide them with a replacement phone.”
The Times says that Apple’s statement ‘implies’ that this is only a few thousand devices, but Apple themselves gave no exact number. Apple sold 9 million iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c and iPhone 4s devices in its launch weekend in September.
iPhones do not have user replaceable batteries, making the life of those batteries of paramount importance. In general, iPhones get comparable battery life to other devices in the same size and thickness. Other devices from Motorola, Samsung and more have made design decisions that allow them to get greater battery life by packing in larger or thicker battery packs.
If that reputation for decent, if not exhilarating, battery life is going to be maintained, Apple will want to make sure that they clamp down on this issue quick. Of course, the bad news about iPhone 5s battery life issues arrives ahead of iPad Air reviews, which are expected later today. Slick.
We’ve reached out to Apple to see if it has any more information to share.

20,Apple Working On Location-Aware Battery Management For iPhone,https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/25/apple-working-on-location-aware-battery-management-for-iphone/,2013/07/25,"
Apple has been tinkering with ways to make the iPhone better at managing battery life intelligently based on usage pattern, a new patent filing published by the USPTO today (spotted by AppleInsider) reveals. The application describes a system that learns your habits, evaluates how much power is needed between your usual charges and does everything it can to keep the phone running when you’re away from power sources.
The invention involves using location data combined with the kind of activity that a user is actually engaging in with their smartphone to give a more complete picture of when they need to be stingy with power and when they don’t. It’s a little like how your Mac can detect when it gets plugged in and then change its power profile accordingly, adjusting things like display brightness and time until sleep. The mobile version would be smarter, however, and even estimate the amount of time a user will be away from a power source and modify energy usage accordingly.
Thus when a person is at home, the phone will know that and not worry too much about longevity. But when a user is traveling long distances, the phone would adjust “characteristics” to compensate. Those power saving strategies could include limiting data fetch intervals, turning down display brightness, turning off open applications or even preventing some from running.
The automatic component of the system would involve the iPhone storing a number of regularly used charging points and estimating time between those points based on daily habits, but users could also directly input specific information, like how long they thing they’ll be away from power for instance. Users could also select from different types of power profiles, the application suggests.
In another neat trick, the system would detect what kind of source is being used to charge and adjust the charging rate accordingly – charging faster when it knows it’s in a car and only available to power for a limited time, for instance, but slowing down at home to decrease the effect on battery health.
Power management is one way to tackle the needs of battery-hungry users who often find that to be the limiting factor of their smartphone devices. In place of sophisticated new battery technologies, this could be what Apple turns to to make iPhones balance ever-increasing processing power and energy demands, and it is a logical development for mobile computing in general.

21,"Tesla Shows Off A 90-Second Battery Swap System, Wants It At Supercharging Stations By Year’s End",https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/20/tesla-shows-off-a-90-second-battery-swap-system-wants-it-at-supercharging-stations-by-years-end/,2013/06/20,"
Tesla teased electric motorheads earlier this week by announcing an event that would show off its curious battery-swapping system, and it wound up being even more impressive than most of us imagined. Long story short, Tesla can swap a Model S’s battery in just 90 seconds (that’s less time than it takes to fuel up a regular car), and you won’t even have to get out of your seat to do it.
“We designed Model S from the beginning to be capable of swapping out the battery pack faster than you can fill a gas tank,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk said at the company’s Hawthorne design studio earlier this evening.
It’s not exactly a secret that the Model S’s battery pack can be switched out as needed, but the company saw fit to keep the details under wraps until today. For the process to run that quickly, you’d expect some technical wizardry to come into play and Tesla certainly delivers. Once a Model S owner parks the car on a designated spot, a platform raises from the ground to disconnect and grab hold of the depleted battery. The platform then descends back into the ground, dumps the battery, retrieves a fresh one, and rises once more to connect it to the car.
Really, it’s one of those things you need to see:

Frenzied drivers will still have to do some work, though — they’ll have to drop off the battery on the return leg of their journey and pay an unspecified “transport fee,” though they can also choose to keep the battery and pony up the difference between the price of the old and new batteries. The first swap-capable locations will be at supercharger stations located along California’s I-5, though the company plans to bring them online at east coast superchargers in short order.
Judging from the videos pouring out of the event, the overall tone of the presentation was exuberant, and it’s hard not to see why: The company is looking at hot-swappable batteries for its electric vehicles as a way to put them on even footing with traditional gas-powered cars. Of course, that’s not to say that bringing those changeable batteries to the masses is going to be easy.
Tesla has spent more than a year constructing supercharger stations along the east and west coasts in a bid to give their electric cars the juice to complete your average languorous summer road trip. Outfitting each of those stations with the ability to quickly replace batteries and get motorists back on the road presents quite a logistics problem. There’s the cost to consider — Tesla expects each battery swap station to cost about $500,000 to build, to say nothing of the maintenance and infrastructure costs that will come now that someone presumably has to stop by each station and replace worn-down batteries. Still, Tesla already has plans to triple the size of its supercharger network. If every one of them is slated to get battery-swapping stations, the prospect of trying to cruise the country in an electric car just got a lot less sketchy.
UPDATE: Tesla has posted an official version of the video with a bigger focus on how darned fast the process is. Check it out.

22,"Gcorelab Gets $482,000 For New Battery Cooling Technology",https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/23/gcorelab-gets-482000-for-new-battery-cooling-technology/,2013/04/23,"
A Singapore clean-tech company called Gcorelab has just received $482,000 (S$589,000) in funding for a new technology that promises to control the thermal issues that have plagued lithium-ion batteries.
Battery packs that use lithium-ion cells such as those found in laptops and, in larger deployments like electric cars, can suffer from cells failing. When the cells do and overheat, they can cause a chain reaction with neighboring cells, in a process known as thermal runway propagation, and this can lead to explosions.
Gcorelab has patented its cooling technology. It relies on cooling plates, and the team claims that its “oblique fin technology” can achieve 50 to 80 percent better results compared with liquid cooling, while using the same amount of energy.
Battery temperatures are managed by transferring heat away from components, and sensors help to regulate the cooling process, said Gcorelab co-founder, Ray Kung. It also works in cold climates, with heaters and coolers jumping in to keep things optimal, he added. (Batteries are finicky things; arctic temperatures can make them blow up, too.)

“Currently, battery thermal management is transitioning from air cooling to liquid cooling systems. While affordable and easy to implement, air cooling is vastly inferior in terms of heat transfer performance compared to liquid cooling,” said Kung.
So while the industry transitions to liquid cooling methods, Gcorelab is hoping its technology will provide a more affordable alternative to the latter.
If successful, the company’s technology could spell revolution for the battery industry and reliant industries, because of the cooling needed to prevent overheating and explosions.
Plenty of lithium-ion batteries have exploded over the years, from iPhones to electric toothbrushes. Bad enough to have something burst into flames while you’re brushing your teeth, but you can see why the airline and automotive industries are a lot antsier about safety standards regarding this.
Boeing’s brand new Dreamliner 787 planes recently suffered battery overheating faults, and regulators ordered all 50 planes to be grounded—the first US fleet grounding to happen in 34 years.
The grounding has reportedly cost Boeing an estimated $600 million, excluding other costs like compensation to airlines which have had business disrupted.
Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, has commented on Boeing’s battery woes. Musk’s diagnosis of Boeing’s design fault is that the 787 batteries have large cells placed close to each other. In order to minimize the cascading effects of thermal runway, Tesla cars use smaller battery cells with gaps between them, and tries to use better thermal insulation inbetween, he has said.
Gcorelab is working with a bus manufacturer in China, which it expects will be the biggest electric vehicle market globally in future. China has set a target to reach 5 million electric vehicles by 2020, to reduce its reliance on oil.
Gcorelab estimates this electric vehicle electronics cooling market to reach $5.7 billion a year by 2020. It also highlighted secondary markets that can be addressed such as cooling for wind turbines and aerospace uses, to be worth about $20 million in the same year.
The startup was founded in early 2011 by Lee Poh Seng and Kung. Lee has a PhD in mechanical engineering, and Kung has an MBA and functions as Gcorelab’s business development guy.
This round of seed funding came from Red Dot Ventures, one of the Singapore government’s appointed early-stage incubators.

23,"Mophie’s iPhone 5 Battery Case, The Juice Pack Helium, Now Available For $79.95",https://techcrunch.com/2013/02/05/mophies-iphone-5-battery-case-the-juice-pack-helium-now-available-for-79-95/,2013/02/05,"
Mophie is one of the most trusted names in iPhone and mobile backup batteries, and the company has finally debuted its battery case for iPhone 5. The Mophie Juice Pack Helium is around 13 percent thinner than the Air version released for iPhone 4S and iPhone 4 (get it? Helium is lighter than air), and retails for $79.95 right now direct from the Mophie store. The cases should ship in time for Valentine’s Day, the company says.
The new Mophie boasts a 1500 mAh battery, which keen readers will notice is technically enough to double the 1,440 mAh power station inside the iPhone 5. That’s enough to boost your device’s talk time life by up to 6 hours on 3G, or provide another 6 hours of cellular browsing, 7 hours of WiFi browsing, 30 hours of audio playback or 7 hours of movie watching, according to Mophie.
The new slim down design is offered in both dark metallic and metallic silver colors, with the dark scheme shipping first, and it has the same LED power indicator and forward-facing speaker ports that have made the Mophie line a winner for the past few years. Of course the things can also stand to shed some weight and girth, so this new thinner design is very welcome, but the fact is that when you need juice and you’re without any kind of outlet, having one of these on hand can really save the day, and they take up less space than something like an external charger.
One final advantage of the Juice Pack Helium is that it has a micro USB port to take the place of the Lightning connector, which handles pass-through charging and data syncing just fine. That’s good news if you’ve already got a ton of micro USB cables (one is also included) lying around from other devices and don’t want to invest heavily in replacing all those 3o-pin Apple chargers from your past iOS devices. This may be one of those cases where a blogger’s needs may not reflect the larger community’s, but I’m definitely a believer given Mophie’s track record, and for sure picking one of these up.

24,Android Phones And Tablets Ranked By Battery Life: Longest Lasting Smartphones Aren’t Top-Tier Devices,https://techcrunch.com/2012/12/18/android-phones-and-tablets-ranked-by-battery-life-longest-lasting-smartphones-arent-top-tier-devices/,2012/12/18,"
Android smartphones can have a pretty bad reputation when it comes to battery life, though that reputation has definitely improved in general over time. A new report updated today from the Root Uninstaller Team (who created Battery Stats Plus for Google’s mobile OS) ranks the top 15 and worst 15 Android devices based on statistics shared through their app. There’s a huge variance between the best and the worst, and the ones on top might not be the flagship devices you’re looking for.
As you can see in the list, Root Uninstaller looks at both Android tablets and Android smartphones, which you might expect to skew the results a little bit. But despite a dominating performance from the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, the list of the top 15 performers was a healthy mix of phones and slates. Coming in a close second with over 60 hours of battery life on average was the LG Optimus Pro, a phone released in July with a hardware keyboard and relatively small 240×320 display running Android 2.3.3 with a 3 MP camera. It’s on odd duck, with its QWERTY and VGA video, but it’s cheap, and according to this list, if it’s battery life you’re after most of all, you can do no better than the Optimus Pro.
The Motorola DROID RAZR HD also ranks pretty highly, highest among more up-market devices, with north of 40 hours battery life on average, and the HTC One V doesn’t rank that far behind with 40 hours. The RAZR HD’s battery life is something I can actually personally attest to: it’s a smartphone that keeps going long after I expect it to have faded. Admittedly, I’m not generally using it that much since it isn’t my main device, but there’s no denying it outlasts most of its competition by a wide margin.
 Way down at the other end of the spectrum, you’ll find the Samsung Galaxy Mini (two versions) with just over four hours each, and the Sony Xperia X8 and LG Optimus G. Samsung appears a lot on the list of the bottom 15, but then it also appears a lot on the top list, too. In fact, one thing this list serves to point out is just how much Samsung now dominates the Android device ecosystem.
Overall, Root Uninstaller’s list covers 474 Android devices and spans 5,585 user-submitted battery reports, so it has a decent-sized sampling, plus you see a lot of synchronicity with what reviewers and users have shared anecdotally about device battery life. The average life overall for Android devices is 20.4 hours, by the way, or just under a full day, and the top battery killer apps are generally actually boring system processes, as well as something called “Cowboy.” Battery life isn’t bad overall based on these numbers, but it’s not great either: next generation battery tech, whatever that ends up being, can’t arrive soon enough.

25,"Gift Guide: HyperJuice 2 External Battery For Mac, iPad And Mobile Devices",https://techcrunch.com/2012/11/19/gift-guide-hyperjuice-2-external-battery-for-mac-ipad-and-mobile-devices/,2012/11/19,"
Short Version
Do you like power? It’s very useful for using all those electronic devices we have. But often, those devices have less power than we’d like them to, especially when we’re traveling or fighting for socket space at a coffee shop or conference. The HyperJuice 2 can provide that power, and lots of it, enough to double the life of a new Retina MacBook Pro, and extend considerably longer the life of other, less power-hungry Macs.
Long Version
Features:

Two 10-watt USB ports for high-speed iPad charging (also works with basically any other device)
OLED display for charge/discharge and battery level info
Battery designed to be fully user-replaceable

Info:

100Wh battery (compared to 50Wh on 13-inch MacBook Air, 95Wh on 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro)
Price: $299.95
Available: Now (ships in 2 weeks)
Product page

The HyperJuice 2 is…
… like your standard external power reserves and battery banks, but on steroids because it’s designed to extend the battery life of your Mac laptop a significant, non-trivial amount. And it manages that, boosting my Retina MacBook’s battery life to around double, and providing quick access to plenty of juice for both iPhones and iPads. Since this is the sequel, you get two USB ports instead of one for simultaneous gadget charging.
Buy the HyperJuice 2 for…
… people who always complain about their battery dying, on any device they have. But make sure they’re at least somewhat technically proficient and willing to get their hands dirty: Apple nixed the MagSafe adapter that used to ship with the HyperJuice, so this one requires surgery if you want it to charge (and not just power) your MacBook’s battery. The kit for converting your MagSafe (not MagSafe 2, mind you, those aren’t compatible) adapter to work with HyperJuice 2 costs $49.95, but it does come with some solid wire strippers that are an awesome addition to any gadget lover’s tool kit.
Because…
… if you have ever run out of juice at a crucial moment and had no way to get the power back on, you already know this is the greatest gift you could ever receive. Definitely not for everyone at $300, but power is a wonderful, wonderful thing that you can’t put a price tag on in some lines of work.

26,"iPhone 5 Battery Images Leak: Only Slighter Larger Than iPhone 4S Battery, Despite Expected LTE",https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/10/iphone-5-battery-images-leak-only-slighter-larger-than-iphone-4s-battery-despite-expected-lte/,2012/08/10,"
In the blogosphere’s continuing quest to assemble a virtual iPhone 5 before Apple unveils a real one in September, 9to5Mac has published images of what appears to be the next iPhone’s battery. Juicy stuff!
As expected, the battery is a bit larger than the last iPhone, but not by much. It jumps from 1430mAh in the iPhone 4S (up from 1420mAh in the iPhone 4) to a 1440 mAh battery. With the expected inclusion of LTE, plus Apple’s turn-by-turn mapping (which is a huge battery drain, at least in iOS 6 beta), we must simply hope that Apple’s dual-core SoC will use this relatively limited power source efficiently.
According to the label on the battery pack, it was created in June of this year, which is right in line with Apple’s iPhone 5 timing.
So what else can we expect in Apple’s next-gen iPhone? For one, a larger 4-inch display at a resolution of 1,136 x 640, along with a new two-tone back panel. You’ll also see a much smaller connector dock along the bottom, as Apple is allegedly replacing the worn out 30-pin dock Apple’s used for so long in its iThings with a 19-pin mini dock.
Of course, iOS 6 will ship with the device.

27,Carat: The Brilliant App That Increases Your Battery Life By Showing What Other Apps To Kill,https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/14/carat-battery/,2012/06/14,"
“Kill Pandora – Expected Battery Life Improvement: 1 hour 50 minutes” This is what you’ll learn from Carat, an incredibly useful free new iOS and Android app that’s the first to give you personalized mobile battery life-saving recommendations.
Carat quietly takes measurements from you device, does some math, combines it with other people’s anonymized data, and sends back tips on if you should update your OS, kill or restart apps, and how many more minutes of tablet or phone fiddling you’ll gain.
As battery tech is expected to improve slowly, some say increasing life just 5% a year, and as we get faster processors, more powerful apps, and brighter screens, everyone could use a Carat in their pocket.

The guys that built Carat? They’re not joking around. They’re a team of top-notch M.S. and Ph.D scientists from the UC Berkeley electrical engineering and computer science department’s  Algorithms, Machines, and People Laboratory (AMP Lab). Carat wasn’t built to make money. It’s the consumer product of cutting-edge battery science and a way for the team to collect more anonymous, privacy-respectful data for research that could make all our devices last longer.
Carat’s recommendations break down into killing off bugs and hogs. These usually aren’t “bad” apps Energy bugs are apps that are sapping a lot more power from you than everyone else because they’re probably malfunctioning, so Carat tells you to restart or re-download them. For example, a notes app that uses little power for 95% of users, but it’s accidentally activating your GPS over and over.
Hogs are apps that just naturally use of ton of power or needlessly run in the background, like streaming music apps. Carat reminds you to shut them down, which is especially useful when you get that 20% battery remaining notification half-way through the day and you’d do anything to still be able to get calls and texts rather than have your phone die.
You can click through suggestions on the Actions for instructions on exactly how to fix your problems. You can also check out the My Device tab to see your average battery life, and a score for how it stacks up against other users.
Some things Carat has discovered:

In an initial test with just 100 users, it found 35 apps with energy bugs proving how badly users and developers need Carat’s data.
Carat has since found thousands of instances of these energy bugs on devices in the wild
Skype, Yelp, and Pandora are some of the most popular energy hogs. They’re not necessarily inefficient, they just require more power than most apps and might be the best to temporarily kill off.


Adam Oliner, the project leader for Carat who’s a Stanford CS Ph.D with degrees in math, CS, and EE from MIT, tells me his app is a big leap forward because other battery life recommendation apps make very unscientific, generic suggestions based only on your data, like “shut down all your apps” or “dim your screen”. Gee, thanks Captain Obvious. Others require you to have jailbroken your phone, go through a lengthy installation process, or even suck a lot of energy themselves.

But Carat’s philosophy is “deploy to the crowd, debug in the cloud” so it can empower everyone to easily collaborate for a more satisfying mobile experience. “Carat uses almost no energy, and the longer you use it, the better recommendations you get. The team even shares its bug data with developers of apps that exhibit them, so they can fix them.
With Carat, knowledge really is power. The app is available for download for iOS, and Android, as well as for tinkering on GitHub.

28,iPhone 4S Battery Life Bugs Got You Down? Try This,https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/31/iphone-4s-battery-life-bugs-got-you-down-try-this/,2011/10/31,"
It hits you when you least expect it. It slips away under a mask of dormant inactivity. And it can ruin your entire day. 
It’s your iPhone 4S battery life, and it sucks. 
It’s been 17 days since the iPhone 4S was released — 19 since iOS 5 — and just like the madness that was Antennagate, complaints are churning out left and right. As Erick so clearly pointed out, the iPhone 4S is meant to offer 8 hours of talk time, or “up to 6 hours” of Internet use on 3G. For so many of us — including iPod touch and iPhone-not-4Ses running iOS 5 — that simply isn’t the case. But there may be hope. 
To start, there are a few possible bugs in iOS 5 that may be sucking an inordinate amount of life out of your battery: a calendar bug and a time zone bug (one of which can be summarily blamed on location services, as can most of the other battery life killers in iOS 5/iPhone 4S). 
The calendar bug is still somewhat unclear, but has been reported in Apple forums. Basically, when your calendar app is turned on in the Notifications Center, events are “re-ordering themselves near-constantly,” which sucks the life straight out of the phone. The only fix as of now, unfortunately, seems to be disabling the calendar app within the Notifications center.
The Time Zone bug, however, seems to be solved (although again, by disabling things). Oliver Haslam over at iDownloadBlog noticed, like many of us, that iOS 5 was sucking his iPhone 4 battery dry. He realized that by going into Settings > Location Services > System Services (all the way at the bottom) > Setting Time Zone, and toggling off the location services, his battery life nearly doubled. According to Haslam, iOS 5 probably has a bug that constantly pings the servers to update location, and thus update time zone settings. 
When it comes down to it, iOS 5’s location services are most usually the culprit in cases of random battery life drainage for no apparent reason. It allows your apps and other services to ping for your location way more often than before, but in many cases it’s totally unnecessary (like TapTap Revenge, for example). Just head into Settings > Location Services and browse through the various apps using the phone’s location. The option to turn it off for some apps but not others is there for a reason; use it.
Don’t forget to dip back into System Services (yep, all the way at the bottom), and disable anything you deem unworthy. Diagnostics & Usage should fall into that category, as it merely sends back information to Apple about the way you use your phone and where. And, any one of the services you turn off can always be turned back on. No harm done. 
Email, especially with certain settings, can really wear on your battery since the Mail app can be set to ping mail servers almost constantly. An easy way to help spare some green bar is to really take a look at your account(s) and what you need out of them. If most of your emails tend to be about daily deals or new book releases, do you really need them pushed immediately to your phone? Axe push if you can, and if your accounts don’t support it anyway, play with your update timings and try to find the right balance between being in the loop and being able to use your phone.
Siri uses up a lot of processing power, but I wouldn’t kill her for it. Siri is one of the iPhone 4S’s best features, and other sacrifices can be made to save her.
Then, of course, the basics: turn off Wifi and Bluetooth, turn down screen brightness, and keep the phone out of the sun and/or heat. Oh, and if you have such crappy service that you’re not really able to use your phone much anyway, you might as well just switch it to Airplane mode. It’ll stop the phone from working so hard to connect and maintain that connection, and should last you much longer once you’re in a place you can actually use it.
The truth is there isn’t some quick fix or magical solution to this problem. It’s a question of priorities. Which apps, which notifications, which location services are worth a speedier death for your iPhone? In the end, it’s your decision. At least until Apple rolls out an update to iOS 5 and squashes a few of these issues.

29,New Wifi Tech Could Double Your Phone’s Battery Life,https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/02/wifi-phone-battery-life/,2011/07/02,"
If you ever get the sense that someone on the wifi network you’re using is hogging all the juice, you may be right. Not only does sharing wifi with others downloading large files interfere with your enjoyment of the latest viral video, but it can majorly drain your battery as well.
A new solution from a Duke University computer science graduate student could alleviate your frustrations and potentially double your battery life by allowing your wifi device to “nap” until more bandwidth is available. This means you might have to wait a couple minutes to watch your video, but that could be a productivity boon anyway.
Justin Manwelier‘s SleepWell is a piece of software that helps maximize download efficiency by alerting the wifi device in your phone when a download is finished on a neighboring device. Most wifi devices have to “stay awake” while waiting for their turn to download, draining a good deal of battery in the process.
“The SleepWell-enabled wifi access points can stagger their activity cycles to minimally overlap with others, ultimately resulting in promising energy gains with negligible loss of performance,” Manwelier said in a statement.
The proximity of wireless devices affects their performance as well, with longer download times in more crowded areas, like cities. And, as cloud computing continues to grow, the reasons for connecting to wifi will increase. Putting a wifi-connected device on standby until a download from another device is complete increases both devices’ battery life.
No word yet on when SleepWell will be released, but once it is, we can all look forward to having more time to surf before seeking out an outlet.

30,Concept USB Drive/Battery Is At Least Clever,https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/18/concept-usb-drivebattery-is-at-least-clever/,2011/01/18,"
Designer Wonchul Hwang has an idea: it’s a AA battery with a pop out USB connector that doubles as a flash drive and a rechargeable battery, thus allowing you to power your electronic devices and… ummm… store data on them? At the same time? At different times?
Unfortunately, once you start thinking about this device you kind of realize it’s dumb. What happens if you need the data off the drive? Or need to charge multiple batteries? What happens when you overheat the battery? Do you lose the data? So many questions!
This is basically a concept so let’s all stare at it and move on, shall we? And, to be fair, Wonchul’s Wrap Stove, a heater that wraps around a pot, is considerably cooler.

Apparently, it takes a whole lot of battery life to power a 3D screen, even one the size of the 3DS.
It appears that the 3DS may have a bit of a battery issue. According to the specifications on the Nintendo Japan website, when playing cartridge games you can expect a battery life of 3.5 hours. It’ll also take 3.5 hours to recharge the device. Battery life does improve if you use software instead of cartridges, but it may take some time before there’s software in the store that supports the 3D functionality. So the real question is will the battery life be an issue for you? Or do you still want to buy a 3DS?

We’ve covered quite a few electric bikes over the years, but Panasonic’s new model, the oddly named EX BE-ENE [JP, PDF] has one feature that makes it stand out: at 12Ah, it boasts the battery with biggest capacity for an e-bike out there, according to the company. Panasonic says its version tops conventional e-bike batteries by around 20% in this area.
Like most other electric bikes, the EX BE-ENE has three modes. There is the automatic mode, which lets you travel 46km on a single charge, the power mode (46km) and the eco-mode, which even makes it possible to travel for 66km. The battery takes 4 hours to charge.

I should qualify that, it makes sense for fleet vehicles. Perhaps with a redesign and a giant socket in the trunk for the worlds largest AA battery, but the current technology certainly isn’t set up for a quick change. TreeHugger reported on all the gory details, and the end result is until battery technology matures to the point where we’re able to get better distance out of a cell, this may be what the future holds.

35,Flying Green: The Possibilities And Challenges Of Electric Aircraft,https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/12/flying-green-electric-aircraft/,2010/08/12,"
Airplanes release greenhouse emissions into the atmosphere and require enormous amounts of fuel to fly. A Boeing 747 can consume up to five gallons of fuel per mile. But what if planes could be powered by electricity?  Though they won’t replace passenger airliners anytime soon, small, zero-emission, electric planes are flying today.
Engineers have been pursing electric flight for decades. In 1979, the Solar Riser became the first manned electric aircraft to fly. It used photovoltaic cells to charge a battery that powered an electric motor, but could only fly five minutes, at which point it could either glide or land.
Many enhancements have been made since, and several models of electric planes are showing signs of promise. Two of the most interesting planes to fly recently are the E430 and the SkySpark.
Yuneec International‘s E430 won the Lindbergh Electric Airplane Prize at the World Electric Aircraft Symposium last month. Yuneec opened a 260,000 square foot factory in China and was the first commercially available electric aircraft, with a price tag of $89,000.
The E430 seats two people and flies up to 95 miles per hour, or 60 miles per hour when cruising. Without passengers the plane weighs 561 pounds, which includes its 184-pound lithium polymer battery that needs three to four hours to charge.
This video from Yuneec shows the plane in action:

The SkySpark set a record for electric airplane air speed when it reached 155 miles per hour last year. It also runs on lithium polymer batteries, though its manufacturer, the Italian startup DigiSky, wants to try hydrogen fuel cells next.
Here is a video of its record-setting flight:

Electric planes capture the imaginations and ambitions of many, including Tesla founder Elon Musk, who has said he’s interested in building an “electric super sonic plane” in the future.
NASA is also behind the cause, helping run Centennial Challenges for Aeronautics competitions to encourage aircraft innovation. Next summer’s competition, the Green Flight Challenge, will center around efficiency: the minimum bar for entry will be for aircraft that can surpass the equivalent fuel-efficiency of 200 miles per gallon per passenger.
The technology is improving, but that doesn’t mean it’s near developed enough to green up 747s. One of the main things prohibiting passenger planes from going electric is battery technology. Batteries with enough juice to power a plane are heavy and large, but airplanes need to be light to take off and stay in the air.
Solar powered airplanes have the advantage of being lightweight in comparison to battery-powered planes. Earlier this summer, a solar powered airplane set a new record by flying for 26 straight hours. Its 12,000 solar cells charged batteries that took over when the sun set. This solar/battery combination can theoretically keep a plane in the air for years, though its size and weight capacity is still limited by battery technology.
Wireless power transmission has also been tested, though far less than battery and solar. The technology sends microwave energy or lasers through the air to an airplane’s receiver. NASA has demonstrated the technology works with small, unmanned solar craft, but has yet to try it on larger aircraft.
Another concept that could help longer flights become more feasible is regenerative soaring, in which a propeller acts as a wind turbine to generate energy when the plane flies through an updraft. The Electraflyer C‘s propeller can be turned into a wind-powered generator at a flip of a switch to charge its lithium-ion-polymer batteries. The plane weighs 380 pounds and can fly about 90 minutes, reaching speeds of up to 80 miles per hour. Once drained, the batteries require a six-hour charge.
It’ll be a long time before your next commercial business flight is green, but those considering a pilot’s license have a few greener birds to choose from.

The trade-off between compact size and prolonged battery life has plagued iPhone owners pretty much since the product was released. There’s only so much space to cram battery cells in that sleek form factor, so the operating time of the phone is restricted. A variety of products have entered the market to extend the life of your iPhone battery without overly extending the bulk of the phone. The newest entrant in this market, the MiLi Power Skin, purports to be the slimmest external battery for your iPhone yet.

•	World’s thinnest external battery and protective case for iPhone 3G and 3GS
•	Pass-through USB/mini-USB allows you to charge and sync your iPhone without removing case
•	1,200 mAH battery capacity doubles the life of your iPhone 3G & 3GS
•	8 two-toned color combinations using black, white, blue, green, orange, and silver
•	Apple certified with a one-year manufacturer’s warranty


Not content to make the smallest external iPhone battery, MiLi also has the PocketPal, the “World’s smallest mobile phone USB Charger”.  Presumably it’s also the world’s easiest-to-lose USB charger!
The Power Skin runs $69.95, and the PocketPal is $19.95. Buy ’em both in the Power Skin+ combo for $79.95

We have reported about electric bicycles multiple times in the past, but today Sanyo in Japan announced [press release in English] the “eneloop Hybrid Bicycle” whose battery riders can actively charge while pedaling on flat roads. Previous models, for example this one Sanyo released in 2008, mainly harness energy from braking when the bike goes downhill (“Loop Charge Mode”).
Dubbed Eco Charge Mode, Sanyo will use the new system in their next eneloop models, the CY-SPL226 (26-inch wheel diameter/pictured on top) and CY-SPL224 (24-inch wheel diameter). Riders can still charge the 25.2 V-7.6 Ah battery via the Loop Charge Mode, but now have more options to save energy for longer riding distances with the new system (Sanyo says the Eco Charge Mode increases the assisted travel distance by about 53%).

The two new models feature an assisted travel distance of up to 55km and even 68km when equipped with an extra battery. A full charge of the battery takes 280 minutes.

Sanyo plans to start selling the new e-bikes in Japan on April 28 (price: $1,800 each). The company unfortunately doesn’t say if the eneloop bikes will ever be sold outside Japan (where 350,000 bikes have been sold last year) as well.

Battery-powered socks that help keep your feet warm? What may sound a bit like overkill at first does make sense when you think of motorcycle riders or people having to work outdoors for long hours during winter. Made by Tokyo-based Bionics Japan, the so-called Heat Sock EX [JP] heats your entire foot by incorporating conductive carbon fibers.
The Heat Sock EX warming system mainly consists of a lithium ion battery pack (4,400mA, 7V), cords, a switch to control the temperature in five levels and the socks themselves (you can choose between S- and L-sized socks). Bionics Japan says the socks can be worn by both men and women and that the system is designed so you can wear it to any clothes you like.
The Heat Sock EX will keep your feet warm for three to ten hours on a single charge. It’s Japan-only, but people living anywhere can get it in the Japan Trend Shop (where the whole system costs $265).

Specifically, it stated that they’ve worked out a way to increase battery life by 85%. That means that the new firmware update will allow you to leave your Kindle on (with the wifi active) for about 7 days before you need to recharge. Additionally, the Kindle will now support Adobe’s PDF format natively. Previously, you had to convert PDFs in order to view them on the Kindle.
In addition to the PDF functionality and improved battery life; the firmware update also adds the ability to manually control your screen rotation and makes it possible to convert your PDF files to the Kindle format. To read more about this update or to download it manually go here.

41,"Solar energy and lithium-ion batteries: Sanyo now builds ""green"" homes in Japan",https://techcrunch.com/2009/11/19/solar-energy-and-lithium-ion-batteries-sanyo-now-builds-green-homes-in-japan/,2009/11/19,"
Sanyo is already being considered Japan’s “greenest” brand in the consumer electronics field (which is the main reason Panasonic is about to acquire the company), but them building complete, eco-friendly buildings is certainly new. Sanyo Homes [JP], a wholly-owned subsidiary, will start marketing all-electric homes with lithium ion batteries providing back up power to Japanese customers as early as tomorrow. (Sorry for the tiny picture, which shows a CGI-model of how these houses look like.)
Each house will be equipped with a 3.78kw solar energy system. But buyers will also get 1.57kw Sanyo lithium ion batteries to make sure they’ll have access to eco-friendly energy during the night or during days without enough sunlight. Sanyo Homes says that each of their houses will come with ten LED light fixtures running on direct-current power to minimize energy loss and a solar-powered heat-pump water heater.
The company expects these extras to boost the prices for their homes to some extent, but says buyers will be able to recoup the initial plus in investment over time and will also get financial from the Japanese government. A 132sqm Sanyo home, for example, will sell for $355,000, which is $62,000 more than a comparable conventional one (but only eco-friendly homes will get government subsidies, in this case $30,000).

It used to be that a Maglight was the pinnacle of illumination technology. Not any more.
Now, the LED flashlight is king. Lower energy requirements, higher lumens, less heat; the LED really makes a difference. At first, there were problems with focusing the beam, however nowadays it’s not an issue. Most LED flashlights are quite functional, durable (try dropping an incandescent bulb light from 6 feet up) and if you’ll pardon the pun, the future is quite bright.
Enter the mPower. Designed to be used as an emergency flashlight, it’s main power source is a CR123 (photocell) battery, along with a special reserve battery. The reserve battery (which is technology that the builder mPhase specializes in) has a shelf life of 20 years.
In addition to this special power source, the mPower has a built in USB port for emergency charging your cell phone, as well as any other device. The best part: if the CR123 battery is dead, the backup cell will charge your device for you. We don’t know yet how many lumens or any of the other information that really matters to flashlight geeks like myself, unfortunately.
Expect to be released into the wild in March of 2010, the mPower flashlight will set you back somewhere between $250 and $300. Ouch.

43,Researchers creating a nuclear powered battery,https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/07/researchers-creating-a-nuclear-powered-battery/,2009/10/07,"Man has long been on a quest for a better battery. This has resulted in some less then ideal solutions, such as the potato battery (it was half baked) and the onion battery (too smelly). Finally, researchers at the University of Missouri have developed a smaller, more efficient, and hopefully radiation free nuclear battery.
To be fair, there are already a few nuclear batteries around, but the problem with them is they break down rather quickly. This is due to the obvious problem of radioactivity causing the semiconductor to break down. The current versions of the nuclear batteries are used in satellites and pacemakers.
Where the innovation comes in, is the size and how it’s made. The researchers have stated that their goal is to create a battery that is the size of a penny, using a liquid instead of a solid semiconductor. The long term goal, is to take the technology even farther, and create a nuclear battery that is smaller then the thickness of a human hair. Sounds like a great idea to me.

Japan’s biggest business publication, the Nikkei, is reporting that Panasonic is thinking about using lithium ion batterries used in notebooks to power electric cars. Obviously, the big idea is to bring down the overall costs of these vehicles (and make some money for the company, too).
Panasonic aims at replacing the dozens of lithium ion batteries usually required to power an electric car with thousands of cylindrical batteries originally designed for notebooks, resulting in positive cost effects.
In concrete terms, Panasonic wants to push down costs the power systems for (mid-size) electric cars as a whole from the current average of $33,000 to $11,000. The company isn’t first to try this: Tesla’s Roadster from March 2008 also uses batteries originally designed for home electronics.

Sony, so far not known to be a particularly “green” tech company, has announced plans [JP] to commercialize a total of six different models of batteries that contain no mercury. The company said it’s the first that has found a way to mix absorbent raw material into the cathode, eliminating the need to use mercury in the button batteries.
Mercury is said to be a particularly toxic element for humans and the environment alike. So Sony claiming their new technology, which prevents the button battery from swelling, will help reducing 470kg/340l of mercury yearly is good news.

The picture shows a Japanese pack shot. Labeled “Eco”, all six models will go on sale over here on October 10 (prices: $2 per battery). Sony Japan hasn’t said anything yet regarding sales overseas. The company plans to revamp its entire line-up of alkaline (button) batteries this year to fit the new eco-friendly standard.

Hitachi Maxell says in 55% of all cases, batteries are leaking liquid because of overcharging. The company managed to reduce the amount of undischarged zinc (one of the most critical ingredients) by using a new, self-developed zinc alloy, which is called “Microzinc α”.
Hitachi Maxell claims one side effect of the new zinc alloy is that it extends the battery life by 5% compared to Voltage products released last year. AA and AAA batteries are being offered. Users will get a warranty that the batteries will not leak in 5 years when properly handled.

54,Review: Mophie Juice Pack for the iPhone 3G,https://techcrunch.com/2008/12/09/review-mophie-iphone-3g-juice-pack/,2008/12/09,"
Mophie’s Juice Pack for the iPhone 3G is without a doubt a must-have if you can swallow the high price tag of $100. But I’d gladly pay the extra $100 knowing that I can leave the office or my apartment and gallivant around town without fear of having to find a power outlet by mid-day.Pros
It comes fully charged right out of the box.
Four blue LEDs on the back indicate battery levels.
A single charge, which takes roughly 3.5 hours from dead will sufficiently juice up your iPhone 3G from the dead twice over (almost).
Recharging your iPhone 3G with less than 20 percent juice left takes anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes.
The Juice Pack charges over USB, but still syncs with iTunes.
Cons
It’s a bit bulky and does nothing to really protect your iP3G.
It costs $100.
When you initially put the phone into the Juice Pack it vibrates to let you know that it’s connected. When the Juice Pack’s battery is depleted the iPhone has trouble recognizing that and starts to freak out by signaling that it’s connected and then not and so on. So, if you’re a light sleeper or one that keeps this near your bed it could give you a mild heart attack because I almost had one.
Overall
Despite the price tag, I’m going to have to recommend the Juice Pack because it flat out works and doubles your battery life. While the case itself is a bit large, it’s not so big that you wouldn’t throw it into your bag. But I wouldn’t want to put it in my pants pockets either.
Despite claims that 2.2 improves battery life you’re still not going to make it through an entire day without having to recharge. I sparingly used my iPhone 3G before getting the Juice Pack and now I use it till the cows come home and don’t sweat the fact that it’s almost dead by noon.

56,A trio of iPhone/iPod chargers for your perusal,https://techcrunch.com/2008/12/04/a-trio-of-iphoneipod-chargers-for-your-perusal/,2008/12/04,"
 Quick Version: We take a look at three different iPhone/iPod chargers from Kensington, RichardSolo, and i.Sound, weighing the pros and cons of each.
  

i.Sound 2-in-1 Charger and Backup Battery

MSRP: $49.99 
Capacity: 1000mAh 
Includes: Battery, proprietary zip-style cord, folding AC adapter 

Pros: The i.Sound battery itself is small in size, and the charger and zip cord don’t take up much room either, so this kit would be great for travelling when bag space is limited. Plus, it’s small enough to actually use while it’s attached to your device. In a pinch, you could snap the battery to your iPhone or iPod without skipping a beat.
Cons: Don’t lose the proprietary power connector, or this thing will be all but useless. Plus, the 1000mAh capacity is well shy of a full recharge for the iPhone’s 1400mAh battery, for instance, so you’ll need to keep it diligently charged, too.

RichardSolo 1800

MSRP: $69.95 
Capacity: 1800mAh 
Includes: Battery, mini-USB zip cord, wall charger, car charger with two USB ports, 2G and 3G protective tips (to prevent bending the connector), battery also features laser light and flashlight 

Pros: Though the price tag can be off-putting at first, the RichardSolo 1800 kit features enough nerd-tastic extras to bring things back into line. You get an 1800mAh battery, which is good for a complete iPhone recharge and then some, plus you get a compact mini-USB zip cord, a dual-input USB car charger (which everyone needs anyway, right?), a wall charger, and two protective tips to prevent bending the connector. 
And as if that wasn’t enough, the battery also has a built-in flashlight and laser pointer. Of course it does, why wouldn’t it? This is Richard Thalheimer, the former Shaper Image guy we’re talking about here. Plus, one of the most thoughtful features of these RichardSolo chargers is the double charging thing — plug your iPhone into the battery and then the battery into the wall and they’ll both charge up.
Cons: At almost the size of an iPhone itself, the RichardSolo 1800 isn’t great for actually using while you’re on the phone. That extra capacity comes at a price. You can, however, use the battery on its own as a laser pointer or flashlight.
Also, at almost $70, the 1800 places itself on the higher end of iPhone/iPod batteries. If you don’t need all the included extras, it might not be worth it for you.

Kensington Battery Pack and Charger for iPhone and iPod

MSRP: $69.99 
Capacity: 1800mAh 
Includes: Battery, iPod cable, mini-USB cable, AC adapter 

Pros: This Kensington kit suffers from an identity crisis in a good way. On the one hand, it’s a high-capacity iPhone/iPod charger; but you can also take the battery pack out of the equation and use the AC adapter and iPod cable as a standard wall charger. Plus, since the battery pack uses a standard USB connector, you can charge just about any USB-powered device, not just iPods and iPhones. So it’s a good all around charger for many of your portable devices.
Cons: From a traveler’s perspective, the Kensington charging kit does little to cut down on cords and, as such, takes up more packing space than most devices. Also, it’s definitely not a walk-and-talk solution if you need to juice up on the go but, again, you can use it for your other gadgets beyond just your Apple devices. It’s just a question of whether or not $70 for something like that is worth it to you. 
Recommendation:
So which charger is right for you? The answer to that is the same as the answer to the question of what the insides of an old person’s pants smell like; Depends. If you need to walk and talk, take a look at the i.Sound. You could also check out the original RichardSolo that we reviewed earlier this year. If you want a pretty-much complete kit for your car and your home and you like to break out into spontaneous presentations or you find yourself caught in the dark a lot, then the RichardSolo 1800 has you covered. Or if you’re looking for a battery that’ll charge more that just your Apple products, perhaps the Kensington Battery Pack would serve you well.

Don’t bother using your MacBook or MacBook Pro without the battery installed unless you’re cool with a huge performance decrease. Gearlog notes that, in the process of doing the thankless task of RAM benchmarks, the MacBook’s performance, as rated using Cinebench, dropped some 37 percent without an installed battery. That is, when plugged into a power outlet without the battery installed—some people do this to extend the life of their battery, having it installed only when necessary—the MacBook suffers quite a bit.
Apple saysthis is a feature, not a bug. The idea is that the MacBook can detect wether or not there’s a battery installed. If not, performance drops in order to “prevent[s] the computer from shutting down if it demands more power than the A/C adapter alone can provide.”
So, unless you’re a glutton for punishment, keep the battery in there.

Generally, 3rd party iPhone batteries add extra talk time and do little extra but the INCASE Power Slider does so much more. Not only does the case wrap the precious iPhone 3G in a protective sleeve, it also adds a mini-USB port for easy syncing and charging. Yeah, it adds some bulk but it also bumps the standby time up to 330 hours and talk time on a 3G network to 5 hours (10 hours on 2G). It is expected to launch this holiday season and will be available online and at Apple Stores for $99.

The Duracell PowerPack 450 with Voice offers a unique twist on the standard portable power source: it tells you what to do.
[T]he step-by-step usage instructions walk you through what to do to jumpstart your car or use the air compressor to inflate a tire.

The Duracell® Powerpack 450 is a stand-alone source of portable power for AC, DC and USB-powered electronics such as a laptop, cordless or cell phone, GPS, lamp, portable light, small tool and small appliance. Simply connect your devices to the Powerpack 450 and its voice technology automatically tells you the estimated runtime for each device.
That’s a pretty handy feature.  Also handy is the inclusion of USB ports on the face, so you don’t need to hunt for the special AC adapter cable for your various gadgets. Available now for about $150.

As I was preparing my review of the MSI Wind earlier today, I noticed that MSI’s product site pulled the notebook down for a bit. It’s back up, but I see that the six-cell battery version of the MSI Wind has been delayed until August now. Last time we reported, it’d been delayed until July. Looks like the battery shortage caused by the fire at the LG plant back in March is still causing some pretty serious delays. 
The three-cell version of the Wind has been released and is available (if you can find one in stock) for $479 — $20 cheaper than the six-cell version.
UPDATE: Now the six-cell version has been pushed out from July to August to September. Just got the following…

CITY OF INDUSTRY, CA – July 8, 2008 – MSI Computer, a leading manufacturer of computer hardware products and solutions, has begun shipping all the pre-ordered Wind U100 notebooks. The Wind, with its speedy new Intel Atom™ 1.6GHz processor, is also on sale at Fry’s and online at http://www.newegg.com, http://www.amazon.com, http://www.frys.com, http://www.zipzoomfly.com, http://www.mwave.com, and http://www.buy.com.  These first notebooks sold will feature Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition and a 3-cell battery.
In September, MSI will begin selling a Windows version of the Wind with a 6-cell battery , as well as the Linux version with a 3-cell battery.  MSI will also carry a 6-cell battery for customers who wish to upgrade their 3-cell battery in late September. 

So the preordered three-cell units should be shipping out now. That’s good. But the six-cell version keeps getting delayed again and again. Let’s hope September’s the latest it’ll get delayed. People holding out for the six-cell version aren’t going to be too thrilled with this news.

67,"Fastmac announces first universal Mac battery charger, TruePower U-Charge",https://techcrunch.com/2008/05/16/fastmac-announces-first-universal-mac-battery-charger-truepower-u-charge/,2008/05/16,"
Back at Macworld in January, my MacBook died in the middle of the keynote and it sucked really bad since I was in charge of pictures. If I were in possession of an extra battery we would have been fine, but I didn’t so I had to scramble around Moscone for an open outlet. Luckily for me, Fastmac hooked me up with an extra battery after the show so things like that wouldn’t happen again. But the only problem is that I have to have the battery plugged in to get it to charge. I have the NewerTech dock, but it’s way too big to travel with and only takes certain batteries, so I’m happy to report that Fastmac has solved that problem once and for all.
The TruePower U-Charge is small, lightweight and easily transportable. It charges up your PowerBook G3, iBook G3/G4, PowerBook G4, MB and MBP batteries independently. It currently only works with the 10.8V chargers, but a 14.4V charger is coming soon. Pick one up now, it’s only $70.

68,Higher battery prices caused by fire at LG plant,https://techcrunch.com/2008/03/26/higher-battery-prices-caused-by-fire-at-lg-plant/,2008/03/26," A fire at LG Chem in South Korea on March 3rd has contributed to a worldwide notebook battery shortage, according to Reuters. Asustek is expected to be hardest hit, as the shortage “could affect up to 40 percent of second-quarter shipments” from Taiwan’s second-largest PC maker.
A Dell spokesperson acknowledged the shortage today and has blamed it for recent replacement battery price increases, but said little more than “We sell battery packs. The prices of those battery packs for people ordering extra batteries have gone up.” In the short term, PC manufacturers may be able to stabilize high battery prices against plummeting flash memory prices. 
The plant isn’t scheduled to resume battery production for another 2-3 months. In the meantime, manufacturers have been able to purchase some batteries from plants owned by Sony and Panasonic while waiting for LG Chem to resume production.

69,Review: Richard Solo Smart Backup Battery for iPod,https://techcrunch.com/2008/03/11/review-richard-solo-smart-backup-battery-for-ipod/,2008/03/11,"
My kingdom for a dead-ass simple way to squeeze a little more juice out of my iPod Touch while I’m gallivanting across the globe living the life of a high-profile technology blogger. I need all the battery life I can get while I’m flying in fancy airplanes to conventions in such exotic locales as Las Vegas, Las Vegas and, of course, Las Vegas. 
So does the Richard Solo (made by Sharper Image founder Richard Thalheimer) make for an easy-to-use, no nonsense backup battery? In my best impression of Marv Albert to date; “YESSS!!!”

Overview and Features

The Richard Solo is a rechargeable lithium ion battery that comes with a retractable USB zip cord and a wall plug. You can charge the battery via the wall or your computer. What’s more, you can plug the battery into the bottom of your iPod and charge BOTH devices at the same time (see below). The iPod will fully charge first, then the battery.

The battery works with any iPod with a 30-pin connector (basically everything but the Shuffle) and provides “up to double the battery time,” according to the manufacturer. 
Pros
This thing is great. I especially like it because my iPod Touch didn’t come with a wall charger so this thing basically provides me with that functionality PLUS it works well as an external backup battery. It’s solidly built, too. It’s made of really hard plastic (I think). It almost feels metallic. 
It takes maybe an hour or so to charge the Richard Solo battery, and then once hooked up to a completely-drained Touch, it replenishes the device’s battery in about an hour and a half. Plus, you can use the Touch while it’s being recharged so it’s almost like having an instant second battery with you at all times. This thing is PERFECT for weekend trips. You don’t have to bring your laptop and iPod cable to recharge your device. Just snap this little guy on and you’re good to go.
Cons
It adds a little bulk, of course, and the $50 price point might seem a little high depending upon what kind of iPod you have. If I had an iPhone, though, there’s no doubt in my mind that I’d have one of these in the car (if I had a car) and one of them in the office (if I had an office). This thing would make for a killer phone charger. 
See what I’ve done? I turned the cons section back into pros. It’s that good.
Conclusion
If you’re looking for the best way to pretty much double the life of your iPod and the $50 price tag doesn’t scare you off, I can wholeheartedly recommend that you buy one of these. If you’re an iPhone owner, you should have one of these no matter what.

71,Toshiba develops industrial five-minute charging battery,https://techcrunch.com/2007/12/11/toshiba-develops-industrial-five-minute-charging-battery/,2007/12/11,"
Busy, on-the-go forklift operators are about to get the gift of a lifetime in Toshiba’s forthcoming quick-charging industrial batteries. Starting in March, it’ll take a paltry five minutes (five minutes!) for the ""new battery for forklifts, construction machinery, and other industrial use"" to charge to 90% capacity. You could have a smoke and hit the Biffy and your rig would be good to go by the time you got back. 
The battery technology will make its way into electric cars in the next few years as well.

72,NewerTech Intelligent Battery Charger/Conditioner Review,https://techcrunch.com/2007/09/26/newertech-intelligent-battery-chargerconditioner-review/,2007/09/26,"
Over the course of the year since I’ve had my MacBook the battery life has plummeted each month regardless of whether or not I calibrate the battery. I’m not whining about it, but less than two hours doesn’t leave me with enough time to do anything if I’m working somewhere without an electrical outlet or when I’m in a foreign land and forgot my adapter at the hotel room. It happens to us all. The smart thing to do would be to have an extra battery on hand, but that’s not always the case.
My biggest gripe with the MacBook has been its tendency to die when it says I have 20 minutes left. There’s nothing that irritates me more than this. It shuts down at the most inopportune times and I just want to throw it out the window. But now that I’ve had the NewerTech Intelligent Battery Charger/Conditioner Station for a few weeks my frustrations have subsided.
The charging station holds two batteries in case you have that many and it also calibrates them so you can get the full potential of your batteries. I was skeptical at first, but now my sole battery lasts around 2.5 hours and doesn’t die until the battery meter hits 0:00. The IBCS does a deep discharge and recharges your battery for maximum efficiency so make sure you have an alternate machine to work on since it takes about 12 hours to do. Just plop it into the left bay and hit the calibrate button. You can even drop the other battery in the next bay to charge, but you’d be a crazy person to leave your beloved off for so long. To get a full charge takes less than three hours.
It’s a bit pricey at $150, but if you have an extra battery and you’re just not the diligent type to do the battery calibration every month then your money wouldn’t be going to waste. It actually does what it’s advertised to do and that’s all that really matters. But we’ll see how it works out in the long run.
You can also purchase one for your MBP, PowerBook G4 and iBook G3/G4 for the same price.
