In a move highlighting the growing importance of electric charging stations to utilities, Italian power giant Enel has bought a small, fast-growing California developer of charging stations and power management software.
Through its EnerNOC subsidiary, Enel acquired San Carlos, Calif.-based Electric Motor Werks for an undisclosed amount, in a transaction that could be a harbinger of things to come for a new generation of grid storage and power management software companies.
“Electric vehicles have the potential to be one of the most disruptive technologies the modern electricity grid has faced in the last one hundred years,” said Francesco Venturini, head of Enel’s Global e-Solutions division, in a statement. “The electric mobility revolution is leading utilities, grid operators, and consumers to rethink traditional business models, invest in new infrastructure, and roll out new solutions to provide flexibility and resiliency to the grid.”
Driving the acquisition is a flurry of news over the past few months as carmakers have committed to moving their fleets to full or hybrid-electric drive trains.
In fact, Volvo and Jaguar Land Rover have gone so far as to say that their entire fleets of vehicles will be electric or hybrid-electric by 2019 and 2020, respectively.
The road to this electric vehicle future is being paved by announcements from some of the world’s biggest economies of their intention to ban the sale of diesel and gasoline cars. So far, France and England are looking at a ban on combustion engines by 2040, while India and China, the world’s most populous nations, are also planning a ban on gas vehicles within the next 20 years.
Utilities are responding to the changing nature of vehicle fleets and the fuel that will power them. In fact, in this year alone, utilities in California have proposed over $1 billion for residential and commercial charging networks for electric vehicles.
With eMotorWerks, Enel gets a developer of charging technologies, which also acts as a white-label supplier of charging technologies, as well as a software solution for managing power and distributing it across a grid.
Through partners like Clipper Creek, AeroVironment and Volta Charging, and its own charging station sales, eMotorWerks has deployed roughly 25,000 systems, according to the company’s chief executive Val Miftakhov.
What differentiates eMotorWerks from other charging companies like EvGo, which was acquired by the private equity firm Vision Ridge last year, is its focus on residential — rather than commercial — charging stations.
By buying eMotorWerks, Enel picks up more than just a network of home chargers. It also gets a power management and load balancing system. Through the actual installed chargers that eMotorWerks manages it has access to roughly 10 megawatts of storage at peak power times available for sale to utilities as they need them, according to Miftakhov.
The power management software that the company has developed allows it to manage when cars on its network will recharge… meaning that it can act as a load balancer for utilities, drawing down power from renewable sources when demand is lower, and feeding power into the grid for load management during demand spikes.
“The California grid is divided into zones and each of the zones has its own pricing,” says Miftakhov. “We organize our energy groups by zones, categorize the load and use the information to go back to the grid operator and tell the utility about flexible capacity and we can use that to balance the grid.”
Issues of power management and control will be critical as more electric vehicles are added to the grid.
“[As] EV adoption grows, utilities must either add more infrastructure to meet energy demands or adopt smart-charging solutions,” said Miftakhov. “eMotorWerks’ solution minimizes EV emissions and remotely optimizes charging load, which can reduce peak demands and increase the likelihood that EVs charge on cheaper and cleaner renewable energy.”
Indeed, recent reports indicate that local distribution points may not be able to stand up to the increases in energy demand without some sort of power management system.
A report from FleetCarma, a logistics and networked fleet management technology developer, outlined the breadth of the problem. Typically, electric vehicles require the same amount of power as a small household to make a roughly 30-mile round trip. That puts a lot of stress on transformers, which manage the distribution of power among neighborhoods.
According to the FleetCarma report:

Some studies suggest that higher penetration rate of electric vehicles increase transformers’ loss-of-life factor, even by up to 10,000 times. And this comes with a hefty price tag. The Sacramento Municipality Utility District, for example, has recognized that about 17% of the company’s transformers may need to be replaced as a result of EV-related overloads, at an average estimated cost of $7,400 per transformer.
There are some attempts made to help the utilities plan ahead and avoid serious and long-term degradation of electricity reliability. California and Texas, for example, are considering notification systems that inform power companies when a citizen buys an electric car in their service area. Other jurisdictions may follow suit.

While adoption of electric vehicles is strongest in California, where a combination of subsidies and ample charging stations make owning an electric vehicle simple, utilities in the Midwest and East Coast are also plotting for their electric vehicle future.
Two years ago, Kansas City Power & Light adopted a $20 million electric vehicle charging program that made the utility’s region an EV mecca. And earlier in October, Virginia joined the EV powertrain with its own plans to issue a request for proposals for its own electric vehicle charging network.
“There’s a little movement afoot here in the middle of flyover country,” Chuck Caisley, KCP&L’s vice president for marketing and public affairs told NPR a few months ago. “We’re awfully excited about the prospect of this kind of transportation, and so we wanted to be catalytic to that.”
As Bloomberg’s Gadfly notes, utilities should be ecstatic about the prospect. If the world goes to electric, that means as much as 20 percent growth in demand for power.

Let’s just take light-duty vehicles with a short wheel base (not heavy trucks or buses), of which there were about 190 million on the road in 2015, according to government figures. For the sake of simplicity, replace them all with a full battery-electric vehicle that gets 3.5 miles per kilowatt-hour, loses 10 percent of the power it takes as it charges and discharges, and travels 13,000 miles a year.
Presto! You’ve basically created an entirely new center of demand for power rivaling the entire industrial sector of the U.S.

Enel certainly thinks the highways of the future will be traversed by EVs and that the company’s future in part depends on it.
“Our mission is to be on the cutting edge of this paradigm shift, where consumers can play a more active role in energy generation and use,” says Venturini. “This acquisition enriches our e-mobility offering and integrates a highly sophisticated smart EV charging solution within our portfolio of grid flexibility services, which includes the world’s largest demand response network, distributed energy management systems and battery storage solutions.”

1,Toyota’s ‘Fine-Comfort Ride’ fuel cell concept aims for long-range flexibility,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/18/toyotas-fine-comfort-ride-fuel-cell-concept-aims-for-long-range-flexibility/,2017/10/18,"
Toyota is debuting a new concept vehicle for the forthcoming Tokyo Motor Show, and it’s a fuel cell vehicle that’s designed to get around 1,000 km (around 621 miles) on a single hydrogen pack that can be refuelled in about 3 minutes total. The concept looks like an aggressively future-styled minivan, though it’s billed as a “premium saloon,” and it’s got an interior design that emphasizes second row seating space.
The Fine-Comfort Ride is designed to be flexible in its seat configuration, so that it can use used maximally by just one occupant, or rather as a meeting or communication and collaboration room for a group.

It’s also got a virtual Agent built into touch displays on the driver and passenger windows and screens, for a full surround infotainment experience. The motors are in the wheels, positioned at the absolute outside edges of the car, too, which Toyota says makes for silent running and quite operation.
There are also no dividing pillars separating the front and rear seats, and the bucket seating looks like lounge furnishings from a Blade Runner movie. It’s actually a super cool vision of future mobility, albeit probably not a particularly realistic one.
Toyota should have plenty more to show off at the Tokyo Motor Show next week, so stay tuned for more big reveals, and hopefully more far-out concepts.

2,KarmSolar introduces solar energy to sunny old Egypt,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/26/karmsolar-introduces-solar-energy-to-sunny-old-egypt/,2017/08/26,"

Ousta, Egypt’s ride hailing app, lands a $1.25 million investment
Ousta is driving ride-hailing expansion in Egypt




With over a population over 90 million strong, a prime location, topography and climate, one would assume a country like Egypt would be perfect for solar energy.
The nation’s average level of solar radiation is between 2,000 to 3,200kWh per square meter a year, but this country on the verge of the African Sahara still imports enough gas to operate electricity generating plants all over the country and solar energy is more myth than reality in warm, sunny Egypt.
Things are beginning to change. The Egyptian Ministry of Electricity and Energy has set a goal in 2014 to supply 20 per cent of electric energy demand through renewable energy resources by the year 2020. However, most related projects are focused on wind as a power source and not solar energy.
To date, the only solar power project in Egypt is a 20 megawatt piece of a larger 140 megawatt solar thermal and combined cycle power plant.
For a true solar project, the only developer is KarmSolar, an Egyptian solar technology company focused on sustainable, environment friendly and cost efficient energy solutions, currently operating its station from phase 1 of the Feed In Tariff (FiT) program of the Egyptian government. It is a 2.2 MW station in Sahl Hashish in Hurghada, a resort city on the red sea.
KarmSolar was founded in 2011, the most turbulent year in recent Egyptian history, and yet it has still managed to quickly become an off grid solar energy integrator and the sole provider and developer of high capacity solar pumping stations, especially for the agribusiness sector.
Demonstrators in Egypt in 2011
Five years later, KarmSolar (Arabic for fruit yielding vine) has expanded into other applications including a patented technological breakthrough that supports the use of solar energy in pumping water to farmlands at a fraction of the cost of currently used electricity powered pumps.
Ahmed Zahran, the chief exeuctive and co-founder of KarmSolar says, “While KarmSolar counts as the sole provider of solar energy in Egypt, we hate that status, we see the future of this and we want more people in on it.”
With their patented “Maximum Power Point Tracking” algorithm, the company is now able to lower cost of solar pumping drives significantly whether in design, manufacturing and building.
Randa Fahmy, the company’s head of research and development (and another co-founder) says, “The end product was much costlier because we used to have the software and hardware components both imported, we now manufacture some of the components locally which creates an easier entry point for clients.”
She adds “In a poverty-stricken country that is mainly based on agriculture, large organizations, SMEs and even individual farmers today have a lower entry point to the use of solar water pumping solutions.”
Building
Another subsidiary currently operating under the same umbrella is KarmBuild, which is an architectural design & build firm with a focus on energy efficient and environmentally sustainable building designs.
Zahran says, “We created KarmBuild with a vision to become the only company in the region to actually integrate solar energy technology into buildings’ design through working with a wide range of environmentally sourced materials and training architects on the makings of eco-friendly solar energy powered buildings.
While this sounds appealing in a region where “eco-friendly” doesn’t usually spring to mind in crowded, semi-industrial, business oriented cities like Cairo, Zahran is optimistic about using the startup to create more off-grid environments like in agriculture or tourism related communities. But, he has no illusions about cities like Cairo or Alexandria when it comes to going off-grid.
“(These cities are) too crowded, too dependent on gas powered electricity and too anti-change for anyone to try.” He adds that his company’s work has mitigated around 22 tons of carbon dioxide in a country that is still to weigh in the importance of preserving natural resources and offset carbon emissions.
Eco Communities for the win
As KarmSolar and its subsidies work on educating large sectors on going off-grid, EFG-Hermes leasing has announced a strategic partnership that effectively offers lease financing solution for solar energy projects in Egypt especially smaller industrial and tourist communities.
Zahran says, “We have lowered the cost significantly whether in going off-grid or in building renewable energy based projects, whatever is done, solar energy is relatively expensive and at least much more expensive then government subsidized gas enabled power, the only solution was to get a major corporation like EFG-Hermes to go in and finance projects.”
He adds, “The barriers to renewable energy need to be broken and solar energy must become accessible in a country, environmentally speaking, ideal for anything solar.”
The aim is to have penniless independent farmers and small workshops completely operating on solar energy especially with the startup’s faith in promoting solar powered batteries that offer a 100% complete payback on investment in less than 4 years.
Zahran reiterates, “The beauty is creating solutions like this is that, much like solar energy, the technology is here to stay. Is that a beautiful risk to take?”

Tech Hubs and More
The last interesting piece of news is a collaboration between KarmSolar and Riseup Summit to create, this year, a sustainable growth oriented solar powered Technology Hub in Sahl Hashish, a resort off the Red Sea, around 277 miles away from Cairo. The hub will be welcoming entrepreneurs from all walks of life to build companies and products and live in a completely clean innovative community away from the hustle of main cities.
The CEO adds, “I think this is the best way to invent in Renewable energy, to create a community completely dependent on solar power yet isn’t primitive or under-funded like people here usually assume when it comes to this kind of sustainable projects.”

3,"In India, an Uber for farm machinery aims to make a difference in rural areas",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/15/em3/,2017/08/15,"
Uber has inspired countless businesses to adopt its asset-light and on-demand approach to their industries. The examples are countless. Food delivery, dry cleaning, jet planes, home services rental bikes, or even phone chargers to name but a few — but how about farming equipment?
That’s the case in India, where a startup called EM3 AgriServices is helping rural farmers literally get their hands on specialist (and expensive) equipment and machines that would ordinarily be out of their reach. The goal is to help them earn their livelihood with cutting-edge tech without breaking the bank.
The concept is actually quite straightforward. EM3 works with farmers who own equipment like tractors, harvesters and other mechanical implements by allowing them to ‘rent’ out their assets to help pay off the purchase or generate additional revenue. Farmers, typically those in remote regional with small holdings and limited capital, then get access to quality implements and machines on a pay-as-you-use basis on either an hourly or acreage pricing.
That’s important when most farms in India are smaller than three acres. Tight economics, and a reliance on loans to make big-ticket purchases, are thought to be a key factor responsible for a high level of suicides among farmers over the past twenty years.
“The average Indian farm holding is just one percent of what you’d find in U.S., so farmers aren’t able to afford technology, even basic mechanization, because the capital load is too high,” EM3 founder and managing director Rohtash Mal (pictured above) told TechCrunch in an interview.
And he should know. Mal, a 63-year-old self-confessed “corporate world veteran,” started EM3 with his son Adwitiya Mal (CEO) in 2013 after a spell in charge of agriculture machinery manufacturer Escorts gave him a glimpse into the struggles of Indian farmers.
“In the farm equipment business one thing became clear, we did everything we could to help customers buy our products, but the fact is that the small farm could not afford the rate of technology,” Mal senior said.
“We’re inspired by what happens in tech world, but this hasn’t been done in agriculture before. The need wasn’t there in a lot of markets, such as the U.S., which were the foundation heads of technology, but the need is here in India,” he added.
The company calls its business farming-as-a-service — or Faas.
Unlike Uber, which has pioneered an online business model, EM3 is ‘tech-enabled’ rather than ‘tech.’ That’s to say that while it uses common on-demand tech to manage supply-demand, customer data and more, the majority of its business is offline. That’s because, quite simply, its customer base remains disconnected from the internet.
“The majority of farmers are not on smartphones,” Mal junior said. “The smartphone penetration is increasing but it isn’t at critical mass yet so we have a physical on the ground presence.”
So where there are apps for those ahead of the curve, EM3 operates call centers for handling requests from farmers — both inventory owners and prospective renters — and it deploys local representatives in the villages that it serves. But even the select farmers who are online and own smartphones find something comforting and secure about talking to a person on the other end of the phone when it comes to business matters that impact their life, the EM3 execs said.

To date, EM3 has focused on central parts of India where it claims to have worked with 8,000 farms through its 10 service centers. Mal senior explained that its platform covers machinery and services that span all seasons, but customer activity levels do vary during different parts of the farming calendar and based on location, crop type, etc.
The startup recently partnered with the local government of Rajasthan, India’s largest province by size and a major agriculture producer, to make a push into helping thousands more farmers. It is planning further forays, too, after raising significant funding from investors.
EM3 closed a $10 million in Series B financing led by Global Innovation Fund and VC firm Aspada which will be put to work expanding into more regions, increasing its inventory and developing tech. EM3 previously raised a $3.3 million Series A round led by Aspada in 2015.
Further down the line, Mal senior said he can envisage its business moving into other areas of a farmer’s business where it believes it can add value.
“There’s no other company [offering this service yet, but I’m sure there will be me-toos,” he said.
“We are still significantly ahead, but will have to add more and more to the menu of services to keep our lead. We want to become more dedicated to the farmer and look for more opportunities in farming and adjacent spaces.”
Already there is competition with Gold Farm and Trringo, a subsidiary of automotive conglomerate Mahindra & Mahindra, opening similar services over the past year.
Interest in agritech in India has heated up in recent years. Earlier in 2017, Accel backed AgroStar, a startup that offers a range of guidance and e-commerce services targeted at rural farmers, in its first deal in the sector. Plenty of other VCs in the country have expressed their interest about getting into the space, which has the potential to harness the power of technology to help many farmers in a profound way.

4,Honda Clarity grows from one-shot to series,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/22/honda-clarity-grows-from-one-shot-to-series/,2017/06/22,"
For years, the Honda Clarity has been one thing: a hydrogen fuel-cell-powered sedan available for lease to a vetted group of early adopters in California. Now in its third generation, the Honda Clarity fuel-cell car is still basically that. But it’s getting a couple of friends.
This year, the Honda Clarity adds two new versions: an all-electric car and a plug-in hybrid. Granted, the fuel cell Clarity is technically an electric car, but the electric version charges at any outlet rather than being fueled at a so-far rare hydrogen fueling station.
The three were shown together for the first time in the United States since their unveiling at the New York Auto Show at the Drive Revolution event in Portland, Oregon. Journalists had the chance to drive them back to back to evaluate their similarities and differences over short urban routes — and to compare them to their energy-efficient competitors. There are, of course, similarities in the design; these are all Clarity models. There are subtle differences in the grilles, and they have badging specific to their drivetrain type, but otherwise they are identical large four-door sedans.
This one-car-many-powertrains strategy is one other manufacturers are using, as well, especially when it comes to advanced drivetrain technologies. Hyundai, for example, has the Ioniq series, with hybrid, PHEV and EV versions. As Natalie Kumaratne, a Clarity specialist for Honda, pointed out, this makes it easier for manufacturers to respond to changes in consumers’ buying habits.
Right now, PHEVs are gaining in popularity, and the Clarity PHEV will be available in all 50 states. The Clarity fuel cell is only available in California because that’s where the infrastructure exists to make these cars practical. The Clarity EV is somewhere in the middle of that mix. When hydrogen stations become more widespread, or when EV demand reaches a tipping point, the mix can change at the factory in Japan more easily than if these were separate models.
Driving dynamics for the three cars are very similar, but ranges are wildly different. The EV has a range of about 90 miles per charge; the PHEV drives 42 miles on electric power alone and 330 miles with the gasoline engine; and the fuel cell can travel 366 miles, the highest range of any zero-emissions vehicle in the country.
Kumaratne noted that Honda is all in on fuel cell technology. The company sees it as a major part of its electrification process, and it has set a goal of selling 75,000 total Clarity vehicles in the United States in the next four years. That’s part of its larger goal of having 60 percent or more of its sales worldwide be electric vehicles by 2030.

5,"Pointing the way to the power grid of the future, Drift launches a low cost utility in New York",https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/31/pointing-the-way-to-the-power-grid-of-the-future-drift-launches-a-low-cost-utility-in-new-york/,2017/05/31,"
Meet Drift, the startup that’s hoping to change the way people pay for, and receive, the resource that makes modern life possible — power.
Using a combination of machine learning, predictive analytics, energy management, and high-frequency trading tools, the Seattle-based company is looking to provide its customers with lower cost power, and point the way to the future of the U.S. power grid.
Utilities have struggled for years to implement technologies that will make the generation, distribution and management of power cheaper and more efficient. But billions of dollars of investment in legacy infrastructure have held back progress.
National residential electricity prices have risen nearly 50% since 2003, according to a statement from Drift citing the Energy Information Agency.
The power that utilities generate (or buy) to service a region is based on a rough estimate made 24 hours earlier of how much power a particular geography will need based on average monthly energy use from the previous year
Utility companies estimate how much electricity they will need to power the market for a given day 24 hours beforehand.  Those estimates are based, in many cases, on a rough combination of average monthly energy use in the previous year and citywide weather forecasts for the next day.

For Drift chief executive Greg Robinson, the fact that that process hasn’t been updated in decades is absurd.
“I have been obsessed with electricity and power my whole life,” Robinson tells me. “I grew up on a farm in upstate New York outside of Watertown… The one thing you can guarantee that everyone would complain about was the power bill.”
Robinson met his co-founder, Ed McKenzie, when he was at the University of Washington looking for a bassist. McKenzie was an engineer at Google Maps at the time and he and Robinson shared a mutual love of music and a mutual fascination with the power industry.
After graduation, Robinson worked for Questar Energy Systems, a company that made solar tracking systems and remotely managed solar energy systems. “I thought I could save the planet one solar system at a time,” Robinson joked.
Soon he realized that developing systems and managing them for individual consumers wasn’t going to move the needle on reducing energy prices for everyone.
His thesis, eventually, was to give individual consumers access to the same tools that big utilities have to manage their power loads and expenses.
The issue is this… on a grid scale there are tools that exist to make sure that power flows relatively smoothly and that the lights are kept on for customers, but none of the benefits of those technologies trickle down to the customer level.
Utilities are worried about keeping gigawatts of energy moving around a system so the lights stay on for everyone. Lost in that calculus is making sure that the process is the most efficient and cheapest for the small homeowner or business that uses that power.

To change that equation, Drift has applied for and been licensed as a utility in New York. As a new utility Drift is a market participant that can manage electricity for its customers by trading with commodity owners, independent power producers, and companies like Con Edison to get power to its customers.
In a sense, through a network of small power producers, Drift can bring the same kinds of on-demand power movements that utilities use to keep lights on to keep prices down for subscribers to its energy service.
“Today we’re starting definitely in the US stripping out the experts and the middle men from the supply chain first and then connecting all the disparate, underused energy resources.”
“Sixty percent of the energy we make goes unused [in the US],” says Robinson. “Our solution to that is price responsive and demand elastic.”
What that means is that while utilities and independent system operators are often calling on large power plants known as “peakers” to power up and generate electricity to met unforeseen spikes in demand (or telling companies to power down their generators in an effort to keep the power flowing through power lines balanced), Drift is doing the same thing with companies and houses with off-grid generation sources to bring prices down for its network of customers.

When someone signs up for Drift, they put in the type of property they’re in and their address and select what kind of power they want (either from a mix of renewable and fossil fuel generators, or purely renewable).
Drift will then monitor their power consumption throughout the day and bring on additional micro-power generators to modulate the cost for consumers.
In the private beta the company ran before its general launch today (in New York), Drift saved customers an average of 10% on their utility bills and savings can reach 20%. Those numbers may increase over time.
The way the company makes money is through a monthly subscription fee that it charges customers for their power. The company keeps costs down and makes a profit off of the difference between the amount of money a customer spends per month and the bulk power purchases that Drift spends on supplying customers with power. (Those numbers are for a mix of fossil fuel and renewable power… pure renewable energy costs roughly the same as a regular utility bill, Robinson said).
How much does all of this cost? Robinson said a subscription to Drift amounts to roughly $1 per week.
To finance its efforts to become a utility (available in every state that allows independent utility operators), Drift has raised $2.1 million in financing led by First Round Capital. Other investors in the round include Lerer Hippeau Ventures, SV Angel, Liquid 2 Ventures (run by football hall of famer Joe Montana), Third Kind Venture Capital, Acequia Capital, Kal Vepuri, and Joshua Schachter.
As for Drift’s big vision, Robinson says the company is just getting started. “We’re turning the users that were renting the power system into owners of the power system.”

6,"Kuang-Chi invests $5 million in SkyX, a maker of drones to monitor oil and gas pipelines",https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/22/kuang-chi-invests-5-million-in-skyx-a-maker-of-drones-to-monitor-oil-and-gas-pipelines/,2017/05/22,"
Shenzhen-based Kuang-Chi Group is investing $5 million in SkyX Systems Corp., according to the drone tech startup’s founder and CEO Didi Horn. A former fighter pilot with the Israeli Air Force, Horn started SkyX in 2015 to help public and private companies monitor energy infrastructure from on high, using increasingly powerful drones and big data analytics.
Horn said, “Our model is about acquiring, analyzing and delivering critical data.” The company does not have plans to use its long-range drones to haul goods or people around, he confirmed.
SkyX has developed proprietary SkyOne drones that employ a fixed-wing design and helicopter-like features to take off and land on small charging stations set up in the fields alongside oil and gas pipelines. The stations shelter the drones from bad weather and theft while charging them.
SkyOne drones can fly long distances autonomously, leaping from station to station, beyond the line of sight of human operators wherever it is legal to do so. Using SkyX’s operating system, SkyOS, organizations can create easy-to-read maps and graphics from the data that their drones gather by scanning structures below.
The SkyOS system also can remotely dispatch fleets of SkyOne drones to survey specific points of interest or any areas that have shown signs of trouble in earlier flights. Horn claims that SkyX systems save energy industry businesses 70 to 90 percent of the budget they’d typically spend on monitoring and data using ground-based systems and manpower, and pilots in planes.
The company’s investors, Kuang-Chi Group, may not be a household name in the U.S.,  yet, but the Shenzhen-based conglomerate is known in China and the aerospace industry for its efforts in the new space race. The company’s Kuang-Chi Science division wants to bring people (and possibly payloads) to sub-orbital space by lifting them with a huge helium balloon attached to a pressurized capsule. The system is reminiscent of that in development by Tuscon, Arizona-based World View Enterprises.
Kuang-Chi Group also has established a $300 million venture fund to invest in entrepreneurs outside of China. This fund has established a presence in Tel Aviv to source deals. Besides SkyX, the early-stage venture arm of Kuang-Chi has also backed the voice analytics startup Beyond Verbal, computer vision developers EyeSight and video analytics firm AgentVi.
Given the $5 million investment, Horn said SkyX will begin rolling out its drones and services to more customers throughout North America this summer and fall. Its first two customers, which the startup did not have permission to name yet, are based in Western Canada and will commence using SkyX technology in July.

7,Mercedes home storage batteries coming to the US,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/18/mercedes-home-storage-batteries-coming-to-the-us/,2017/05/18,"
Mercedes-Benz Energy announced that it’s teamed up with Vivint Solar to provide batteries for storing energy at home in the United States, starting in California this spring.
Last year, Mercedes started a program in Germany that works almost exactly the same way. Mercedes uses the automotive-grade batteries it’s developed for electric vehicles, which can withstand a lot of charging and discharging cycles. The company partnered with utilities and solar companies in Germany to store surplus energy for later use in the home.
This is exactly the same kind of system. When new customers hire Vivint Solar to install an array of solar cells on their roof, they can choose to add up to eight 2.5 kWh Mercedes batteries. The modular battery systems allows the homeowner to customize energy storage depending on how much energy is being captured and used.
The batteries work as a backup if the grid goes down, but they also allow users to make the most of their solar energy. The system can store the energy created during the day for use later, when the sun goes down and energy usage rates often climb.
The main competitor for Mercedes-Benz Energy and Vivint is Tesla, which makes Powerwall storage batteries and now the solar cells. Tesla would like you to charge your Tesla car with energy from Tesla solar cells that’s been stored in a Tesla Powerwall, but you as a consumer are not required to buy into a particular ecosystem. Mercedes and Vivint are only the latest option of what will likely be many more in the future.

9,Climate change economics may trump politics,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/07/as-environmental-battles-shift-to-states-renewable-energy-adoption-could-come-down-to-good-ole-economics/,2017/05/07,"
Last week hundreds of thousands of Americans took to the streets to protest what they saw as the evisceration of environmental legislation and a rollback of US efforts to stem the tide of climate change.
Protests in Washington, Boston, New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Seattle and other American cities coincided with the culmination of President Donald Trump’s first 100 days. Over that period, most of the political victories that the new administration has notched have been around environmental and climate science — chiefly rolling back policies enacted by the previous Obama Administrations.
As battle lines shift to the states from the federal government, local political realities and the new foundations of a profoundly changed US economy may reveal the limits of just how much power the current administration has to change the country’s course on climate issues.
On the political front, a majority of adults in every congressional district across the United States support regulations like limits on carbon dioxide emissions from coal power plants, a 20% renewable power mandate for state utilities, and the regulation of carbon dioxide as a pollutant, according to a study from the Yale Program on Climate Communication.

“States have many many levers,” says Mark Muro, a senior fellow and the director of policy at the Metropolitan Policy Program at The Brookings Institution. “The Public Utility Commissions are state [entities]. They control land use at the state level and they run arguably our most successful demand-side policies.”
These utility commissions are tasked with controlling the rates that consumers pay for energy. It’s in their interest to keep prices low while ensuring that utilities are building enough new power generation to keep up with demand from homes and businesses.
Energy Costs 
In recent years, price controls have come in the form of energy efficiency initiatives (the demand-side policies that Muro referenced), more natural gas power plants and renewable energy like wind and solar.
Above all of this is a changing American economy that is weighted more heavily to lower emission industries like banking and financial services, computing, healthcare, retail and services, and telecommunications than on traditional manufacturing (it’s worth noting that automotive and oil and gas are still the largest industries in America).
As the US economy becomes less energy intensive, a massive shift in pricing has made emissions-heavy coal power plants more expensive than other, more environmentally friendly options.
“We don’t believe the renewable energy industry is exposed to the volatility of regulation or policies in the U.S. because of the competitiveness that has been reached through technological improvement, efficiency and performance,” says Antonio Cammisecra, head of business development at Enel Green Power.
Still, conservatives in many states are moving forward with legislation to roll back clean energy friendly initiatives locally.
While there’s a possibility that the removal of enough price obstacles could bring coal back into the range of competitive pricing with other power sources over the short term, Muro says, companies that have to invest in power are looking beyond a four-year (or even eight-year) horizon.
“Because of the current cost structures of natural gas vs. coal… regulatory rollback is not an immediate block on progress,” Muro said. “It could become problematic over time or to the extent that natural gas prices drift upwards, that could make the regulatory rollback more successful in its aims in reinstating coal.”
For states looking to reinstitute a coal economy in the interest of job creation, Muro said that any recovery for the coal industry is likely to be jobless. “That is helpful on the extraction side,” he said. “Most of the latest practices will help further reduce the number of employees it takes to extract a ton of coal. Stocks have seen a pop because they will be unleashed on the extraction side to embrace increasingly efficient, cost-effective extraction… which means more robots, more automated trucks, more open pit extraction, more mountaintop removal as opposed to the more expensive underground work.”
And little of the coal that is extracted will make its way into the US grid, because the plants that turn that coal into power are shuttering across the country. Muro doesn’t expect that short-term price fluctuations will impact the decisions to build new coal plants.
“Very little will happen in a three to five year window,” says Muro. “Many of these decisions are made for a 40 year window.”
Renewable energy and the case for jobs 
Beyond the lower prices that renewable energy and natural gas power enjoy, politicians in coal-friendly states would do well to note the overwhelming support that investment in new renewable technologies enjoy nationwide.

A new report from The Brookings Institute indicates that this local support may be critical since renewable energy patent claims (an indicator of new technological progress and potential economic growth) are declining nationwide. Those patents that are being filed — or innovations being made — are also being snatched up by foreign companies, the report indicates.
The share of U.S. cleantech patents owned by foreign companies has grown over the years, raising concerns about the global competitiveness of U.S. companies. In 2001, both U.S. and foreign-owned companies generated about 47 percent of cleantech patents each. By 2016, 51 percent of all cleantech patents were owned by large foreign multinationals, while only 39 percent were generated by U.S. companies. This trend reflects the globalization of cleantech industries, particularly in developed and developing Asian economies urgent about reducing carbon emissions and cornering growing markets for cleantech.
As renewable energy and efficiency becomes an increasingly big business, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean companies are all in and trying to purchase this IP, Muro said.
“Globally this is a huge market,” said Muro. “Truly making America great again is about capturing major positions in the major unfolding industries in the world. This is one where we have a clear path to a strong competitive position and it would be a shame to forego it. These are industries that can drive local employment. They can produce significant innovation going forward and they can contribute to the trade balance and this is a source of U.S. manufacturing expertise.”
Indeed, renewable energy has produced more jobs in the power generation sector in recent years than oil, coal, and natural gas combined, according to a recent New York Times report.
Manufacturing for components for renewable energy production is also, increasingly, a local game, according to the Enel executive, Cammisecra.
“It must be said that most of the industry is local,” said Cammisecra. “Turbines are manufactured in the U.S., and other components are manufactured in the U.S. I don’t see what could drive a policymaker to hurt the industry in the U.S.,” by cutting renewable energy programs.
State’s rights
The Trump Administration’s policies are being celebrated in some states, but in two of the most populous US states, climate change issues are top-of-mind.
Because of the size and strength of their economies California and New York could very well set de facto policies for the nation. California has long been a leader in renewable energy policy, and any company looking to sell products and services in the state need to comply with what are the nation’s most rigorous environmental standards.
This has already led to conflicts with previous administrations that didn’t share California’s environmental zeal.
Thirteen other states have adopted California’s clean air standards (representing about one-third of the US auto market). So even if the broader national standards are rolled back under the Trump Administration, automakers may well decide to maintain their emissions reduction programs.
Industry weighs in
Beyond policy and pricing, many US businesses are already taking climate change into account.
At the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder meeting this weekend in Omaha, Warren Buffett once again reiterated his firm’s appetite for investment in renewable energy projects.
As CNBC reported:

“We have got a big appetite for wind or solar,” Buffett said Saturday at Berkshire Hathaway‘s annual shareholders meeting.
“If someone walks in with a solar project tomorrow and it takes a billion dollars or three billion dollars, we’re ready to do it,” he said. “The more there is the better.”

Reducing energy and materials consumption also slashes manufacturing costs which is leading many companies to institute sustainable policies regardless of federal requirements.
“Many of these are built in as best practices almost independent of regulatory requirements,” said Muro. “Much of the cleantech, advanced-economy-focused companies already embraced these practices as relentlessly trying to drive carbon and pollution out of their supply chains. They see it as a broader consumer appeal and are moving ahead irregardless of the immediate regulatory scrimmaging at the moment.”
Wall street banks and big insurance companies are also pushing policies that encourage businesses to take their climate responses into account.
The insurance industry is beginning to see losses rise from climate related events, and they’d like to encourage customers to do more to address those impacts.
Meanwhile investment funds are beginning to drop fossil fuel stocks. A December report in the New York Times indicated that many big investors smell trouble in their traditional energy portfolios for a number of reasons.
“There’s a whole movement of concern in the investor community for stranded assets,” said Muro. “Climate change is a critical concern of the investor community in many areas… there is a lot that’s not being debated anymore but is being priced in by the investment community or insisted upon by the investment community.”

10,"SkyX drones are half-helicopter, half-plane and built to fly long distances",https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/06/skyx-drones-are-half-helicopter-half-plane-and-built-to-fly-long-distances/,2017/04/06,"
A Markham, Ontario startup called SkyX Ltd. emerged from stealth today to share with TechCrunch details about its unique industrial drone designs. The company’s SkyOne drones take off and land like a helicopter, but fly more like an airplane, with a range of up to 65 miles (105 km) per charge. For drone industry nerds, this means they have both VTOL and fixed-wing elements.
A range of cameras and sensors on board enable SkyOne drones to gather data about infrastructure below and send it back to cloud-based applications for analysis. The drones also launch from and land on proprietary charging stations, called xStations, which close a kind of shell over the UAVs when they are not moving, protecting them from theft. The charging stations do not remove and replace the batteries within the drones, but charge them directly, then send the drones on their way.
Other companies, including Matternet, land their unmanned aerial vehicles on charging stations where their batteries are swapped out for fresh ones. Positioning charging stations along a route can give drones a virtually unlimited range. It’s a design idea we should expect to see until battery tech and other power systems advance significantly.
SkyX designed long-range drones that charge on stations in the field.
SkyX founder and CEO Didi Horn spent his earlier career flying for the Israel Air Force. He told TechCrunch, “I always knew I wanted to develop something around drones and aviation for commercial use when I got out. But in consumer there were already great products. There was nothing great for long-range, but that’s where I knew there would be demand. There are millions of kilometers of oil and gas pipelines already built in the world today and they are all at risk of leaks, or terror attacks, you name it.”
SkyX is targeting the energy industry first, as its drones and charging stations can be configured to cover long distances between pumping stations along oil and gas pipelines. The drones also can be used to cover acres of solar panels installed on vast farms, or wind turbines installed along roads, even in remote areas, Horn explained. The xStations can plug into a typical electric outlet. Or they can be connected to solar panels or other freestanding generators, he noted.
While the company did not have permission to disclose the names of its earliest customers, it is working with several energy companies on safety tests and pilot projects today in the Americas, Horn said. The drones fly autonomously, and the company also has to secure permission in different markets to fly beyond the line of sight of human observers or pilots on the ground.
SkyX only shared renderings and photos of a prototype. The CEO voiced concern over intellectual property, but says the drones are being used in field tests, under human observation, today with some features still under development.
 
Updates: Information was added to this post about the range that one SkyX drone can fly on a single charge.

In the novel Desperate in Dubai, Ameera Al Hakawati wrote:

“Dubai is… after all, a lonely, transitory place. It’s hard to maintain relationships when people are always coming and going.” 

Two years ago, during my first time in Dubai, I agreed. After attending a UN conference there, admiring the city’s glittering, intergalactic architecture, visiting the Gold Souk and then riding a camel for 30 seconds in the desert, I felt myself searching for something beyond the glamour and sand.
Given that Dubai’s combined expat and migrant worker population is 92 percent of the total number of people living in the city-state, I expected to experience a city deeply rich in diversity beneath its “skyline on crack.” But instead I sensed a society filled with dichotomies and devoid of identity.
During my second visit in February, I felt a shift in the city’s energy and a glimmer of community, largely due to its burgeoning innovation economy. With Dubai making efforts to be the first city fully on blockchain and programs like Dubai Future Accelerators and Accenture’s FinTech Hive grabbing attention, the city’s tech sector is reaching new heights. And with Smart Dubai and His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates and Ruler of Dubai, prioritizing happiness as part of a citywide transformation, the urban desert is cultivating its own modern renaissance for its citizens.
As for the non-citizens, I’m not so sure. Given the ongoing controversy over the years around the treatment of Dubai’s migrant workers, some activists are questioning whether or not a happiness renaissance will be inclusive or strictly for the affluent and privileged.
According to the Human Rights Watch World Report 2016, low-paid migrant workers in Dubai and throughout the UAE have been subjected to abuses that constitute forced labor while building the country’s magnificent skyscrapers. A number of migrant workers, who are predominantly Southeast Asian and live in slums, reportedly earn as little as AED 700 (£127) a month.
Who will Dubai’s happiness agenda include? Only time and data will tell.

The World Government Summit
In February, happiness was a key initiative discussed at the fifth annual World Government Summit (WGS) in Dubai, where 4,000 people from 139 countries representing governments, academia and the private sector gathered to dive into global challenges, including climate change, health, education and the rise of populism.
Surprisingly, there wasn’t too much talk of Trump’s America. Unsurprisingly, there was plenty of buzz about Elon Musk’s musings on society’s need for a universal income.
Like most government- and business-focused conferences, there weren’t many women speakers, an issue I hope similar Dubai events address in the future if the city intends to create a culture rooted in happiness. We’ll see if having a woman overseeing the happiness agenda makes a difference. Ohood Al Roumi was appointed as minister of state for happiness a few days before WGS began.
Overall, the role of technology and science in addressing some of the world’s toughest problems was a central theme.
Health and technology
While there was no shortage of nations represented at the event, the UAE and Dubai were (unsurprisingly) in the spotlight. A panel of health experts said the UAE is poised to be the health capital of the world, thanks to its investment in new technology. According to the Future of Health Index 2016, which measured the readiness of citizens in 13 countries to deal with new models of healthcare delivery and treatment, the UAE ranked first.
It’s worth noting that the definition of health capital is subjective. If you’re looking at healthcare affordability, Mexico, Colombia, Costa Rica and Malaysia register with top grades.
As far as healthtech goes, however, the participants at WGS say the UAE can’t be beat. While making this argument, Arjen Radder, CEO of Philips (Middle East and Turkey), discussed a new invention called the bio-center that patients can attach to their to chests to measure eight different vital signs, allowing doctors to monitor their levels remotely. Later, Dr. Shamsheer Vayayalil, founder and managing director of the multi-specialty Dubai-based hospital, VPS Healthcare, spoke about how he’s aiming to turn the healthcare sector into more of a wellness sector, and leveraging technology to see a shift from “break-and-fix” to “predict-and-prevent.”
The future of climate change and technology
For participants who got a chance to break away from the lofty conversations of the event, the Museum of the Future installation, which was organized by the Dubai Future Foundation as part of WGS, provided a vision exploring how countries can be forward-thinking about remedies for climate change. Considering 2016 was the hottest year ever, if governments and tech clusters across the globe aren’t looking into climate change solutions, we’re in trouble.
The installation featured tech concepts, including a DNA seed printer, an aquaculture farm with genetically engineered living jellyfish and an AutoFarm — a robotic urban farm filling empty parking garages with food, thanks to self-driving cars making garages unnecessary.
“The world needs to produce 70 percent more calories by 2050 in order to feed itself,” says Dr. Noah Raford, COO of the Dubai Future Foundation. “This kind of growth is possible, but requires a new approach to the food industry. Growing food closer to home will be an essential ingredient to healthy cities.”
Raford pointed out that irrigation, fertilizer and pesticides increased yields for millions of farmers over the last 50 years. “It fed millions, but also brought pollution, degraded nutrition and energy-intensive supply chains,” he says. “These are bad for the environment and bad for our health. The food systems we imagined in the 2017 Museum of the Future will produce food locally using much less energy and water and with much better taste and nutrition.”
The idea of a desert paradise like Dubai producing its own food is hard to visualize. Then again, imagining a city with all of its documents on blockchain by 2020 and a world that provides a universal income is no small feat. But like its spectacular skyline, the ideas spawned and nurtured in Dubai are never realistic. And the fact that the ideas come to fruition has people coming and going more often — so much more that plenty are staying longer than they originally intended.
Perhaps this means they are happy.

12,Tesla co-founder and CTO JB Straubel explains its new solar storage facility,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/17/tesla-co-founder-and-cto-jb-straubel-explains-its-new-solar-storage-facility/,2017/03/17,"

Tesla’s new solar energy storage facility on the Hawaiian island of Kauai does what most solar power plants cannot: it stores energy from the sun during peak times for use when the grid (and its customers) needs it most. The facility is unique, with 52 MWh of storage capacity and 13 MWh of generation via its field of panels.
We spoke to Tesla CTO and co-founder JB Straubel, who oversees the company’s commercial energy concerns as part of his expanded role now that Tesla owns SolarCity, the solar power company it acquired late last year. Straubel explains that this Kauai plant is a proof point for Tesla: The company has now demonstrated that it can provide this kind of solution at a scale where it’s useful to utilities around the world, not just on sun-drenched islands in the Pacific.

13,Tesla’s Kauai solar facility will offset 1.6M gallons of fuel use per year,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/08/teslas-kauai-solar-facility-will-offset-1-6m-gallons-of-fuel-use-per-year/,2017/03/08,"

Tesla’s Kauai solar power facility is officially open for business as of Friday, with a 13 MW SolarCity solar farm installation providing power to a Powerpack storage facility with 52 MWh of total capacity. The beauty of the new facility, in terms of the specific needs of the sun-soaked island in the Pacific, is that it can capture energy from the sun during peak daytime production hours, and then keep that power ready for peak consumption hours at night.
This is a relatively new reality for solar power generation, made possible by Tesla’s Powerpack tech, which is essentially the commercial version of its Powerwall home storage batteries. Hawaii is already a big solar power consumer, which makes sense for the same reason it makes sense that the state is such a draw to tourists, too. But Tesla’s initiative is the first to answer the problem of peak production time overlapping almost exactly with times where need for power is at its lowest.
Tesla’s new solar facility in Kauai isn’t going to completely reduce its dependence on fossil fuels — the island will still rely on diesel shipped in to provide some of its power requirements. But the new facility will offset some of that use of dirty burning fuel, reducing overall usage of fossil fuels for power needs by around 1.6 million gallons per year.
The new energy project was developed by Tesla for the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative, and it’s the biggest solar storage facility in the world, according to KIUC president and CEO David Bissell. It occupies a field that was once used to grow sugarcane. The project is a key part of Hawaii’s goal of using 100 percent renewable energy by 2045, and for Tesla, it’s the perfect way to demonstrate how it can deploy these kinds of facilities to fit similar needs around the world.

KIUC’s Tesla solar plant uses Powerpack 2, Tesla’s second-generation commercial storage, which is made at Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada. The project began with an RFP issued by KIUC in 2014, which led to a year of discussions between itself, Tesla and Grove Farms, which owns the land upon which it’s built. In 2016, the companies struck a deal and Solar City brought Tesla in as its storage supplier — then later that same year, Tesla acquired the solar energy provider.
Tesla’s hoping that the example of what it’s done in Kauai will act as a roadmap for what it can do for other commercial energy providers around the world. It’s also a key proof point for why it made sense to tie up Tesla and SolarCity via their merger last year.
Tesla CTO JB Straubel said that the unique aspect, and the most important, with this facility is that it’s the first time that a solar facility can deliver really reliable power delivery 24 hours a day, and operate when it’s needed most. It’s also a necessary step toward achieving 100 percent renewable energy sourcing, he says, since without the ability to defer power delivery the most you can ever hope for is 20 to 30 percent. He added that it’s a sign that they’re ready to truly deliver fully scalable facilities to suit the increasing size of demand across markets.
It can easily scale the other way, too, according to Straubel. He said at the launch that they’re seeing more customers who are looking to Powerpack for single-site energy backup, and also highlighted Powerwall, which offers the same to residential customers.

Straubel also stressed that Tesla wants to provide an “integrated, collaborative approach” to energy production and supply along with utilities, rather than espousing an “either/or approach,” which is a very sensible stance to take when you’re presenting alongside a utility company partner and client.
Hawaii governor David Ige also spoke at the event, highlighting the Hawaiian people’s commitment to renewable energy sources, which he says they see clearly “are the future.” He added that “storage is the challenge” for the state, despite abundance of renewable sources, including geothermal, solar and more. “The challenge is making energy available when the consumer needs it,” Ige said, which is why the project is something that the state found so attractive.
Ige said that he truly believes companies like Tesla who are willing to raise and invest funds in the task of making renewable energy affordable for everyday consumers are the way forward in achieving the state’s 100 percent renewable power goals.

14,Kado wants to make the world’s thinnest charger,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/28/kado-wants-to-make-the-worlds-thinnest-charger/,2017/02/28,"
What can you wrap up in ribbons? Stick in your sock? And what can you take out in public and not get thrown in the dock? The Kado phone charger, of course. This new product by Itay Hasid and Daniel Assis is making the rounds at MWC and is essentially the “world’s thinnest wall charger for smartphones.”
Obviously a wall charger isn’t that exciting but the pair raised $1.2 million to create a nearly flat wall charger with collapsible contacts and internal circuitry to manage the charge. It is about as thin as a USB port and it can charge laptops as well as mobile devices.
“Kado chargers are designed to be ultra-thin so that they can fit into a wallet, a purse or a laptop sleeve without creating a bulge,” said Hasid. “Though trends such as fast charge offer a perception of painless charging, they actually limit users’ mobility, forcing them to charge with big, heavy and fixed location chargers. Kado was envisioned to give users more freedom by simply being able to easily carry their chargers with them.”
The company is raising a Series A round to complete commercial launch in 2017.
Basically the Kado does away with the wall wart allowing you to run around with your laptop, a cable, and a thin charging brick. There are two models – the Sleeve for laptops and the Wallet for mobile devices – and they should be shipping later this year. Isn’t it awfully nice to have a charger?

15,MIT creates an intelligent power supply that lets hardware sip energy,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/21/mit-creates-an-intelligent-power-supply-lets-lets-hardware-sip-energy/,2017/02/21,"
Researchers at MIT have created a power supply for small electronic devices that “sips” energy by turning devices on with packets of energy rather than a steady stream.
Most power converters release a steady voltage. This means they’re generally inefficient for small devices like sensors and other devices that don’t need to be constantly on. The MIT’s Microsystems Technologies Laboratories has created a power supply that can send power as needed, falling back into a “quiescent” state as necessary.
“Typically, converters have a quiescent power, which is the power that they consume even when they’re not providing any current to the load,” said Arun Paidimarri, formerly of the MTL. “So, for example, if the quiescent power is a microamp, then even if the load pulls only a nanoamp, it’s still going to consume a microamp of current. My converter is something that can maintain efficiency over a wide range of currents.”
The converter takes inputs of up to 3.3 volts and reduces them to .9 volts. “It’s based on these packets of energy. You have these switches, and an inductor, and a capacitor in the power converter, and you basically turn on and off these switches,” said Paidimarri.
This means a sensor can turn on, check for a certain state, and shut off. Further, this can happen over and over again and the IoT device only sucks in a tiny amount of power – enough for the sensing and the calculation.
It’s quite a clever solution. In short, if the device is only sensing and doing nothing else then only a few “packets” of energy will be released. If the device is transmitting, said the researchers, “it might need to release a million packets a second.” This means you can run part of a device at low power and only activate the high-energy parts as necessary. Ultimately they’re seeing a 50 percent repudiation in power usage which could make it far easier to control and power IoT devices on limited amounts of energy.

16,Energy giant AES partners with Measure to improve worker safety with drones,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/07/energy-giants-aes-partner-with-measure-to-improve-worker-safety-with-drones/,2017/02/07,"
Major power producer AES Corp. is ramping up the use of drones with an eye toward shielding workers from industry hazards. Rather than buy all their own unmanned aerial systems, they’ve engaged D.C.-based drone services provider Measure to get access to a more extensive fleet. Measure recently raised $15 million in venture funding.
According to its Vice President and Chief Technology Officer Chris Shelton, AES has flown drone missions in 10 countries. It also has a reasonable inventory of drones that it uses at power plants and projects. Working with Measure will allow AES to get newer and more drones on short notice, along with pilots to help run them, wherever they are needed.
Shelton said, “We find that using drones, we can reduce the number of hazardous hours that it takes to do certain types of maintenance. And we can also enhance the efficiency of the business.” According to the U.S. Department of Labor, workers in the electric power generation business face a range of hazards, from electrocution to falls, fires and explosions.
Using drones, AES employees can remotely inspect a tower or transmission line, for example, and gather high-resolution data about what’s going on there, without having to scramble up scaffolding. AES also uses drones for inspection of solar panels, alleviating workers of a need to walk vast fields taking precise measurements.
Last year, AES ranked among America’s biggest water and air polluters, according to two separate studies by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts, and a Center for Public Integrity investigation, respectively. Hopefully, the company will find ways to put drones and data to work reducing carbon and chemical emissions affiliated with energy production and distribution.
Although AES employs 21,000 people and operates in 17 countries, its drone use near-term will focus around power plants and projects in the U.S. and Latin America, Shelton said. Based in Arlington, Va., AES started using drones a couple of years ago when the available drone technology had advanced beyond RC’s and flying cameras to include new mapping and sensing capabilities.

17,GM and Honda partner to mass produce hydrogen fuel cells in Michigan,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/30/gm-and-honda-partner-to-mass-produce-hydrogen-fuel-cells-in-michigan/,2017/01/30,"
Automakers GM and Honda are teaming up on a new venture to jointly manufacture hydrogen fuel cells at scale, with plans to start mass production by 2020 and a combined investment of $85 million split evenly between the two companies dedicated to the effort. Both GM and Honda intend to use the resulting hydrogen fuel cell system in future products, according to the companies.
The joint venture, which will be called Fuel Cell System Manufacturing, LLC, will build the fuel cells at GM’s existing Brownstown, Michigan-based battery pack construction facility, where it currently assembles battery packs for its Volt and Bolt EVs.
GM has been working on hydrogen fuel cell technology for quite some time across a number of industries. It’s working with the U.S. Navy on a fuel-cell powered submarine drone, for instance, and it’s also been developing a Colorado ZH2 test truck for the U.S. Army with a fuel cell powertrain that has a lot of flexibility when it comes to mission-based use.
Overall, the company has invested around $3 billion in development of fuel-cell tech, and is looking to field a fuel cell vehicle for consumers as soon as 2020. GM announced a partnership with Honda to develop production fuel cell technology back in 2013, and their timelines were remarkably similar to the one announced today. The companies also revealed their new, much smaller and more compact fuel cell design.
Dan Nicholson, VP of Global Propulsion Systems at General Motors said at a press conference announcing the joint venture that “we can safely say that today’s announcement officially marks the arrival of fuel cells.”

Honda has a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle available already, in the FCX Clarity. The sedan will be joined by two other models, a fully electric and a plug-in hybrid, later this year.
By combining their efforts, Honda and GM are hoping to help drive manufacturing costs lower, faster. Demand for fuel cell systems across both automakers will help boost scale, and since the two are collaborating on sourcing, they’ll be able to achieve better prices for components from suppliers, too.
Fuel cell technology has significant advantages in terms of range and efficiency vs. both traditional fossil fuel vehicles and purely electric options, with advantages when it comes to refuelling times vs. electric charge.

Ford has begun testing of its new Transit Custom Plug-In Hybrid with Transport for London, working with the UK city’s local transit authority to pilot 20 of the new vehicles in use during a 12-month trial with select London businesses for commercial use. The pilot of the vehicles, which feature a pure electric range of around 31 miles according to European agency measurement standards, is designed to pave the way for broad production and sales in Europe beginning in 2019.
The Plug-in Hybrid Vehicle (PHEV) version of the Transit is one of 13 total new electric or hybrid vehicles that Ford will introduce globally over the course of the five years, including a hybrid Mustang, F-150 and other cars to be announced later. The 20 PHEV Transit vehicles in this pilot are expected to be able to cover the majority of their daily use on their electric motors, Ford says, since their internal city routes to deliver goods or answer service calls shouldn’t typically exceed that capacity.
Development of Ford’s test fleet for the London trial is supported by a £4.7 million ($5.8 million U.S.) grant from the UK’s Advanced Propulsion Centre, a government-funded research facility that was created in 2013 in partnership with industry to advance low emission alternatives to fuel-burning engines. London has also committed to creating an “Ultra Low Emission Zone” in the city core by 2020, which will incur a fee on any vehicles that exceed tight carbon output standards.

19,This battery is powered by bacteria,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/23/this-battery-is-powered-by-bacteria/,2016/12/23,"
Researchers at Binghamton University in New York have created a “bacteria-powered battery on a single sheet of paper.” The project is aimed at creating batteries for disposable microelectronics that can run for weeks using a little bacteria-rich liquid.
“The manufacturing technique reduces fabrication time and cost, and the design could revolutionize the use of bio-batteries as a power source in remote, dangerous and resource-limited areas,” write the researchers.
The researchers used a piece of chromatography paper and a ribbon of silver nitrate under a layer of wax. The anode was made of “a conductive polymer on the other half of the paper” and a reservoir held bacteria-rich liquid. The cellular respiration powered the battery.
You’re not going to power your car with these but you will be able to squeeze out a little juice. The batteries expel “31.51 microwatts at 125.53 microamps with six batteries in three parallel series and 44.85 microwatts at 105.89 microamps in a 6×6 configuration.” The researchers believe these batteries can run glucose sensors, detect pathogens, or keep small electronics alive for days without traditional power supplies.
Interestingly this isn’t the first bacteria battery his team has made. The team “developed its first paper prototype in 2015, which was a foldable battery that looked much like a matchbook.” The best part? “Earlier this year they unveiled a design that was inspired by a ninja throwing star.”

21,Arcadia Power launches a solar energy service for renters across the U.S.,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/03/arcadia-power-launches-a-solar-energy-service-for-renters-across-the-u-s/,2016/11/03,"
The renewable energy services company Arcadia Power has just launched a new product that allows renters across the U.S. to buy renewable energy.
It’s a significant step forward for the renewable energy project developer and operator, which had previously integrated with utilities as an offset provider and load management company. And it’s potentially a game changer for the renewable energy movement.
I’m going to unpack that a bit because it gets a mite confusing. Before this announcement, Arcadia was offering services that would offset customers’ energy use with an equal investment in a renewable energy project (typically a wind farm).
Now, because of the company’s partnerships with utilities and status as a project developer, it has amassed a small group of projects through which it’s offering renewable energy investment to folks across the country who would want to install solar, but can’t.
Arcadia’s logic is simple. There are a number of renters or non-homeowners who would like to be able to invest in sustainable energy, but don’t have the means.

“That’s one of the most important parts of what we’re doing,” said Kiran Bhatraju, the chief executive of Arcadia Power. “The vast majority of Americans can’t do rooftop solar. There’s only about 8% of Americans that can.”
Those people are barred from such direct investments in a solar project because they live in multi-tenant houses, and can’t just throw up a solar panel anywhere they want.
Using Arcadia, these environmentally minded consumers can invest in projects across the United States and reap the benefits of that energy generation as if it were coming from their own home.
“We built technology over the last few years that allows us to push bill credits onto their utility bills,” said Bhatraju. “We can remotely connect you to a distributed generation asset. As that solar produces electricity we take the billed credits locally and that’s distributed onto the bill.”
Arcadia’s current projects aren’t huge, but they do prove that commercial customers and governments are buying into their thesis — if you offer renewable energy generation to renters — they will come.

The company posits that while there’s a will for renewable generation, consumers still don’t have a way that’s convenient enough for them to make the switch to solar power. Arcadia’s offering changes that.
So far, the Arcadia Power has projects in Washington, DC, Massachusetts and California. “We source the project and we work with the customers to get the buy-in into the program.”
For Bhatraju, the new offering is just the next step along the path that the company charted back in May when it raised $3.5 million from BoxGroup and Wonder Ventures.
When the financing was announced in August, Arcadia had 10,000 customers on its premium offer, matching customer usage with renewable energy at 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. The company also launched a free 50 percent wind option to people who wanted to split their bill between traditional utility power generation (typically coal and natural gas) and wind power.
The next product in the company’s pipeline is on-bill financing for energy-efficient products like smart thermostats and LED lighting, which Arcadia says can save customers between 10 percent and 30 percent of their annual energy costs.
Today, the company is rolling out its service with about 250 kilowatts worth of projects (enough energy to power roughly 41 homes, according to estimates by the Solar Energy Industries Association). According to Bhatraju, there’s another 2.5 megawatts of power in the pipeline.

22,Judge dismisses riot charges against Democracy Now! cofounder Amy Goodman,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/17/judge-dismisses-riot-charges-against-democracy-now-cofounder-amy-goodman/,2016/10/17,"There may be hope for the First Amendment rights of new media journalists― a North Dakota judge has dismissed riot charges against Democracy Now! cofounder and investigative reporter Amy Goodman.
As TechCrunch reported this weekend, Goodman was charged for “participating in a riot” after she reported from the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota, on the long-running protests there against the development of a $3.8 billion energy project called the Dakota Access pipeline.
The pipeline specifically impacts the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in North Dakota and its 8,000-person reservation. Native American advocates say that the project will not only put safe drinking water at risk for the Standing Rock Sioux, but will also destroy their sacred burial grounds.
Goodman captured and broadcast footage of Dakota Access-affiliated security guards using pepper spray and attack dogs against Native American advocates and environmentalists.
Beyond matters of tribal rights, the pipeline raises profound ecological concerns.
Oil and petroleum pipeline spills have been on the rise in the U.S. since 2009, along with domestic oil consumption and production. The spills are caused by everything from corrosion, to welding or equipment failures, but also natural disasters and human errors.
Uncowed by the court, Democracy Now! has continued its reporting at the protest front lines.
Goodman is not the only journalist state prosecutors attempted to silence over pipeline protest coverage in North Dakota. A documentary filmmaker named Deia Schlosberg was taken into custody, and later released, but with her footage confiscated and still facing possible felony charges in the state.
She was arrested while filming demonstrators at the tar sands pipelines in Wallhala, North Dakota. The protestors shut down TransCanada’s Keystone pipeline there.
Charges against Schlosberg included “two Class A felony charges and one Class C felony charge, and conspiracy to theft of property, conspiracy to theft of services and conspiracy to tampering with or damaging a public service,” according to a blog post on EcoWatch written by Josh Fox.
Schlosberg was a producer for the Fox-directed documentary called How to Let Go of the World and Love All the Things Climate Can’t Change.
We have reached out to Schlosberg for an update on her situation.

23,"Looking to leapfrog the power grid, d.light raises $22 million for solar in emerging markets",https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/21/looking-to-leapfrog-the-power-grid-d-light-raises-22-million-for-solar-in-emerging-markets/,2016/09/21,"
The development of mobile payment platforms, increasing options for providing debt, and cheaper and better off-grid solar power systems are presenting countries around the world with a chance to leapfrog the archaic electricity infrastructure that defined the twentieth century.
Looking to take advantage of these powerful emerging trends, d.light, a startup founded by two Stanford Business School alums, has raised $22 million in its latest round of financing.
The company was launched at the height of the first push by young entrepreneurs into renewables in the 2006-2007 timeframe.
For d.light, inspiration for its initial product came from an accident that d.light’s co-founder Sam Goldman witnessed during his time working with the Peace Corps in Benin.
Goldman witnessed an accident involving a neighbor’s child who accidentally knocked over a kerosene lamp, spilling the fuel on himself and suffering third degree burns across his body.
Goldman had seen similar lamps all his life while moving from country to country as a child. When he returned to the states for business school, the idea of creating a low-cost, solar-powered replacement for the lamp became his focus.
Business school was where he met Ned Tozun, who had similar dreams of changing the energy and power mix in emerging markets.
Ned Tozun and Sam Goldman, co-founders of d.light
From that first solar-powered lamp, d.light has expanded its product suite to include everything from a solar powered energy kit for an entire home and… soon… low-powered televisions.
The evolution of the company’s business has come with an explosion of interest in off-grid power for emerging markets.
Indeed, d.light’s success mirrors that of its one-time business partner, M-KOPA Solar in Africa. Both companies depend on the development of mobile money payment systems in Africa and both have used debt to bring their products to market.
According to Tozun, d.light is able to sell their products more cheaply and in more markets, because their systems aren’t tied to a single telecom carrier the way that M-KOPA’s solar arrays are linked to Safaricom in Kenya.
For d.light that was by design so the company could sell its array in several markets.
At their core, both systems operate in the same way. M-KOPA and d.light both provide solar panels, converters, lights, cell phone chargers (and eventually other low-power appliances) through an installment payment plan that can be financed through direct loans from the company or through micro-financing from local lenders.

By not using a single sim card interface, Tozun said that the company could expand to parts of Asia and Africa that are not as consolidated as markets in Kenya and Nigeria.
Through its partnership with M-KOPA, Tozun said d.light has installed roughly 120,000 of its systems before M-KOPA cut its ties with the company and began manufacturing its own equipment.
“One of the things that the business model provides that M-KOPA doesn’t is that it’s a fundamentally lower cost structure,” said Tozun. “We’re in the same places as M-KOPA we’re 20% cheaper,” he said.
And while M-KOPA has been able to consolidate a position in Kenya with its home kits, Tozun argues that d.light has fostered more brand awareness and loyalty in other markets through the sale of its $5 basic solar-powered light (Goldman’s kerosene lamp replacement).
Even the basic market for replacing kerosene lamps is huge. Roughly 2 billion people burn kerosene in lamps for light. At $5 per lamp, that’s big money for any vendor.
The issue, said Tozun, is the flood of cheap products that have soured consumers on solar goods. Without quality controls, countries with large solar manufacturing capacity and lax product safety laws have flooded Africa with low cost, low quality products.
That makes it tough for a company to compete with a premium product. However, once d.light is in a customer’s hands, the brand loyalty is intense. “Other pay as you go guys are focused on systems,’ said Tozun. “We’re focused on getting people on to the very first rung.”
Upselling quickly follows. “We’ve sold 2 million units into Kenya of the off-grid lights,” Tozun said. And that’s led to success with its power systems.
The new $22 million in funding will help d.light build out a sales network for its “totally proprietary” technology platform, Tozun said.
Led by KawiSafi Ventures and Energy Access Ventures, along with follow-on investments from NewQuest Capital Partners (which picked up DFJ Asia’s stake in d.light), and some impact investors, the new round will also help finance the commercial rollout of the company’s new low-power television sets.

“We’re seeing this transition from impact capital to really sophisticated commercial capital and I think that’s a really healthy thing for our industry as a whole,” said Tozun. “I think particularly in the last year or two I’ve seen a pretty big shift in the way people talk about solar whether it’s policymakers or investors.”
Big government money is pouring in from the West. For instance, there’s Power Africa, which was set up by the U.S. Agency for International Development. It’s a $43 billion public and private U.S. initiative to develop renewable power in sub-Saharan Africa.
“Economically it’s a no-brainer to go to solar where solar is able to leapfrog the grid in the same way that mobile has leapfrogged landlines,” said Tozun. “It’s so expensive to build the grid out to get to customers… essentially when we have these systems that we sell to customers and we couple them with really energy efficient devices.”
An entire solar power array, costs $25 down and 40 cents a day for a year. After that, the system belongs to its owners. Then, d.light tries to upsell the consumer with a second system or one of its new white good products (a TV to start, but soon, a fan or a fridge).
For consumers in the States, don’t worry. The company’s products are for sale on Amazon. While Tozun doesn’t believe that there’s much demand for off-grid systems in the mainstream american energy market, there are applications on “the fringe of the grid.”
According to him, the next target for the company are the billion people who have “unreliable” connections to the grid. “That’s the next market,” Tozun said.

24,Black female founder raises $7 million for renewable energy tech startup,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/19/black-female-founder-raises-7-million-for-renewable-energy-tech-startup/,2016/09/19,"
I’d like to tip my imaginary hat off to Jessica O. Matthews, the black female founder and CEO of renewable energy tech startup Uncharted Play. Her company just closed a $7 million Series A round led by the NIC Fund with participation from Kapor Capital, Magic Johnson Enterprises, BBG Ventures and Lingo Ventures.
With the new injection of funding, Uncharted Play plans to build out the team and better equip itself to support the partners the company is bringing on in the coming months. Uncharted Play’s mission is to spread awareness about global energy and clean power through technology and play.
The $7 million investment in Uncharted Play makes Matthews the 13th black female founder who has raised more than $1 million in outside investment. Earlier this month at Disrupt SF, Morgan DeBaun of Blavity said that she’s raised over $1 million in funding and is still actively raising. DeBaun was the 12th black female founder to raise over $1 million.

In the tech ecosystem, black female founders receive basically zero venture capital. Of the several thousand venture deals that went down from 2012 to 2014, less than 1 percent of them went to black women, according to a recent report by #ProjectDiane. And the black women who received outside funding on average only got $36,000, while the average seed deal size in February of this year was $4.5 million, according to CB Insights. At the time of the #ProjectDiane report, only 11 black female founders had raised more than $1 million in outside funding.
Uncharted Play’s first product, SOCCKET, is a soccer ball that doubles as a power generator. The SOCCKET uses the rotational energy that gets generated every time the ball rolls to produce three hours of light for every hour of play.

Uncharted Play’s second product is the PULSE, a jump rope that doubles as a light. Both the SOCCKET and PULSE are powered by MORE (motion-based, off-grid, renewable energy, Uncharted Play’s proprietary technology for micro-generator systems. Those systems can integrate into anything that moves, which is what transforms the product, like a soccer ball or a jump rope, into a source of off-grid power. Uncharted Play’s goal is to better utilize kinetic energy in order to complement or even replace other energy systems.
Uncharted Play’s business model entails partnering with product manufacturers across industries like consumer electronics and infrastructure to put the MORE technology inside the everyday products we use, like strollers, shopping carts and suitcases. The idea is that you could then use the energy produced by that product to charge your cell phone and other things.
“We not only aim to disrupt how energy is generated, but how it is consumed,” Matthews said. “We envision a world where people shift from a ‘hoard & save’ energy mentality to a ‘continuous and on­-demand’ energy experience.”

25,Microsoft says its Edge browser is still more energy-efficient than its competitors,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/15/microsoft-says-its-edge-browser-is-still-more-energy-efficient-than-its-competitors/,2016/09/15,"
Once upon a time, browsers were all about getting faster and scoring better on JavaScript benchmarks than their competitors. While speed still matters, many developers have recently focused more on energy efficiency than speed (which makes sense, given that most users now browse on laptops). When Microsoft said that its Edge browser was more energy-efficient than its competitors, like Chrome, Firefox and Opera, it kicked off an interesting discussion.
Today, Microsoft is back with new numbers based on the latest release of Edge in the Windows Anniversary release. Unsurprisingly, Edge still outperforms its competitors (including Opera with its special energy-savings mode turned on). The new version of Edge, Microsoft claims, is now also 12 percent more efficient at rendering pages in the company’s simulated browsing tests. Every other browser also showed some improvements in these tests, which just goes to show why we need competition in the browser ecosystem.

As for Microsoft’s results this time around, the company says using Edge can make your laptop last 23 to 69 percent longer than other browsers. Chrome, which also recently got a lot of efficiency related updates, still performs significantly better than Opera and Firefox. In one of Microsoft’s tests that looked at how long the laptop lasts while streaming video, Edge outperformed Firefox by 62 percent.
The source code of Microsoft’s testing suite is available on GitHub. Given that Microsoft is only looking at browser performance on Windows 10, these tests obviously don’t include data for Safari. Apple, though, would likely argue that its browser remains more energy-efficient than its competitors on OS X, too.
I’m pretty sure I’ll receive responses from Opera, Mozilla and Google soon after this post goes up and I’ll update this story once I hear from them.

26,Elon Musk reveals Tesla’s master plan,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/20/teslas-master-plan-part-two-is-huge-for-the-company/,2016/07/20,"
Elon Musk plans to steer Tesla towards fully autonomous driving, car sharing, and cargo transport, according to the long awaited blog post on the company’s website. A fully solar power ecosystem driven in-part by SolarCity will help Musk and Co. get there.
Musk has been teasing the master plan part II for days. What would be in it? Would Tesla cars fly? Would they go to space? What does Lana Del Rey have to do with it? Why is Elon Musk talking about crack on Twitter?
After a near infinite number of browser refreshes, we now know.
For a quick breakdown, check out our gallery: The 7 steps of Elon Musk’s “Master Plan”
Tesla is doubling down on not just autopilot but full autonomy. To get there, Musk expects a total of 6 billion miles of test-driving will be needed. Right now, fleet learning is happening at 3 million miles per day.
Tesla is also prioritizing development of heavy-duty trucks and high passenger-density urban transport. These products will be unveiled over the next year. The Tesla Semi specifically will support cargo and transportation services. The driver role is expected to transition to one of a fleet manager. A Tesla ecosystem of smaller connected utility vehicles including busses would be able to provide convenience, increase road safety and reduce traffic congestion. Such a system benefits everyone, not just the technocratic elite. Additional capacity, door-to-door service, and non-cellular methods to interact with the system would benefit groups yet to be touched by traditional ride-sharing.
The company is taking a page from Uber and Lyft and raising them with artificial intelligence. Tesla sees itself taking on qualities of a transportation company but rather than a human driver, Tesla will come to you autonomously. To supplement an early lack of supply in vehicles, the company will operate a fleet of its own.
“You will also be able to add your car to the Tesla shared fleet just by tapping a button on the Tesla phone app and have it generate income for you while you’re at work or on vacation, significantly offsetting and at times potentially exceeding the monthly loan or lease cost,” said Musk in his post. “This dramatically lowers the true cost of ownership to the point where almost anyone could own a Tesla. Since most cars are only in use by their owner for 5% to 10% of the day, the fundamental economic utility of a true self-driving car is likely to be several times that of a car which is not.”
Pushing to bring down costs for the average consumer appears central to the new plan. Like Ford before him, Musk is prioritizing manufacturing optimization to bring costs down in the upcoming Model 3 and forthcoming vehicles.
In line with Tesla’s updated goals, the company quietly changed its URL earlier this week from Teslamotors.com to just Tesla.com. Tesla is no-longer simply a car company.
Even before the URL change, Musk had been hinting at this shift. In the first part of the master plan released in 2006, Musk described that his draw to the company was a desire “to help expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy.”
Musk deliberately said solar, not wind or hydroelectric, but solar.
Even on this alone, a Tesla acquisition of SolarCity could have been predicted. Musk expanded on his ideas to include a roadmap that has guided the company for a decade.
√ Build sports car
√ Use that money to build an affordable car
√ Use that money to build an even more affordable car
√ While doing above, also provide zero emission electric power generation options
Tesla has done a pretty good job at first targeting customers “prepared to pay a premium,” and then “driving down the market.” The new plan picks up where the old one left off and provides guidance on how electric power can move beyond the car and into the home.

The 7 steps of Elon Musk's ""Master Plan""

Tesla has already started moving into uncharted territory with regards to its development of Powerpack and Powerwall and the upcoming opening of the Gigafactory. Batteries were a small part of Musk’s plan but have grown to be a major focal point of the business. The new plan is to coalesce all of energy generation and storage around a single ordering and installation process. This means Tesla batteries are entering a long term intimate relationship with SolarCity solar panels.
The new plan, focuses on the solar ecosystem as a whole. Lot of new artificial intelligence and machine learning technology has rolled into place over the last decade and Tesla wants to take advantage of that as well.
The new simplified plan looks like this:
Ο Create stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage
Ο Expand the electric vehicle product line to address all major segments
Ο Develop a self-driving capability that is 10X safer than manual via massive fleet learning
Ο Enable your car to make money for you when you aren’t using it
Tesla investors have been patient so far, but that was called into question amidst Tesla’s plans to acquire SolarCity. The company’s stock is worth 13 times its IPO value, but lately has been categorized as a risky investment by analysts. Dreaming big is easier as a startup. The larger a company grows, the harder it becomes to steer the rudder. I’m not one to doubt Musk, and given how accurately he forecasted and accomplished his last plan, others would be wise not to either.

Scott Elrod is a vice president of the hardware systems laboratory at PARC, a Xerox company. 


It’s 6AM and I’m rolling out of bed. But before my feet hit the floor, my “home energy management agent” is negotiating with the California Independent System Operator (ISO), the nerve center controlling the flow of electricity on the grid.
Normally, I’d get my coffee first and then jump in the shower. But my personal agent has alerted me to the fact that a hair-trigger condition has developed! There is a hydro plant in the Sierras getting ready to ramp up production to meet the morning demand. I’ve already told my agent that it’s OK to request that I rearrange my schedule in modest ways, so it’s concluded that if I (and enough other homeowners!) can hold back on energy consumption for 10 more minutes, the hydro turbines won’t need to open, and the reservoir won’t need to be drained further.
[One of my passions is kayaking in the lakes and reservoirs of the Sierras, and I hate to see the water level drop.] As I jump out of bed, a text suggests that I “shower first, then coffee!”
With an aggregate impact of small decisions made by homeowners like me all over the state, we succeeded in averting the need for that reservoir to drain further…at least for today. This vision will become reality. But for now, we lack the ability to directly influence our energy sources, and we certainly have no way to express environmental priorities in such transactions.
When you flipped on your light switch this morning, where did that energy come from? What were the environmental impacts of its generation, transmission and use?
All energy sources have externalities that many of us are passionate about: emissions from burning fossil fuels, groundwater contamination related to oil and natural gas extraction, impacts on fish migration for hydropower and desert habitat disruption for solar, just to name a few.
Unfortunately, there is no way, today, for the full set of impacts of our energy use to be collected, and no way for people to express their values and communicate them to system operators, so that they can be incorporated into decision-making.
How would you balance the benefits you derive from your energy use with the true economic and environmental costs, if you had that information and could choose exactly where your energy comes from?
There are, though, emerging technologies that will alter these legacy dynamics. Instead of captive consumers with few energy choices, we are fast becoming active participants in the energy markets as generators, demand-response agents and ancillary service providers. Our energy resource mix is increasingly coming under our control as we put solar on our rooftops and proactively shift our demand from gas-powered to electric vehicles or our home energy mix between electricity and natural gas.
The cost of energy storage continues to decline, promising increased flexibility in the way we use power from renewable sources. New sensing and analytics technologies allow us to monitor and measure environmental impacts and energy use benefits to a degree never before achievable.
These trends are evident as utilities such as Con Edison allow customers to choose electricity only generated by renewables.
Companies like Whirlpool and others are making smart appliances that interact with Nest thermostats to reduce energy by helping consumers find the best time of day to run. And, commercial-building owners can make money providing demand-side control and ancillary services through network aggregators like EnerNoc.

As these capabilities proliferate, they have the potential to coalesce into an integrated system with great flexibility and potential for savings, and even the possibility to make money.
While these changes promise opportunity for better energy choices, they may also bring some risk. A comprehensive perspective is needed to provide new frameworks and advanced information systems that can help us manage this complexity and guide us toward diverse energy and environmental policy goals.
The democratization of information energy
There are strong similarities between today’s energy systems and the information technology of the 1960s. The mainframe computer of that era was a valuable shared resource, but due to the non-intuitive interface, control of the computing resource was isolated from the workers who used it to support their tasks.
There was a group of intermediaries, experts in machine language, and end users had to coordinate with them to access the computer. Decisions about utilization priorities, methods and investments were generally far removed from the end users, just as is the case with today’s power grid.
In the 1970s, PARC and other Silicon Valley innovators shattered this model and launched the information revolution with the invention of the personal computer, graphical user interface and Ethernet connectivity.
Together, we developed the technologies and practices that put computing into the hands of business users and consumers, providing unprecedented direct access to information and the ability to optimize computers for specific needs.
This transition from mainframe to personal computing is often referred to as the Democratization of Information. Today, anyone can access knowledge on any subject, irrespective of economic or social status. The economic benefit of this transformation is measured in trillions of dollars, with impacts that have touched every aspect of our society.

Today we see signs that the energy market is set for this type of dramatic disruption.
New technologies and markets are allowing energy consumers to gain direct control over energy resources. It is impossible to predict all of the implications and value that will ultimately be created when control of energy is placed directly in the hands of users, but it is nearly certain that it will lead to a period of tremendous innovation, economic growth and job creation.
This type of disruption is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and the timing couldn’t be better in the context of accelerating our efforts to address impending climate change.
I am a technology innovator, and I’m also a lover of nature. It matters to me where my power comes from and I want to better understand how the little choices I make can improve (or at the very least, not harm) the world I live in and enjoy. What energy choices would you make if you were able?

With icons like Leonardo DiCaprio and Bill Gates using their powerful brands and personal convictions to turn the world’s focus toward the crisis of climate change and the long-lever arm of energy efficiency, it’s time for policy makers and practitioners to get serious about finding ways to take better care of our planet.
In his most recent annual letter co-authored with his wife, Gates went so far as to say we need “an energy miracle” to solve this global crisis.
Turning our attention to buildings as a significant emissions source could be one way to effectively address Gates’ concerns about energy consumption. Residential and commercial buildings account for more than 40 percent of total U.S. energy consumption. Innovation in this arena could have sizable impact on a national energy strategy.
However, a vast majority of the national building stock is privately held and subject to regional market forces and near-term profitability. This is a place where thoughtful state and national policies can play an important role in curbing our national emissions.
While government intervention is often opposed in principle, national building policies actually create long-term confidence to develop innovative building components and design strategies. Take California’s Title 24 Building Energy Code, a great example of how we can reform our building standards to help curb energy use.
Thanks to the energy efficiency standards in this progressive policy, which have continually been updated since 1978, Californians use half the energy of other Americans nationwide on a per capita basis. Furthermore, that same policy has made California an ideal early market for now ubiquitous technologies such as compact fluorescent light bulbs, LEDs, low-albedo roofs and small-scale solar.
When given the choice, owners and renters choose the most efficient buildings available.
California is now ambitiously targeting Net Zero Energy (NZE) for all new residential construction by 2020 and all new commercial construction by 2030. Although some states are beginning to adopt forward-thinking regulations like Title 24, acceleration of building efficiency requirements could make a big dent in energy use, as buildings carry a larger carbon footprint than the industrial or transportation sectors.
In this election year, both sides of the aisle are debating which energy policies should last into the next presidency. While the topic of climate change has become over-politicized, disagreements take away from the real issue at hand and the positive impact the guiding hand of the government can have on the built environment.
On the surface, it can appear putting these policies into action could be harmful to a private real estate market, but the opposite is actually true. As evidenced by collaborations like the Mathilda project in Sunnyvale, California, progressive developers can voluntarily undertake market attractive NZE buildings that cost less to build and rent for a premium. Completed in 2015, Mathilda is a blueprint structure for NZE and Zero Net Carbon building that leverages eight innovative building technologies, including advanced comfort controls and dynamic windows.
These technologies, and their application at Mathilda, demonstrate the power that the Internet of Things, nanotechnology, smart systems and next-generation architectural thinking can have when deployed in concert for the purposes of net-zero construction.

Getting specific, Mathilda offers unique insight into how barriers to green building are being removed:
Profitability. A common objection to high-performance building is the perception of additional upfront costs. While it’s true that initial construction costs were higher, this cost was significantly outweighed by the near-term benefits of reduced operating expenses, accelerated lease-up and premium rent over the life of the occupant’s lease. This is a critical aspect of making sustainable building a practical economic reality.
Flexibility. While new construction is the primary focus of building efficiency policy, it is equally important that existing buildings can be retrofitted to achieve NZE status. Mathilda’s renovation transformed a 40-year-old two-story racquetball club into a Class B+ commercial office NZE structure. This, too, is an important consideration as we think about remaking the built environment on a sustainable model.
Scalability. To achieve true scale, NZE strategies must be broadly replicable. Using an integrated package of “state of the shelf” building technologies, the Mathilda approach has already spawned clones and is applicable for a wide variety of commercial and residential buildings. This requires both technologies and policies to scale.
Projects like Mathilda highlight the ability of the construction industry and building occupants to thrive in a progressive policy environment. Legislators need to recognize that industry is ready for their mandate to make buildings as efficient as possible. Building technology is ready and designers have the experience and ingenuity to use them to their greatest benefit. And, when given the choice, owners and renters choose the most efficient buildings available. With these in place, suddenly Mr. Gates’ miracle seems quite possible.

29,Tado’s Smart AC Control Makes Any Air Conditioner Smart,https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/04/tados-smart-ac-control-makes-any-air-conditioner-smart/,2015/06/04,"
While smart thermostats have been around for years, they typically have only been able to interface with a home’s central heating or cooling system which are much more expensive than portable units. Today, Tado is launching the Smart AC Control, the world’s first device to make any remote-controlled air conditioner smart.
Tado’s device interfaces with over 85% of the world’s air conditioners, including both portable and window units. After being placed near the air conditioner, the system connects to your home’s WIFI, and uses infrared to issue commands to the unit. This effectively allows your phone to replace the cheap plastic remotes that normally come with air conditioners.
Once installed, Smart AC Control allows users to interact with their cooling system much like traditional smart thermostats do. For example you could have the system pre-cool before you get home, and automatically turn itself off to save energy when you are away.
The system will have IFTTT integration and is Apple HomeKit-ready. Additionally the unit will be packed with sensors such as temperature, humidity, light, noise, motion, and and Bluetooth low-energy.
Although the Smart AC is Tado’s first product being launched in The United States, the company has had tremendous success throughout Europe with its first product, the Tado Thermostat. Christian Deilmann, CEO & Founder of Tado, said that Tado Thermostat is the number one selling smart thermostat in Europe.
The unit is available worldwide for $199, and can be purchased directly from Tado’s website.

30,Here Are The First Connected Home Devices For Apple’s HomeKit,https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/02/here-are-the-first-connected-home-devices-for-apples-homekit/,2015/06/02,"
Apple’s HomeKit is finally starting to roll out to actual consumers, via the first crop of HomeKit-enabled accessories from third-party manufacturers. This means you’ll soon be able to get your hands on a range of products for the connected home that work with Siri on your iOS device, and that you’ll be able to do so as soon as today, since some of the new HomeKit accessories start shipping now.
The accessories in question range from sensors, to lights, to thermostats, to smart outlets, and come from a group of accessory-makers with a trusted reputation in the connected home industry. HomeKit may have taken a while to arrive, but it’s doing so in grand fashion, with a practical lineup to get your home connected to your iOS ecosystem in an essential way.
Elgato Eve
The Elgato Eve is a set of connected wireless sensors that monitor key factors like indoor air quality, temperature, humidity as well as conditions outside, like temperature, humidity and air pressure. Four sensors are included in the box, including Room for indoor monitoring, Weather for outdoor stats, Door & Window for checking open/closed status of those entry points, and Energy for checking what’s drawing power and switching them on and off remotely.
Using HomeKit, iOS device users with 8.1 or above can check on all the stats gathered by the Eve from their devices, and even do so when they’re away from home using Apple TV (generation 3 or later with OS version 7.0 or later), thanks to its ability to act as a HomeKit remote hub.
Pre-order for the Even sensors kicks off today, at Walmart.com and Amazon, and you’ll be able to pick them up from the Apple Store starting in July when they hit shelves. Sensors are sold individually at $79.99 for Eve Room, $49.95 for Eve Weather, $49.95 for Eve Energy and $39.95 for Eve Door & Window, and the app is free.
ecobee3
Connected thermostat maker ecobee is adding HomeKit to its ecobee3 hardware, which is designed for houses that have multiple rooms in need of climate control. Remote sensors help it monitor temperature in multiple rooms at the same time, letting you save energy and maximize comfort in every area.
With HomeKit, ecobee3 owners can group actions together for control via Siri, and control things remotely with the Apple TV component. It starts shipping later this month, and will be in Apple Stores, Home Depot, Best Buy and Amazon in July for $249, with additional remote sensors available as add-on purchases for $79 per pair.
Lutron Caséta Smart Bridge
The Caséta Smart Bridge is a wireless lighting hub that makes up a core part of the Caséta Wireless Lighting Starter Kit from the company. This HomeKit version lets users control lights in specific areas, as well as check with Siri to see if lights are either on or off in specific areas of the house you might not be able to see at any given moment.
With HomeKit, you can control specific rooms or groups of lights separately, or turn everything off with voice commands. You can also control things remotely provided you have that late-generation Apple TV.
Lutron’s HomeKit-enabled Caséta Smart Bridge is part of the Lighting Starter Kit that also includes two dimmers (which work with your existing bulbs), two remotes and two pedestals to hold them. It’s available at Apple Stores starting today, with a retail price of $229.95. Additional dimmer/remote combos sell for $59.95.
Insteon Hub
The Insteon Hub with HomeKit allows users to control the whole range of Insteon connected devices from the company, including LED bulbs, plug-in lamps, thermostats, wall outlets, cameras, door locks and more.
And in addition to its full range of first-party products, the company is also now offering up a brand new version of its Insteon+ app for iOS 8.1 or later, which will also work with HomeKit-enabled devices from other manufacturers. Insteon is clearly looking to be a one-stop shop for users looking to create an Apple-friendly connected home, letting you group a range of devices and functions together.
The new Hub is available at Amazon.com and Smarthome.com right now for $149.99, and will make its way to physical retail stores starting in early July.
iHome iSP5 SmartPlug
Accessory maker iHome is getting in the smart home game with a new HomeKit-enabled smart plug model, the iSP5. The smart plug allows you to turn anything that plugs into an outlet into an intelligent device, and to use multiple iSP5 plugs to create “scenes” which turn on or off multiple gadgets at once. The SmartPlug itself is designed to be low-profile, and to allow for two to work in a standard wall outlet at the same time, or to keep one outlet free.
The iSP5 SmartPlug will be on sale in retail beginning in late June or early July, but pre-orders kick off at iHome.com starting on June 15. The plug’s pricing is not yet announced.
HomeKit Basics
In case you’re hazy on the details of HomeKit, here’s a quick primer: Devices that work with the protocol can be controlled via Siri so long as you have their app installed on your device, and are running iOS 8.1 or later. Set up and discovery is handled automatically just by tapping, and you can use groups to control different collections of devices. If you also have an Apple TV (generation 3 or later) you can also control HomeKit-enabled devices remotely, when you’re outside of your home Wi-fi network.
Apple had told us the first HomeKit accessories were coming in June, and this crop of initial partners delivers that. It’s interesting to see Apple announce this ahead of WWDC, the keynote for which is next Monday – it implies they’ve got so much to talk about that a HomeKit partner parade didn’t necessarily fit the agenda.

31,What Is 21.co Really Building? An Excerpt From Digital Gold,https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/18/what-is-21-co-really-doing-an-excerpt-from-digital-gold/,2015/05/18,CONTENT ERROR
32,Consider Pitching A “Virtual Startup” To Your Boss,https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/27/consider-pitching-a-virtual-startup-to-your-boss/,2015/04/27,"
Editor’s note: Steve Sokol is the product lead for Respoke, a WebRTC platform as a service that allows web and mobile developers to add live voice, video, text and data features to websites or apps.
I have been part of several of startups, and I love the energy, excitement and sense of risk that comes with launching into uncharted waters. My last startup was acquired in 2007, and I’ve been working at the acquirer ever since. A bit over two years ago, I got the itch to do something entrepreneurial again.
When I talked with my boss about quitting to build a new business in the nascent WebRTC/web communications space, he made me an offer I couldn’t refuse. And that’s how I landed in my current position: For two years, I’ve had the unique opportunity to work as a co-founder at a virtual startup, housed under the corporate umbrella. The ride is not quite the same as your typical startup, but it’s a long way from business as usual.
If you’ve read The Lean Startup, you know a startup is intrinsically different from an established company. The mission of a startup is to find a business model, and the mission of a company is to capitalize on that model. If you’ve read The Innovator’s Dilemma, you also know existing companies have to keep innovating – sometimes disrupting their own primary business model – if they want to remain relevant as times and technologies change.
As it turns out, it can be really challenging to innovate inside of an existing, successful company. Everyone is busy doing their part to move the existing products and services forward. Everyone is intellectually and emotionally invested in the current model. The sales organization has established channels. The marketing team has a set of customer personas they understand. The engineering team has a mix of skills tailored for the current products. And nobody has the time to disconnect and try to think about a completely new approach.
Large companies solve this problem by acquiring innovative, small companies. Smaller companies have to take a more creative approach.
I work for Digium, a business telecommunications company that launched as a startup in 1999. Digium led a wave of disruption early in the millennium with Asterisk, an open source software project that replaced over-priced proprietary PBX systems with commodity computers.
Digium started out selling add-ons and support, and evolved to offer a full line of business communications products and services. I came aboard in 2007 when Digium acquired my Asterisk-focused training business. After five years working as the product manager and later marketing manager for Asterisk, I was ready for a change and saw WebRTC as the next big wave in communications.
It turns out that Digium had a similar thought. The leadership team recognized both the opportunity and the threat posed by the new technology and wanted to explore its options. I stayed, and within a few weeks had assembled a small team tasked with researching the technology and looking for the opportunities it presented. We spent several months generating plans and MVPs (minimally viable products), which we pitched to Digium’s board of directors. After a couple of iterations we landed on the concept that became Respoke – our web communications PaaS and API.
The idea that we should operate Respoke as a virtual startup gets credited to our VP of Engineering, David Deaton. Having worked at a combination of startups and established tech companies, he recognized that it is hard to successfully mix the two. He proposed the startup structure as a way of giving the new project the flexibility to experiment, and as a means to avoid the distractions that pervade any established business.
Our group moved into an unused section of the company’s headquarters and started building our product. At the time, none of us knew of any other virtual startups, but that changed when we met HubSpot’s Christopher O’Donnell during our early customer discovery phase.
When HubSpot, the Boston-based inbound marketing startup, decided to enter the competitive sales automation space, it chose to launch what VP and virtual founder Christopher O’Donnell terms a “startup-within-a-startup.” HubSpot chose the startup approach for several reasons. The new business was diving into a different market and was intentionally adopting a different go-to-market strategy. Launching Sidekick, the new product, as a startup allowed O’Donnell and his team to test and pivot.
The HubSpot experiment came with very few strings attached. O’Donnell was given three mandates: it had to be for the sales automation market, it had to involve email, and it had to be self serve and no-touch.
The process started out as lean as you can get: O’Donnell worked by himself for the first several months creating and testing hypotheses. Next, he brought in a few engineers to build an MVP. The result were initially validated by letting HubSpot’s sales team give it a try. When the product caught on organically (i.e. without a “you must use this tool” directive from sale leadership) they knew they were onto something.
The story O’Donnell tells is not particularly different from other startup tales. The initial concept required several pivots to find a solid fit. Growth is just as critical. It calls for the iterative approach that O’Donnell describes as “sketching in pencil, then re-drawing in pen.” As an experiment, he views the Sidekick startup as a complete success. In less than 18 months the team was able to create both a new product and a new channel.
Matthew Hodgson of Matrix tells a similar story. Matrix was launched as a “curated startup” by Amdocs, a thirty-year-old multinational company that specializes in billing and directory platforms for the telecom market.
Recognizing a potential existential threat in the ongoing decentralization (and devaluation) of traditional communications, Amdocs created Matrix as something of a hedge. Hodgeson’s team was charged with building an independent ecosystem around an open source standard for federated communications.
Matrix was not the first curated startup from Amdocs, but it may be the most audacious. Creating an ecosystem around an open source product is no easy task (I know – I spent six years working as product manager and marketing director for Asterisk).
Amdocs views Matrix as a “moonshot” – an opportunity (and a gamble) to own the story of their own disruption. It’s the kind of experiment that you can’t do directly with an established company – especially one with 20,000 employees and offices in nearly 70 countries.
“Moonshots” seem much more at home at Google or Facebook than someplace like Amdocs. Hodgeson admits that getting the necessary support and approval for a startup inside of legacy enterprise business is unusual. Matrix had the good fortune of finding a champion at a very high level in the Amdocs org chart. As he explains it, “Without buy-in from senior leadership – preferably at the C-level- it is very hard to succeed.”
Pros and Cons
In theory, a virtual startup is an autonomous group within an established company that acts as a business model generator / validator. The idea is to create enough separation from the parent company that the startup group can hypothesize, experiment and pivot when necessary.
The virtual startup does most of the same things that a “real” startup would: hiring a team, developing a MVP, testing for product / market fit, etc. Once a viable model has been found and validated, the startup transforms into a business unit of the parent company.
In practice, the lines aren’t quite as clearly drawn. There are some huge advantages and a few disadvantages to being a virtual startup.
In a real startup you spend a lot of time looking for money. That’s less of an issue in a virtual startup. Digium understood and acknowledged the opportunity in front of them, so we were able to skip out on much of the fundraising process.
The Sidekick team at HubSpot had the same advantage, though O’Donnell was expected to show actual revenue much more quickly than a traditional startup. Even with that challenge, most would kill to be able to “one-and-done” the fundraising.
A down side to the virtual startup is one of the strengths for a “real” startup – equity. Established companies with existing value have a stock option program geared towards rewarding a combination of high performance and loyalty. Traditional startups, on the other hand, have a huge pool of (initially) worthless stock. It’s far easier for a traditional startup to offer a mix of salary and equity to attract and retain talent.
Virtual startups (including Respoke) have to live within the option program of their parent company, which means the compensation mix is much more heavily tilted towards salary. This isn’t entirely a negative. A salary-heavy blend is often attractive to experienced developers who tend to be able to work “smarter” rather than pulling an infinite series of all-nighters to crank out the product.
Another difference that’s a bit of a mixed bag is the existing infrastructure the parent company can provide. Not having to set up payroll, insurance and other business basics is a plus. But having to make use of existing systems that were selected or built for a different business model can be a challenge. We had to spend a good deal of time integrating with existing accounting and billing systems.
A traditional startup would have built a solution on Stripe or Chargify in half the time. This isn’t a huge deal, but it proves there are limits to how nimble or lean you can run when you’re attached to a larger organization.
Virtual startups generally don’t have to worry about finding office space. The local members of our mostly distributed team simply moved into a section of the company’s existing headquarters. We knew from the beginning we would be hiring remote employees so we also invested some time to build the kinds of collaboration tools that make remote work painless. I’d call both instant office space and remote workers a win for the virtual startup.
Other aspects of virtual startupdom are pretty much the same as the classic model. In the early days, virtual startups spend a lot of time on HR stuff because assembling the right team is critical. They argue (amiably) over the details of the MVP – how “minimal” can it be? (Hint: a bit less than it would be for a classic startup because you don’t want to risk damaging the parent company’s reputation with a spectacular flop.) How do you price it? When do you hire the next engineer? What’s the burn rate? How can we get useful feedback from early adopters? These types of questions are shared concerns no matter what type of startup you are operating.
If you’re working in an existing, established business but long for the excitement of a startup, consider pitching a virtual startup idea to yourboss. It’s an evolve-or-die world, and finding a way to innovate should be on everyone’s roadmap.

33,"uBeam’s Ultrasound Wireless Charging Is Real, And About To Be Really Funded",https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/26/kill-the-cord/,2015/04/26,"
What if wireless power at a distance actually worked? It does. uBeam invented a way to wirelessly send energy up to 15 feet away with ultrasound.
What if you could slap a wireless charging case on your phone and charge it while you move around or use it? uBeam invented that too. While early uBeam prototype were massive, non-portable boxes that merely shot power around, it now has a working version that consumers would want.
And what if your phone could wirelessly charge while you’re at Starbucks because they installed the transmitters? You’d probably be more likely to stop by.
That’s why sources confirm to TechCrunch that major brands are vying to become strategic investors of uBeam in hopes of scoring exclusivity deals so they’ll be the first retail locations to offer uBeam wireless charging. uBeam is seeking exclusive partnerships with the #1 players in several retail verticals.
Starbucks is said to be especially near to striking deals to join a strategic investor round that will close soon, and uBeam is also in talks with the top names like Virgin in air travel, Starwood hotels, and some huge fast food chains. uBeam has also spoken with leading hardware manufacturers like Apple and Samsung.
uBeam’s case will wirelessly charge phones
Meanwhile, traditional venture capitalists are foaming at the mouth over uBeam’s future. Now that it’s product has gone from fantasy, to impractical, to what looks like the future of power in just a few years, they’re ready to throw money at uBeam and its plucky founder Meredith Perry. While it may not ask for much money beyond the strategic round, sources say it’s looking towards a massive Series B that could be around $50 million or more, with a valuation of $500 million or even much higher depending on progress.
When asked, uBeam declined to comment on this article.
The new money would add to the $10 million Series A led by Upfront Ventures that uBeam raised in October, which also included many investors from its $3.2 million in seed rounds such as Andreessen Horowitz, Founders Fund, Ludlow Ventures, CrunchFund (run by TechCrunch’s founder), Troy Carter, Shawn Fanning, Mark Cuban, Ken Seiff, Ellen Levy, and Tony Hsieh.
A lot of smart people believe.
Wireless Power Via Ultrasound
Plenty of other companies have tried and failed to produce true wireless power, with some ending up doing magnetic resonance charging. But that requires devices to be so close to transmitters or even touching, so they may as well be plugged in. It’s linear innovation, not exponential innovation.
However, the buzz amongst prestigious funds is that after due diligence research, many think uBeam’s style of wireless charging will work for consumers and could have utterly massive potential.
A bulky early uBeam transmitter prototype
Specifically, uBeam relies on ultrasonic transduction. Transmitters take power from an outlet or building’s electircal system, convert it into ultrasonic sound waves, and then beam the vibrations towards a device with a receiver, like a phone with a wireless charging case. uBeam’s transmitters can retarget the receivers as they move to maximize the energy transfer. The receiver converts the ultrasound vibrations into energy, which is then fed into the device it’s attached to, charging it. uBeam is said to be able to charge at a similar speed to plugging your phone into the wall.
uBeam’s ultrasound wireless charging has several advantages. First and foremost, it’s safe. These are similar ultrasonic waves used for ultrasound scans of babies in the womb. The receivers are cheap, possibly costing around $50 or less a source says, and slim, so they’re not annoying to attach to your phone. The same waves can also transmit data, which could turn uBeam into a way to connect Internet Of Things devices.
But what makes it so attractive to consumers will be that devices can charge at a distance of around 15 feet (though that could improve), even while a device is moving. That means you could carry your phone around and use it in a room outfitted with transmitters, and see your battery percentage grow.

Death To Cords
Wireless charging cases could free people from hunching by electrical outlets and rationing their energy all day. While smartphones have gotten progressively more slim and powerful, battery life has struggled to keep up. That’s not only a drain on satisfaction with smartphones, it stifles the entire mobile economy as a lack of power keeps people from downloading apps, shopping, or using on-demand services. uBeam could provide economic stimulus along with the delight and convenience people will pay for.
uBeam CEO Meredith Perry [by Paul Mauer]Then there’s the tech giants. Smartphone manufacturers like Apple and Samsung are desperate to solve their charging problems, and find a way to differentiate themselves in a lucrative but crowded market. There could be natural acquisition interest in uBeam, especially since the company and Perry hold several wireless charging patents that could prove highly valuable.
uBeam just received approval on another important patent this month. It covers how uBeam’s transmitters and receivers can communicate about configurations and which devices the transmitters should prioritize. These giants might be willing to pay a premium to buy uBeam just to keep it out of their competitors’ phones.
But long-term, if uBeam’s wireless charging protocol reaches its full potential, it could be the death of the power cord. Not just for phones, but for an extraordinarily wide array of electronics. Anywhere you see a charging cord, just imagine uBeam’s technology inside the device instead.
To be clear, uBeam is still working on a hard science problem where unexpected setbacks can happen. There are plenty of reasons it might not be able to get as cheap, powerful, fast, and safe as Perry hopes. But if it does, uBeam could be one of the transformative technologies of our era. And that’s just the swing for the fences that investors dream of.

34,The Marijuana Industry And Its First Crossroads,https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/25/the-marijuana-industry-and-its-first-crossroads/,2015/04/25,"
Editor’s note: Alex Thiersch is a managing principal of Salveo Capital, a private equity firm dedicated to investing in and developing the legal marijuana industry.
Marijuana has come a long way in the United States since California launched its first-in-the-nation medical program 19 years ago. Today, 23 states and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis to some degree, and public perception of the plant is clearly shifting. Medical marijuana is being used in treatment of a variety of illnesses including several types of seizures, cancer and post-traumatic stress disorder.
New polls by Gallup, Beyond the Beltway, and General Social Survey all show that for the first time since its prohibition, a majority of Americans support legalization of the plant. Change is coming to the American cannabis industry, and it’s time to prepare for it in earnest.


Marijuana is now on the cusp of mainstream legitimacy, and established business interests are beginning to work with the initial trailblazers of the American cannabis market. Further, while technological innovation is revolutionizing everyindustry, breakthrough ideas in a market as young this one have the chance to become defining cornerstones. Early-to-market products and solutions are seeing widespread adoption in absence of entrenched industry leaders.
New technology firms are playing a major part in increasing the efficiency, transparency, and security of the legal cannabis market. MJ Freeway, BioTrack THC, and Agrisoft have all developed software to track the plant from seed-to-sale, protecting the integrity of the supply chain at every step. Additionally, I constantly see proposals from developers aiming to find new ways to connect grower to sellers and sellers to consumers.
Companies like Open Vape are establishing benchmarks on what it means to consume marijuana in the 21st century. The company saw the intersection of the increasing popularity of e-cigarettes and the legalization of marijuana, and acted swiftly to become one of the biggest names in the industry. The firm’s convenient, portable, oil-based vaporizer designs were among the first to market, enabling it to now boast roughly 270,000 units sold per month.
While new vape pen designs continue to be one of the most popular uses of applied technology, advances in things like grow lights and dosing machines have the potential to change the industry at a far deeper level.
Intelligent Light Source, for example, is aiming to change the quality and quantity standards for all indoor grow industries through developing LED light systems that mimic the exact needs of particular plant species. The company launched recently trying to shift the paradigm away from simple light intensity toward shifting spectrums and pulses matching the plants’ natural growing cycles. This, the company says, increases not only the size of the yield, but also the quality of the final product while using less energy.
Change is coming to the American cannabis industry, and it’s time to prepare for it in earnest.
The individuals at the forefront of marijuana today are as American a success story as exists, seizing opportunity and creating success through ingenuity and determination, without a national infrastructure, and without the support services that businesses today take for granted. We are reaching a moment, however, where will and energy are not enough.
We like to talk about the spectacular development of the last few years as a “green rush,” but what we’ve experienced up to this point is merely a sign of what’s to come. When we achieve real mainstream acceptance — including comprehensive federal regulation of medical and adult use — we will see astronomical growth if we are prepared, and have developed the resources to fully take advantage of it.
Startups are stepping up to fill the structural gap, but the plant’s long legal prohibition has left a lot of holes to fill, and in these early stages there is still a long way to go before a solid backbone of services is in place.
New Frontier Financials, for example, seeks to harness the power of big data and apply it to the marijuana industry by capturing market trends and user demographics to generate sophisticated analytical models. Every major industry in the world has leveraged this kind of data as a predictive tool for cost-effective decisions. The cannabis industry is behind in that it is only building these tools now, but this sort of analysis has the chance to become part of the foundation of the business nationwide.
The vast majority of proposals that cross my desk are from people with decades of business experience pairing their exhaustive backgrounds with the new approaches of budding entrepreneurs. They work in a variety of more traditional fields — from finance to marketing, from real estate to manufacturing, and from pharmacy to commercial farming.
Dispensaries and cultivation centers are sexy investments right now – and of course we are committed to supporting legal growers and sellers in the United States. However, it will also take development of standardized packaging, voluntary product testing, and sophisticated marketing to build a mature, long-lasting, robust industry.
The introduction of bipartisan bills by high-profile politicians in the House and Senate to legalize medical marijuana is evidence that the national conversation is beginning to see legal cannabis as serious business. We must see ourselves that way as well. It’s very likely that half the country will have medical marijuana laws on the books by the end of 2016, and 18 of those states will have likely moved from medical-only to fully regulated adult use by 2020.
As the marketplace grows and acceptance increases, the consumer base will grow far beyond its current scope. National brands will develop, directed to a wide array of consumers from doctors to lawyers to soccer moms. The adult use market will have to diversify, appealing to as many different palettes and lifestyles as beer, wine and spirit companies do today.
From a medical standpoint we cannot refer to strains like “Sour Diesel” or “Jack the Ripper” as migraine medication or “Blue Crack” and “Crazy Miss Hyde” as a treatment for arthritis. A cancer patient should not walk into a dispensary and order “Ghost Train Haze” to relieve nausea related to chemotherapy.
As more research into the plant is done, it will result in a deeper understanding of how and why marijuana is used as an effective treatment for a variety of serious illnesses in many parts of the country. As the chemicals in the plant are isolated, and their interactions with the human body are charted, new strains will emerge to allay an even wider range of maladies. These targeted, refined strains will be developed as medicine, and will be labeled as such.

President Obama announced this morning that Jason Goldman, a longtime tech industry executive best known for his work alongside Ev Williams during the formative years of products such as Blogger, Twitter, and Medium, has been named the White House’s first-ever “Chief Digital Officer.” The news was first reported by Politico.
Goldman will be overseeing the White House’s digital outreach and leading its Office of Digital Strategy, expanding upon the duties previously spearheaded by erstwhile Obama aide Dan Pfeiffer. “Goldman brings new energy and coveted expertise as someone who’s helped shape the digital age,” Obama said in a quote to Politico.
He is the latest in a string of tech industry stars to join the public policy field in recent months: Former Google exec Megan Smith was tapped to serve as the White House’s CTO this past fall, and last week senior Facebook engineer David Recordon joined the White House to serve as its director of IT.

36,Dyson Invests $15M In Michigan Battery Tech Firm Sakti3,https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/16/dyson-invests-15m-in-michigan-battery-tech-firm-sakti3/,2015/03/16,"
Batteries are often still the main limiting factor when it comes to most electronic devices we use every day, and that includes electric vehicles. That’s why Dyson has invested $15 million into Sakti3, a Michigan-based firm that is developing a solid state battery tech that theoretically has much higher energy density (power per inch, essentially) than the current, liquid-based Lithium ion tech used in smartphones, notebooks, and (relevance alarm) Dyson’s handheld cordless vacuums.
Batteries continue to be among the wonder technologies most resistant to change, as the liquid Li-ion tech used in today’s gadgets was essentially pioneered back in 1991 by Sony, as a means of achieving higher energy densities vs. nickel cadmium rechargeables.
Sakti3’s tech is based on University of Michigan tech, and switches to a solid-state format, similar in many ways to the kind of solid state storage tech used for SSD computer drives. Instead of liquid Li-ion, Sakti3’s batteries use solid lithium electrodes, which makes it much better at storing more energy in smaller spaces, and at doing so in a safer manner, with a cheap and easy manufacturing method.

Dyson’s interest, as noted above, could definitely be around its handheld vacuums, which currently max out at around 20 minutes of unplugged power. But Sakti3’s research could have much further-ranging implications, for industries including smartphone sand PCs, as well as for vehicles. Dyson founder and CEO James Dyson has denied plans for any Dyson car in the future, but it often draws comparisons between its vacuum motors and vehicle powerhouses.
What’s good for the goose is good for the gander, as they say, and better batteries will serve anyone making electronics, so regardless of Dyson’s intentions for its new strategic partner, this is an exciting investment and a company to watch if you’ve ever hoped your smartphone could last longer than a day or two on a single charge.

37,Nest Touts Three Studies Claiming Its Thermostat Pays For Itself In Two Years,https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/02/nest-touts-three-studies-claiming-its-thermostat-pays-for-itself-in-two-years/,2015/02/02,"
Google-subsidiary Nest claims that the results of three studies based on longitudinal data show that its thermostat pays for itself in less than two years from savings from heating and cooling costs.
The studies were funded and implemented separately by the Energy Trust of Oregon, Indiana-based utility Vectren, and Nest itself. Averaged together, they claim that the Nest thermostat’s automatic temperature management reduces heating costs by 10-12 percent, and cooling costs by 15 percent.
Bill Bixby, Nest’s General Manager of Energy Services, says that “if you factor the average American’s utility bills into the equation, that means savings of $131-145 per year.” At $249 for a Nest Thermostat, that means you make up for the initial investment in less than two years.
Together, these three studies confirm what has long been a marketing bullet point for Nest: the idea that by cutting off the AC when you leave for work during the summer or turn on the heat while you drive home, it can cut your energy bills while keeping you comfortable. On its site, Nest claims “A correctly programmed thermostat can save about 20% on your heating and cooling bill,” which it says translates to $173 in savings.
Bixby says there are further opportunities for Nest to reduce people’s power usage. For one thing, as the company’s thermostats gather more usage data, the algorithms that decide how to adjust settings get better at responding to changes in temperature and anticipating future usage. With MyEnergy, Nest users can also look at the data from their power bills in a more understandable way and challenge friends to use less power.
As more companies partner up to make appliances around Nest APIs as part of the Works With Nest program, there will be more data for the company to draw from as each sensor gives the system a better idea of whether you’re home and if not, how long it will be until you get back. Just this month, Nest updated its APIs to allow appliance makers to show a product’s electricity, water, and gas use in the monthly Nest Energy Report so users can easily get a better idea of how their entire household affects the utility bill.

38,AuroraTek Tried To Pitch Us A Gadget That Breaks The Laws Of Physics At CES,https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/08/auroratek-tried-to-pitch-us-a-gadget-that-breaks-the-laws-of-physics-at-ces/,2015/01/08," 



As we covered the startup-heavy Eureka Park at The Sands for our coverage of CES, one booth stood out to my colleague Darrell Etherington and myself. On top of a table rested a few electric scooters, and behind them was a sign that read “The MOST Advanced Technology on Planet Earth!”
We both kind of figured that it was a gag to get attention for really nice electric scooters, so I went over to have a chat with the guy running the booth: William Alek, President and CEO of AuroraTek. I was live on-camera, so you get to see exactly how our interaction went down in the video above.
While AuroraTek is indeed working on electric scooters, Alek told me that the real star of the booth was a very special electrical transformer that could output more power than you put in it.
“Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding,” went my bullshit-o-meter. That goes against the first law of thermodynamics, a fundamental rule in physics that’s taught to students in elementary school: basically, energy cannot be created or destroyed.
I tried to give Alek the benefit of the doubt since we were on live video and let him explain himself. He gave me some pseudoscience claptrap about quantum tunneling and couldn’t put the effect he described in layman’s terms when I asked him to. AuroraTek’s homepage has an even better quote: “We call this NEGATIVE-to-POSITIVE Energy transformation FREE Energy or Overunity Technology because it has the appearance of Nothing Is Something.”
A sign at AuroraTek’s booth.
If I think a startup’s idea is dumb, I generally skip it and move on rather than lie or hate on something that a whole lot of people with different needs might find really useful. But selling the technological equivalent of snake oil? That, I cannot abide.
Part of me hopes that Alek is just a very dedicated troll.

39,AirEnergy Is An Upgradable Wind Turbine You Can Keep In A Backpack,https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/14/airenergy-is-an-upgradable-wind-turbine-you-can-keep-in-a-backpack/,2014/08/14,"
Have you ever wanted to become a self-sufficient hermit, living off the grid and generating all your own energy? Well you can stop drying out and burning your number-twos because here comes AirEnergy 3D.
This Polish crowdfunding project is a compact, portable, and upgradable wind turbine that consists of blades and a base station. Created by the folks at Omni3D, a 3D printer manufacturer, they’ve designed the platform to be modifiable and open source. You can even add new turbine blades by printing them on your standard 3D printer.
“From the very beginning the most important thing for us as 3D printers producer was educating people about the incredible potential of the technology. That’s why we always have special projects running inside Omni3D. We’ve printed prosthetic beak for a penguin that lost it in a fight, we are organizing free and open meetings where we explain the technology to young and old etc. This time the idea was to print something that can deliver more value than the printer itself. Another reason was the need for fully open source solutions in the renewable energy market,” said Konrad Sierzputowski, co-founder of Omni3D.
The kit costs about $350 on Kickstarter although they will open source the plans to allow anyone to build their own turbines. More importantly, they expect to send one assembled kit to a town in need for every £2,500 raised.
The turbine can, in ideal conditions, generate and store 300W of power. This means you can plug in a phone in a laptop or stick the generator into a wall socket and send electricity back onto the grid. While I doubt many of us want to set up a turbine in our back yards, I could see this as a nice, portable system for off-the-grid generation.
Will they mass-produce this product? Sierzputowski isn’t sure: he’s just trying to give something cool back to the 3D printing community. “The Kickstarter campaign will simply make it possible for us to prepare the project and give it back to the community,” he said. “All You need…is wind.”

40,Ambri Raises $35 Million For A New Approach To Grid-Scale Power Storage,https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/30/ambri-raises-35-million-for-a-new-approach-to-grid-scale-power-storage/,2014/04/30,"
The use of renewable energy is growing in the U.S., but its adoption has put pressure on old, overtaxed power grids. The intermittency of wind and solar power means that transmission systems need to find a way to store the energy generated from renewables to provide predictable power for grid operators.
The latest company to try its hand at solving the problem for utilities is Ambri, which just raised $35 million in new capital from new investors KLP Enterprises, the family office of Karen Pritzker and Michael Vlock, and the Swiss insurance company Building Insurance Bern. Previous investors Khosla Ventures, Bill Gates, and the energy company Total also participated in the financing.
Cambridge, Mass.-based Ambri is wading into some treacherous waters. Bankruptcies at Xtreme Power and A123 Energy show that building batteries for the grid can be a tricky business.
Despite the risk, investors remain undeterred. Ambri’s financing follows on the heels of a big $55 million investment by Bill Gates and others into Aquion Energy , which is also tackling the problem of large-scale energy storage.
With its latest financing, Ambri will deliver its first commercial systems to customers, build its initial commercial scale manufacturing plant, and continue technology development. The company has agreements in place to build prototype storage systems in Massachusetts, Hawaii, New York and Alaska, alongside project partners that include First Wind, Hawaiian Electric, Joint Base Cape Cod, Con Edison, Energy Excelerator (Hawaii) and Raytheon, the company says.
Previously known as the Liquid Metal Battery Corporation, Ambri is developing its battery technology from research conducted by Dr. Donald Sadoway, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, alongside Dr. David Bradwell — Ambri’s chief technology officer and co-founder. Since its launch in 2012 the company has raised over $50 million and holds the only license for the liquid metal battery technology developed by MIT.
MIT has long-dominated The research on campus has been supported by the US Department of Energy’s ARPA-E program, Total, the Deshpande Center, and the Chesonis Family Foundation. Ambri has also received grants from the Office of Naval Research and the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center.
“Ambri’s solution is highly distinguished from others in the marketplace on cost and performance –- thanks to a simple manufacturing process, use of cheap and safe materials, and significantly longer lifetime compared to other approaches we’ve seen,” says Andrew Chung, a partner at Khosla Ventures and director on the Ambri board, in a statement.
Despite the lean times and bad press that the cleantech industry has faced, Khosla has remained consistent in its investment thesis around the promise of renewable energy and energy-efficiency technologies.
It is by far the sector that has raised the most money in the Khosla portfolio, according to data from CrunchBase.

The White House needs a few good data scientists to help its climate change campaign. Instead of creating all of the doomsday scenarios itself, the White House is opening up government data so that researchers can create their own simulations and also help the cities prepare for the impacts.
“The Obama Administration is today issuing a call to America’s top private-sector innovators to leverage open government data resources and other datasets to build tools that will make America’s communities more resilient to climate change and to forge cross-sector partnerships to make those tools as useful as possible,” explains a White House fact sheet on the website.
Data on everything from coastal flooding to tsunami activity has been put in a developer-friendly new web portal on Data.gov. To incentivize work on this somewhat obscure topic, it’s paired the new data with a host of prize-based competitions, including the “Coastal Flooding Innovation Challenge,” to “help people understand their exposure to coastal hazards and their increased vulnerability due to population increase and sea level rise.”
The move is a continuation of the open-data-happy policies of Chief Technology Officer Todd Park, who explained his approach to me back in 2012:
We are enabling entrepreneurs and innovators across all walks of life to tap into fields of data sitting in the vaults of government in machine-readable form. They can, as they did with weather data, as they did with GPS data, create all kinds of services and products that we can only even barely imagine.

42,Primus Power Gets A $20M Jolt For Grid-Scale Energy Storage,https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/04/primus-power-gets-a-20m-jolt-for-grid-scale-energy-storage/,2014/02/04,"
New regulations in California are set to open up the market for large-scale energy storage and battery technology developer Primus Power has just raised charge into the fray. The Hayward, Calif.-based battery startup has raised $20 million for a new round from strategic investor Anglo American Platinum through its Platinum Group Metals Development Fund.
Previous investors Chrysalix Energy Venture Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, I2BF, and DBL Investors have committed another $15 million to the company over two previous rounds of funding.
Primus’ new investment comes as other battery companies tackling large-scale energy storage for utilities have stumbled. Xtreme Power, a Lyle, Texas-based company raised $48.5 million from venture investors before declaring bankruptcy earlier this year. A123 Systems, which was also attempting to develop grid-scale energy storage technologies in addition to manufacturing lithium-ion batteries for cars and power tools, was bought out of bankruptcy by the Chinese manufacturer Wanxiang Group in January 2013.
For South Africa-based resource developer, Anglo American Platinum, the investment in Primus is an attempt to juice consumption of its platinum ores – almost like an Intel investment in computers and software to drive chip consumption. The fund is also an investor in Canadian fuel cell manufacturer Ballard Power.
In addition to its venture capital commitments, Primus has also raised $20 million in government grants to tackle the grid-scale energy storage problem. These problems are caused by the intermittence of renewable energy coming online. Solar and wind power are not constant and grid scale storage is one way to ensure that power generated by these alternative energy sources is not wasted.
Globally the market for grid storage is expected to grow more than 30% over the next six years, according to a study by Navigant consulting cited by Primus Power. By 2020 the consulting firm expects the market for big batteries to reach the big sticker price of $21.9 billion. California, with its mandate for 1.3 gigawatts of energy storage coming online by 2020 is leading the charge.
Big markets like this bring out big competitors and massive industrial conglomerates like General Electric, the Japanese company NGK Insulators, and smaller companies like ZBB Energy are all developing new large-scale energy storage products.
What differentiates Primus from other batteries is its design. Unlike other flow batteries Primus’ batteries don’t have a membrane. The company uses a metal electrode which has twice the cost but can handle ten times the power density of other batteries, according to Tom Stepien, Primus Power’s chief executive officer.
“Our [batteries] can handle ten times the density, even at twice the cost we win on a factor of five,” he said. “The [other] difference is we have a single flow loop – other batteries have two tanks, two sets of pipes and two sets of pumps – the single flow leads us to a lower cost.”
Primus already will be shipping its first energy storage systems to a military base in Southern California later this year and is installing another set of energy storage devices at an existing sub-station run by Puget Sound Energy outside of Seattle.
For Kleiner Perkins the investment in Primus Power represents the firm’s third battery deal in two months. Battery companies in Kleiner’s portfolio including Aquion Energy and Amprius have raised a cool $100 million since January.
“There were a few rough years in cleantech,” said Nancy Pfund of DBL Investors – a backer of cleantech darlings Tesla Motors and SolarCity. “When you weed out the poor players there’s a huge opportunity that remains and we think the industry is just getting started.”

43,"Google Makes $200M Equity Investment In Texas Wind Farm, Says Its Investments Now Generate 2 Gigawatts",https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/09/google-makes-200m-equity-investment-in-texas-wind-farm/,2013/01/09,"
Google just announced yet another major investment in renewable energy. The company says that it has made a $200 million equity investment in an existing wind farm in Oldham County Texas. The Spinning Spur Wind Farm currently produces about 161 MW and uses 70 Siemens turbines to generate enough power for about 60,000 U.S. homes. EDF Renewable Energy, the current owner of the project, will manage the project and will remain the owner alongside Google.
This is one of Google’s largest investments in renewable energy yet, though it’s trumped by the $280 million the company put into the SolarCity fund in 2011.
EDF itself purchased the wind farm last January from Austin-based Cielo Wind Power for $322 million and finished the project by the end of 2012 in order to qualify for a number of federal incentives that were set to expire on December 31.
As for the company’s reason for today’s investment, Kojo Ako-Asare, Senior Manager, Corporate Finance at Google writes that the company looks “for projects like Spinning Spur because, in addition to creating more renewable energy and strengthening the local economy, they also make for smart investments: they offer attractive returns relative to the risks and allow us to invest in a broad range of assets.”
“EDF Renewable Energy is pleased to engage with an innovative company like Google on this equity financing,” said Jim Peters, Vice President of Project Finance in a statement today. “The partnership between our companies reflects a departure from sourcing investment capital from traditional financial institutions for our renewable energy projects. This transaction provides an opportunity for a leading renewable energy developer to join forces with a leading technology company to create value for both our companies and our respective customers.”
In total, the eleven renewable energy projects Google has invested in are now capable of generating over 2 gigawatts of power, the company says, enough to power about half a million U.S. homes. Google also stressed that four of its projects hit a number of important milestones in the last year. Here is the company’s summary of those:


The Atlantic Wind Connection received permission to begin permitting, an important step in advancing the construction of the United States’ first offshore backbone electric transmission system (more in this new video).

Shepherds Flat, one of the world’s largest wind farms with a capacity of 845 MW, became fully operational in October.
The Ivanpah project, which is more than 75 percent complete and employs 2,000+ people, recently installed its 100,000th heliostat, a kind of mirror (more in this new video).

Just yesterday (PDF), the fourth and final phase of Recurrent Energy’s 88MW solar installation in Sacramento County, Calif., reached commercial operation.

44,White House Pushes Green Button To Liberate Your Energy Data,https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/05/green-button/,2012/02/05,"
The future of easy home energy monitoring may be a little bit closer, thanks to a government initiative designed to allow consumers direct access to their energy consumption data.
The White House’s new Green Button gives utilities a way to simplify and standardize sharing usage statistics with their customers via a one-click download. Two California providers, Pacific Gas & Electric and San Diego Gas & Electric, already launched the feature, adding what is literally a green button to their websites. Utility companies in other regions are expected to implement it within the next year. Customers can click the button to download their personal usage information in one place. 
The interesting aspect isn’t so much in the download itself, but what can be done with it. Federal officials hope this kind of data liberation will inspire developers to build apps and services that will help customers track and reduce their energy consumption. One study showed that subjects who were given access to their data reduced their usage by 8.7% just by tracking it. At scale, this could mean an annual savings of $32 billon per year on the country’s annual $369 billion power bill.  
The Green Button was inspired by the government’s success with its Blue Button initiative, which allows veterans instant access to their health care data.

45,Marine Solar Cells Make The Most Of Sun And Waves,https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/03/marine-solar-cells/,2012/01/03,"
In an unusual hybrid, British industrial designer Phil Pauley created Marine Solar Cells that harness energy from both the sun and water. 

The web of energy generators capture energy off-shore, using a combination of floating photovoltaics and natural buoyancy displacement. Thanks to the reflective nature of water, the solar component’s efficiency is up to 20% greater than it would be land-locked. 

The devices can be made using recycled materials and, by attaching the units to underwater mooring, can be placed nearly anywhere off-shore, creating subsea batteries or power plants. 

The technology is currently in concept stage, so you won’t need to dodge them on your next water sport adventure, but it does have the potential to be a substantial source of new energy, especially if installed in turbulent high sea areas.

46,"Facebook, NRDC & Opower To Partner On Energy-Saving Social App",https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/17/facebook-nrdc-opower-to-partner-on-energy-saving-social-app/,2011/10/17,"
Facebook, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and clean tech startup Opower are today announcing a partnership on a new social networking-based energy application that will help consumers monitor, improve and compare their home’s energy usage with their friends and other Facebook users.
The app, designed to improve energy awareness, has the potential to combine the 800 million+ users on Facebook with Opower’s network of over 60 utility partners reaching 55 million U.S. households. However, the social app will start off with just a few participating utilities when it launches in early 2012.
Opower, a software-as-a-service company, currently helps electric and gas utilities understand their customers and how they’re using power. Home owners use Opower’s online applications to gain insights into their usage patterns, set personal goals to reduce consumption and even receive alerts if they’re headed towards a big electric bill at the end of the month. The proactive alerts give customers a chance to reduce consumption before it’s too late.
Now, the new Facebook application will bring some of these same features to the social networking service. Participating users will be able to automatically pull in data from their utility provider in order to benchmark their home’s energy usage against a national average of similar homes, compare their energy use with their Facebook friends, enter energy-saving competitions and share tips on how to become more energy efficient. In addition, users will be able to share their energy use, ranking and group participation to their Facebook News Feed.
The NRDC’s involvement will be to provide additional environmental expertise while also seeking out new partners and encouraging consumer participation.
Commonwealth Edison (ComEd), the City of Palo Alto (Calif.) and Glendale Water & Power (GWP) will be the first U.S. utilities to offer their customers the ability to import usage data into the social energy application. Combined, these utilities offer access to 4 million customers, including all of Chicago’s residents.
The NRDC states that improvements to energy efficiency has the ability to generate $700 billion in cost savings in the U.S. alone, but consumer participation is key to making that change happen. The organization is no stranger to the use of word-of-mouth techniques in this area, going all the way back to its Hood River Conservation Project in the 80’s which, at the time, leveraged real-life social networks to spread word of an energy improvement program. Now it hopes to use word-of-mouth on Facebook’s online network to enact similar behavioral change.
The organizations will formally announce the partnership later this afternoon. More information will be posted to Facebook’s “Green on Facebook” page.

To accomplish this, Simple Energy is running an energy saver contest that offers a social gaming experience with real-world rewards.
The contest is in collaboration with the White House’s recent smart grid announcement, which detailed a number of new initiatives meant to accelerate the modernization of the U.S.’s electric grid through the use of smart grid technologies.
In the case of the Simple Energy contest called “Biggest Energy Saver,” the idea is to make energy saving a fun game where customers compete against their neighbors to waste less, and subsequently lower their electric bills.
Using data from the home’s smart meter, SDG&E will measure year-over-year energy consumption (kWh) of the participants for three months. Customers can “compete” by making changes to their home, like weatherizing doors and windows, sealing air leaks, adjusting thermostats, switching to energy-saving lightbulbs and more.

Participants are also encouraged to visit www.biggestenergysaver.com, where they can join with others in an online community to talk about smart meters and how to use smart technology to reduce their electricity consumption, control their electric costs, and help the environment.
The contest is sponsored by GRID 21, a new non-profit organization committed to engaging electricity customers in reducing consumption. During the course of the 3-month challenge, daily top savers are entered into drawings for $25 gift certificates to local stores, monthly savers can win an iPad 2 and the “Biggest Energy Saver” of them all wins a gaming laptop worth $1,500.
It does seem to be a bit odd that the energy saving contest awards energy-gobbling gadgets as prizes instead of something like discounts on new insulation or weather strips, for example. However, those awards clearly reflect the desire of today’s electricity-using households to fill their homes with more and more devices, which, in aggregate, help put a strain on the grid.
Teaching the early adopters of smart meters, who are also likely to be the gadget-obsessed top power consumers, how to better save energy may not be such a bad idea.

48,EnergyHub Launches Energy Management System For Consumers,https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/30/energyhub-launches-energy-management-system-for-consumers/,2011/08/30,"
Today, EnergyHub launched its new, comprehensive, in-home energy management system for U.S. consumers. The system includes the EnergyHub Home Base, for centralized management of the electricity usage in the home, as well as The EnergyHub Thermostat, Sockets and Strips.
The Home Base also connects to the Web via Wi-Fi, allowing users to remotely manage individual components via Web-based or mobile applications that run on iOS and Android devices.
The new system is notable not only for its ease-of-use – just plug in your devices, and you’re ready to go – but also because it’s now available outside of a utility-sponsored program.
Previously, the company sold its hardware to utility providers, who then installed the devices in customers’ home. Today’s launch of a direct-to-consumer offering democratizes access to these same energy monitoring systems and tools.

The EnergyHub Home Base is the central station for interacting with the home’s connected devices, where it displays your current and projected energy use on its colorful touchscreen. Here, data is tracked in real-time, and you can program various usage parameters in order to control energy usage automatically.
There are also modes called “At Home,” “Goodnight,” and “Away” that let you program various configurations that can be enabled with just one touch.
The system’s Wireless Thermostat lets you track and manage your home’s heating and cooling systems, while EnergyHub Sockets, Strips and Heavy Duty Controllers let you monitor individual appliances.
The Home Base comes in two versions: ZigBee and ERT-compatible, which refers to two common radio types used by smart meters. (This video helps explain which one is right for you).
And when you’re away from home, the EnergyHub Web-based and mobile apps help you switch between the various modes and remotely control appliances.

EnergyHub pricing is as follows:

Home Base + Thermostat  – ZigBee version: $299.99 / ERT version $389.99
Starter Kit (Home Base + Socket + Strip) – ZigBee version $324.99 / ERT version $414.99
Starter Kit + Thermostat – ZigBee version $399.99 / ERT version $499.99
Sockets, Strips, and Thermostats are also available individually for $39.99, $89.99, and $99.99, respectively

EnergyHub raised $14.5 million in a Series B round last week, as two new investors, Acadia Woods and the New York City Investment Fund, joined existing investors .406 Ventures and Physic Ventures. The funds will be used to support commercial deployments and the launch of the new Mercury wireless thermostat software service.

49,Harvesting Energy From Radio Signals: Two New Devices From Japan (Video),https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/03/harvesting-energy-from-radio-signals-two-new-devices-from-japan-video/,2011/08/03,"
Gleaning electricity from radio signals isn’t super-efficient (or a new concept), but it’s possible technically. Two companies from Japan have recently come up with new devices that can do just that: one is harvesting energy from cell phone signals, the other uses a rectifying antenna (Rectenna) to produce energy.
First, a device [JP] recently announced by Tokyo Electron Device can pick up radio signals from cell phones in the 800MHz band and convert them into electricity (800MHz is the frequency used in handsets in Japan). The company says that users can expect to get up to 2.5 milliamperes of charge (stored in a small lithium-ion battery).
The device collects signals from other wireless gadgets, too, and it can provide a few more minutes of run time when built into tablets and notebooks (which is better than nothing). Tokyo Electron markets it as “green” product and cooperated with US company Powercast in its development.
We don’t have media for that device but a professional video shot of the next one, a newly developed Rectenna coming from Tokyo-based Nihon Dengyo Kosaku. The device (pictured above) itself has two main selling points: it’s thin (12mm for collecting Wi-Fi signals and 30mm for digital terrestrial broadcast waves) and needs just 50µW of power to start.
Nihon Dengyo says that their rectenna can glean power in the micro-watt range from Wi-Fi signals at a distance of around 10cm, enough to power sensors, for example. The device can be used both inside and outside of buildings.
Here’s a video (shot by Diginfonews in Tokyo, in English) that provides more insight:

50,DIY Energy Monitor Mounts To Your Electric Meter,https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/13/diy-energy-monitor-mounts-to-your-electric-meter/,2011/05/13,"Remote electricity meters are interesting things. They essentially change the way you think about the juice flowing into your home by connecting to the potentially aged box in your basement and sensing the total energy usage in your home over time. The resulting stats are often quite enlightening and may help you make wiser energy-use decisions.
This DIY solution uses a small breakout box with an IR sensor that senses an IR light that flashes when you’ve used a kilowatt hour of electricity. You could also retrofit this to work with older boxes using a light that is interrupted as the disk inside the meter spins. The sensor can tell how often the beam is interrupted and transmit that data to a computer or other device.
the box holds some minimal electronics (14 pin AVR micro, a resistor, a capacitor, and a phototransistor), the piece of rubber shades the meter, and the bungee cord holds it all together in a most attractive way. okay, i was kidding about the last part.

51,Panasonic Shows Advanced Fuel Cell For Home Use,https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/10/panasonic-shows-advanced-fuel-cell-for-home-use/,2011/02/10,"
IThe news has become muted regarding fuel cells and their future role in energy supply in recent years, but it seems we’re getting there step by step: Panasonic today said that it has developed a new type of home-use fuel cell [press release in English], which  is more efficient and cheaper than its existing solutions.
Created in cooperation with major Japanese energy company Tokyo Gas, Panasonic’s new Ene-Farm fuel cell boasts an energy conversion efficiency of 40%, which is the world’s highest (according to the companies involved in the development). Panasonic’s previous offering just reached an efficiency of 37%.

This new model features a power output of 250 to750W, and it and needs just 2sqm for installation, slashing the footprint of existing offerings by about 50%. It cuts primary energy consumption approximately 35% and CO2 emissions by around 48%.

Panasonic also says that the new Ene-Farm can help an average Japanese family reduce electricity bills by $600 to $725 per year. Partner Tokyo Gas will start selling the fuel cell in Japan on April for between $14,000 and $17,000 (after government subsidies), which is 30% cheaper than existing fuel cells.

Fujitsu today announced the development of a single device that’s capable of generating electricity from either heat or light. Previously, two devices had to be combined to generate electricity from these sources (through energy harvesting, energy can be derived from external sources like light, heat, vibrations, wind energy etc.).
On paper, Fujitsu’s so-called hybrid energy harvesting device doubles the energy-capture potential (see below).

The company also says its new device doesn’t require wiring or battery replacements, meaning it can serve as a rather inexpensive solution in areas with insufficient energy supply in the future.
What you can see on the picture on top of this post is a prototype device manufactured on flexible substrate. Fujitsu says it’s now working on improving their technology to commercialize it by around 2015.

53,"Even If Solar Grows 30X, It Will Only Be 4% Of America's Power Capacity",https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/25/even-if-solar-funding-vc-bloomberg-photovoltaic/,2010/10/25,"
For all the talk about solar, the US market for solar power still has a long way to go before it makes a real dent in the country’s overall power capacity.
On Monday morning, Bloomberg New Energy Finance, a major aggregator of green industry data released a few key projections: the US solar market is on track to grow 30x to 44 gigawatts by 2020 and could make up 4.3% of America’s total power capacity. Of this fraction, the bulk (or approximately 68%) will be in photovoltaics with solar thermal making up the remainder.  Furthermore, Bloomberg predicts that consumer traction will also move noticeably higher, with 2.4% of homes solar-equipped by 2020.
Of course, that path to 4.3% of national power capacity is not cheap. In order to get there, the US market will need to attract $100 billion in investment dollars.
The possible leap from 1.4GW to 44GW is an impressive growth curve, but these figures certainly highlight the simultaneous growth and challenge of solar installation.
As Bloomberg New Energy Finance points out, the surge in solar capacity has been supported by two crucial trends: the drop in prices (the price of photovoltaic modules has tumbled from roughly $300 per watt in the mid-20th century, to less than $5 per watt today) and the heavy hand of government support. And yet, even as solar becomes more affordable, it’s still playing catch up to other sources of energy. That may be a well known fact but it often gets muffled in the bucolic vision for solar panel farms as far as the eyes can see.
“The group’s latest analysis places the unsubsidized cost of best-in-class photovoltaic and solar thermal electrivity generation at just below $200/megawatt hour— nearly four times the equivalent cost for a coal-fired power plant ($56/megawatt hour)— and between two and four times the cost of onshore wind power, ” according to the Bloomberg report.
On the investment front, it will be interesting to see how the solar industry fares in the money race. Overall, the sector has been a major beacon for investment dollars but momentum has recently waned. According to a Mercom Capital report for the third quarer,  VC funding for the solar sector was $169.35 million on 11 deals, versus $922 million for 18 transactions in the prior quarter. On the flip side, there was strength in other funding sources (including credit lines from banks), which totaled a healthy $20.7 billion for the quarter.

Sanyo in Japan today announced [JP] what it says is the world’s first solar-cell-equipped public bus, the Solarve (which stands for Solar Vehicle). The bus was unveiled to commemorate the 100th anniversary of a Japanese transportation and logistics company called Ryobi [JP]. The Solarve is essentially a city bus with solar cells on top that generate power for its interior LED lights.
Sanyo says the solar panels atop the diesel-electric hybrid bus are good for a total output of 798 watts (420W through crystalline silicon cells, and the rest through amorphous silicon cells). When the sun isn’t shining for an extended period of time, power will be supplied by storage batteries inside the bus for about nine hours.
The Solarve is expected to be first used as early as September 1 (in Okayama City in Southern Japan).

55,Study Shows People Are Clueless About Energy Savings – Here's What Actually Works.,https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/18/study-shows-people-are-clueless-about-energy-savings-heres-what-actually-works/,2010/08/18,"Quick, name one of the best things you can do to save energy at home. If you said “turning off the lights,” you’d be wrong.  But you are not alone, most Americans say the same thing.  A new survey shows most people have misconceptions about what works best to save energy.
Keeping lights off isn’t a bad idea in itself, but it has significantly less impact than swapping out the bulbs for more energy-efficient ones, says Shahzeen Attari, who published a paper on the survey.
In some cases, leaving energy-efficient lights on may actually be more effective: according the the Department of Energy, the lifespan of compact fluorescents, or CFLs, is decreased by being frequently switched off and on. If you are leaving the room for less than 15 minutes, it is actually more efficient to keep a CFL on for that time. If you will be gone for more than 15 minutes, however, it is more efficient to switch the light off.
Survey participants were asked an open-ended question on what they thought was the single most effective thing they could do to conserve energy in their lives. Attari put the most common responses into two main categories: curtailment, meaning not doing something as often, and efficiency, meaning making their energy use itself less wasteful.
The majority of the participants’ answers, such as turning off lights, changing thermostat settings and unplugging appliances, fell into the curtailment category. These actions are certainly helpful, but even more effective are efficiency changes, such as using CFL light bulbs, buying Energy Star appliances, and driving a hybrid car. In other words, it’s better to buy new, efficient equipment than to sparingly use older, energy-hungry products.
This graph shows survey participants’ mean perceived energy usage or savings in watts per hour versus actual energy usage or savings. The dotted line represents perfect accuracy:
Perceptions were often inaccurate. For example, many thought central air conditioning uses only 1.3 times the energy of a single room AC unit, when it actually uses around 3.5 times as much energy.
Many consumers don’t have a good concept of how much energy per hour a given appliance uses. People understand how much energy goes into a light bulb per hour, Attari said, but not the equivalent of how many light bulbs per hour are used by a dishwasher.
Attari also attributed a psychological phenomenon called single action bias, in which a person does one or two things to address a problem and considers themselves off the hook, as an explanation of why some believe they do more to conserve energy than they really are. When those one or two things fall into curtailment, like turning off the lights, instead of efficiency, like replacing the washer, they help less than some perceive.
Psychology aside, if each of us were to do just one or two things to save energy, Attari recommends they be replacing light bulbs with CFL bulbs and weatherizing our homes. Generalized recommendations can be muddy, however, as each person’s energy usage is different. This means that for some, the most effective thing might be to use public transportation instead of driving, or to line-dry clothes after washing them.
In another report, Gerald T. Gardner and Paul C. Stern compiled a short list of the most effective things Americans can do to save energy. Using warm or cold water to wash clothes and installing or upgrading attic insulation are two of their suggestions. See the full list in the table below:

Here are five of the most effective things you can at home to lower your energy consumption:
1. Replace incandescent light bulbs with compact fluorescent (CFL) bulbs
2. Weatherize your home with caulk or weather-stripping (80% of older homes are under-insulated)
3. Install a more efficient heating and/or air conditioning unit
4. Install or upgrade attic insulation and ventilation
5. Adjust your washing machine settings to warm, or even cold, water

56,Alternative Energy: A Guide To Greening Your Home,https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/17/alternative-energy-a-guide-to-greening-your-home/,2010/08/17,"Alternative energy is a growing market, and though many states offer tax credits, rebates, and other incentives to promote clean energy, it can still prove to be an expensive proposition.
It generally also requires plugging your energy source into the grid so you’re not left in the dark when the wind calms or the sun lingers behind clouds.
Here is a roundup of solutions that can help power a home.
Solar
Solar is, in some ways, the easiest solution, or at least one of the most accessible. Plugging into the sun requires photovoltaic solar panels, an inverter, and batteries that can store a bit of any excess energy for a rainy day.
Performance varies regionally, of course, with states in the southern and southwestern regions enjoying the most days of sun per year.
Solar panels require little maintenance once installed and can provide large amounts of electricity in fair weather. It can be expensive, however, even with incentives, and even when hooked up to batteries, it doesn’t do much good when there’s no sun for stretches at a time.
Resources
GetSolar has a database for finding a solar installer in your area. It’s wise to compare quotes from several companies. Some installers prefer to install panels sold by their companies, while others will install any panels you purchase.
It’s also possible to rent solar panels. One of the largest renters is Citizenrē REnU, which offers 1, 5 or 25-year contracts that include installation.
Wind
Wind energy is often associated with mammoth wind farms, but smaller sized turbines are also produced for backyard energy production.
The speed of the wind is the determining factor in whether wind power is the right solution for your home. Weather services can tell you what the average wind speed in your region is, but it can vary within a region.
Not surprisingly, bigger turbines can produce larger amounts of energy. A 10-kilowatt turbine can usually provide enough energy for a house and is usually around 100 feet tall with a 23-foot turbine.
As with solar, wind energy is climate-dependent so when the turbine’s not turning, you might need a different energy source. Unlike solar, wind turbines have the added con of being built of out of moving parts that need regular maintenance.
Resources
A turbine large enough to power a home often requires a permit. The American Wind Energy Association offers a useful guide for going through the necessary steps to install your own turbine, as well as a list of wind gear providers.
If you’re low on space or looking for a plug-and-play solution, try a personal wind turbine like Southwest Windpower’s Air-X. It can produce up to 400 watts, enough to offset some lighting and appliance usage, and can be installed on top of a roof.
Alternatively, try Clarian’s Jellyfish When it hits the market next year, i will be able to provide the same potential wattage and also feature the ability to power your home by plugging into any standard wall outlet.
If you’re a do-it-yourselfer, find an old treadmill and take a stab at making your own as in this video:

Geothermal
Most geothermal energy is produced large scale, so single-home geothermal is usually limited to heating and cooling solutions. Still, considering how much energy indoor climate control can consume, geothermal heat pumps can significantly reduce your energy needs.
Geothermal heat pumps tap into the earth’s stable temperature to regulate that in your home. The pump moves heat from the earth to your home in winter and pulls the heat inside your house outside in summer.
Most pumps are built simply so they require little, if any maintenance, and  can be equipped with a household water heater as well.
Geothermal heat pumps are not a full-service solution, even for heating and cooling. Some models have been shown to reduce energy bills by up to 40%, which means you can’t say goodbye to your utility company and be completely comfortable indoors.
Cost is another concern. A heat pump with enough capacity to keep a home cozy averages just shy of $8,000, but the drilling required to install it can be upwards of $30,000.
Resources
Because of the amount and depth of drilling involved, geothermal heat pumps are not typically a do-it-yourself project. To find a reliable contractor, check the International Ground Source Heat Pump Association‘s directory of accredited installers to find one in your area.
Micro hydro electricity
This one only works if you live near moving water, but it can be very effective. Installation requires running a pipe from a high area where water is flowing to a lower piece of ground. Energy is produced as water moves downhill and turns a turbine at the end of the pipe.
Some micro hydro systems have been capable of producing ten or even 100 times more power than wind or solar. Unlike wind and solar, it can run non-stop and overnight, so long as the water continues to flow. An inverter and batteries can be connected to store extra energy if needed.
As with wind, the turbine requires maintenance and has the potential to break. Also, the size and pressure of the stream affects its energy production, so a very small stream might not be enough to power an entire house. Small streams also carry the risk of drying up in summer or freezing in cold weather.
Resources
You’ll probably need a contractor to install a micro hydro system. Many cities and states require anyone installing alternative energy sources to be a licensed electrician, especially if it connects to the grid. Although there isn’t a national licensing organization for micro hydro installers in the U.S., a local search should or call to your utility company should point you in the right direction.
Or, if you know what you’re doing and are as handy and patient as this guy, you can build your own micro hydro system.
Kössler, a joint venture between Siemens and Voith, makes several turbines designed for small power stations.
Energy Systems & Design also produces micro hydro equipment that can be used for a single home.
Fuel cells
Fuel cells use fuel and an oxidizing agent, typically hydrogen and oxygen, to produce heat and electricity. Inside the cell, he hydrogen’s ions and electrons are separated. An electrolyte substance inside the cell lets ions pass through but blocks electrons, which travel through a wire instead, in the form of electricity. The remaining ions turn into water or carbon dioxide when they meet with oxygen.
Resources
Bloom Energy‘s relatively new Bloom Box, which we reported on earlier this year, might be one of the most talked about home fuel cell solutions, though with its current price tag of $700,000-$800,000, it’s not exactly cheap.
Acumentrics manufactures fuel cells primarily for military use, but can also supply you with one for your home.
Most fuel cell companies don’t sell directly to the public, so you’ll have to search for an installer. FuelCellToday‘s directory can help you find one in your area.
The Department of Energy is working on developing best practices for safe hydrogen handling.
Biomass
Biomass for the home usually comes in the form of a stove used either for general home heating, or to heat water. Stoves are usually fueled by plants, including crops, trees, wood waste or grass. Biomass stoves do pollute the air, but many still consider them green because they contribute less pollution with fewer harmful chemicals than fossil fuels.
Resources
Those looking to buy a biofuel stove might try Bixby‘s MaxFire, which can be fueled with dry-shelled corn or wood pellets.
Bixby claims the stove can reduce heating costs by up to 50% and keep a typical home warm for about $1.50 per day. The stove ignites immediately with the push of a button and has eight heat level settings. When fuel is burned, the stove automatically pushes ash into a drawer that can be emptied without too much of a mess.
None of these solutions provide a fail-safe way to meet all your energy needs, but with blackouts from overburdened grids and severe weather conditions, neither do utility companies. It can be argued that some of these solutions are not entirely green, but even if they can’t completely alleviate the need for fossil fuels, they can help reduce the amount we need.
Most states offer incentives for alternative energy investments, and the Department of Energy suggests additional ways to lower usage and costs and lists products that are currently eligible for federal tax credits.
Despite state incentives, installing alternative energy is still an expensive proposition for most, but it can pay off in the long run.

57,"The Heat Is On: There Is Plenty Of Geothermal Energy Underground, We Just Need To Get To It",https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/05/the-heat-is-on-there-is-plenty-of-geothermal-energy-underground-we-just-need-to-get-to-it/,2010/08/05,"Most green technologies gather energy above ground, but like Jules Verne, we want to take you on A Journey to the Center of the Earth. Alright, not even close to the center, but deep down nonetheless, where naturally occurring hot water can be turned into clean energy above ground.
It is estimated that the amount of heat within 30,000 feet below the earth’s surface holds potentially 50,000 times more energy than all global oil and natural gas resources combined.  According to the Geothermal Energy Association, up to 6,400 megawatts of new capacity could be created from the geothermal projects under development in the U.S. But getting to that energy is proving to be a challenge.
Geothermal energy comes in a variety of forms, from residential fixtures to power a single home, to commercial plants that can power a city. Energy is usually harnessed from hot underground water or steam that naturally rises to the surface. Power plants drill holes into the rock to gain more direct access and use the hot water and steam to drive electric generators. After its use, the water can be pumped back underground to heat up anew. Power plants use different energy harnessing designs based on the type and temperature of the geothermal resource available.
Geothermal deals are heating up as it begins to prove itself as a viable energy source.  For instance, Ormat Technologies recently bought Constellation Energy’s 50% share of the Mammoth Geothermal Plant in California for $72.5 million. The deal gives Ormat three power plants capable of generating 29 megawatts of power and rights to more than 10,000 acres of undeveloped federal lands.
Ormat’s home state of Nevada is a geothermal powerhouse. According to the Geothermal Energy Association, the state produces more geothermal energy than all but eight nations. Its geothermal capacity jumped from 200 to 400 megawatts during the last five years, and as many as 3,000 more megawatts are expected to be generated from developing projects. A typical coal-fired power plant can generate about 500 megawatts, though some are much larger. Nuclear power plants typically range from a 500 to 2000 megawatt capacity.
Unlike wind and solar, whose energy outputs fluctuate based on weather conditions, geothermal provides consistent base load electricity, which is the minimum amount a power utility’s customers need. It is also considered clean because it produces no greenhouse gas pollution, and renewable because the water can be reused. Last year, Obama gave $350 million in Recovery Act funding for geothermal projects.
Most geothermal plants have been located near the edges of tectonic plates, where there is a lot of geothermal activity, but companies like AltaRock Energy, which has received funding from Google, among others, are developing ways to generate steam in other geographic areas. The technology, known as Enhanced Geothermal Systems, drills into hot rocks miles below the surface and pumps cold water down to them to generate steam. The technology has been in development for a while, though there have been concerns that EGS might trigger seismic activity that could lead to earthquakes.
It’s been a very rocky road, to say the least. Last year, AltaRock abandoned its trials near a plant called The Geysers in northern California when instabilities in the rock caused the borehole to collapse. The company moved its tests to Oregon where it is working on a three-year EGS demo near Newberry National Volcanic National Monument. AltaRock’s competitor, Ram Power Corporation, purchased The Geysers in June. If the AltaRock’s Oregon demo is successful, a power generator will be placed next to the wells to test how much energy can be harnessed from them.

58,Caltech Awarded $122 Million to Create Fuel From Sunlight,https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/22/doe-funding-artificial-photosynthesis-to-create-clean-fuel/,2010/07/22,"The U.S. Department of Energy announced today that it will award up to $122 million to create a Fuels form Sunlight Energy Innovation Hub led by the California Institute of Technology. The Hub’s goal is to develop ways to convert solar energy into chemical fuels and scale the technology for commercial use.
The project is in part inspired by the way plants produce energy, and will use artificial photosynthesis to turn sunlight, water and carbon dioxide into clean fuel. Researchers will be charged with finding ways to use technologies like light absorbers, catalysts, molecular linkers and separation membranes to transform sunlight into fuel, and the DOE aims to quickly turn the research into a viable product in the form of fuel that can go directly into cars without any additional processing.
Artificial photosynthesis is not a new technology, and researchers at MIT and the University of Rochester have been seeking solutions for some time. The DOE hopes the Hub will spark collaborations to make more progress in the field.
The Hub will have two locations: One on Caltech’s campus in Pasadena and one at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley. Several other California universities will participate as well, including UC Santa Barbara, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. Funding will be provided over five years, with $22 million awarded this year and up to $25 million per year thereafter.

China is now the planet’s number one consumer of energy, overtaking the U.S. in the process. But at the same time, the U.S. has improved its energy efficient more so than China, meaning that the U.S. can get the same amount of work done while consuming less, say, coal or oil.
The actual numbers are pretty impressive, particularly when you consider that a mere 10 years ago China was quite a bit behind the U.S.
China consumed some 2,252 millions tons of the oil equivalent of sources such as coal, nuclear power, natural gas, and hydropower. The U.S. consumed 4 percent less. These are numbers from last year, by the way.
But that’s where energy efficiency comes into play. Since the year 2000, the U.S. has increased its energy efficiency by about 2.5 percent annually. China? 1.8 percent. So not a huge difference, but a difference nonetheless.
Does this really mean anything to you? Eh, maybe. Certainly it’ll have implications for the world at large though. Now that China is the biggest consumer of energy, it alone is in the position to tell energy providers, “Look, we’re willing to pay X for Y units of energy.” If China’s X is bigger than the U.S.’s X, then we may be looking at a situation where energy prices will go up simply because “someone else” is willing to pay more.
Which could mean that all the factories that produce all the lovely electronic gizmos we talk about day in, day out, could see their costs of doing business go up. And who would make up the difference? Yes, you!
Then again, it could have the very opposite effect, and end up lowering prices.
Or, better yet, the Sun could explode, making all of this moot. Hard to run a factory without the Sun churning away out there.

A solar-powered airplane, named the Solar Impulse, means to prove, once and for all, that harnessing the energy of the Sun is a good and practical idea. I mean, why would we try to capture some of the energy put out by a completely free nuclear reactor hanging in the sky? The plane took off from Switzerland a little bit ago, and will try to fly for 24 hours without stopping. Here’s hoping it’s a great success.
Should the flight prove successful it sure as heck will make the practice of drilling into the surface of the planet looking for a finite, and expensive to extract, power source seem awfully silly. “Hey, guys. You see that up there? It’s the Sun. It provides the energy that every single form of life on this planet needs to flourish. Why don’t we, I don’t know, try using some of that to power some of our odds and ends?”
But back to the airplane. Its maiden flight (voyage?) was back in April. This time the goal is to see if its solar cells (there’s 12,000 such cells) can power it for a single, nonstop 24-hour flight. It will fly at an altitude of 27,900 feet.
Being 2010 and all, you can follow the flight on Twitter, or, more interestingly, view a live video stream.

In the second quarter, cleantech venture investments worldwide totaled $2.02 billion across 140 companies, according to market research firm Cleantech Group and Deloitte. The numbers are in line with last quarter’s $2.04 billion, but 43% higher than one year ago.
Exits for the quarter totaled more than $8 billion globally, with $6 billion in cleantech M&A and $2.3 billion in cleantech IPOs.  Tesla‘s $202 million IPO has been in the spotlight recently, but globally, the cleantech IPO market is concentrated in China, which grabbed $1.7 billion, 75 percent of the $2.3 billion raised worldwide in the past three months, and 12 of the 19 IPOs, though not all of those are venture backed.  The biggest IPO of the quarter was China’s Origin Water on the Shenzen Stock Exchange, which raised $330 million.  As a point of comparison, in the U.S. alone, IPOs across all sectors totaled $900 million in the second quarter.

On the M&A front, there were 160 cleantech deals worldwide, including Switzerland’s ABB buying utility enterprise software maker Ventyx for more than $1 billion, and chip company Maxim buying smart-meter chip maker Teridian Semiconductor for $315 million.
In terms of venture funding, the most active cleantech investors in the quarter were Carbon Trust Investment Partners (6 deals), Kleiner Perkins (4 deals), Angeleno Group (3 deals), Draper Fisher Jurvetson (3 deals), and Khosla Ventures (3 deals).  Mega-deals of $100 million or more are on the rise, with four such deals in the quarter, including $175 million for Solyndra, $165 million for Landis+Gyr, $115 million for BrightSource Energy, and $129.4 million for Amonix.
The industry sectors drawing the most dollars were solar, biofuels, and smart grid.  Solar is one of the industry’s brightest shining stars, grabbing $811 million to mark its third highest quarter in history.

Investment in biofuels was also strong, soaring to $302 million since the the first quarter.

Spurred by the recession, investors are spending money on companies that can save money. Energy efficiency boasted 31 rounds of funding, trumping solar’s 26 and biofuels’ 13 deals.

Smart grid investments in particular experienced their highest quarter ever.

The Arlington, VA based company’s 10,000 square foot office in San Francisco’s South Park neighborhood will have room for between 75 and 100 employees, a large part of which will be engineers. “We signed a two-year sublease because we hope to grow out of that space,” says CEO Daniel Yates.
In Partovi, OPOWER is getting an experienced advisor who will help build the company in its plans to grow from 95 to 150 employees total in the coming year.  Partovi co-founded online music service iLike with his brother Ali, which they sold to MySpace, before leaving in April.  Previously, Partovi founded Tellme Networks, which was acquired by Microsoft for a reported $800 million.  Partovi also worked on IE5.
OPOWER provides utility companies with a way to engage customers with easy-to-understand home energy reports designed to inspire them to reduce consumption. OPOWER uses behavioral economics to provide each customer with a personalized analysis of their usage, taking into account their circumstances and lifestyle. 
“Instead of saying ‘you used this many kilowatts’, we say ‘you use 5% less or 20% more than your neighbors,'” says Senior Director of Marketing and Strategy Ogi Kavazovic.
The company has signed on 35 utility companies in 15 states across the country, including seven of the 10 biggest players. Yates says that by the end of this year, OPOWER will be saving more energy than the entire U.S. solar power industry is producing. The company is targeting north of $30 million in annual recurring revenue.

64,New solar cells printed on paper,https://techcrunch.com/2010/05/05/new-solar-cells-printed-on-paper/,2010/05/05,"
Everyone loves the idea of solar energy. The three big challenges are that solar cells are expensive to produce, they’re not very efficient, and you need some means to store the energy collected. I’d heard of solar shingles before, which are basically roofing shingles with solar cells in them, but now word is coming out of solar cells printed on paper. As usual, the technology is still years away from a marketable product, but it’s an interesting development.

The materials MIT researchers used are carbon-based dyes and the cells are about 1.5 percent to 2 percent efficient at converting sunlight to electricity. But any material could be used if it can be deposited at room temperature, Bulovic said. “Absolutely, the trick was coming up with ways to use paper,” he said.

According to Wikipedia, high efficiency solar cells run between 20% and 40% efficient, so these new paper cells still have ample room for improvement. The big advantage to printing solar cells on paper is a dramatically reduced weight, which means more application opportunities.
I haven’t heard any word on new battery technologies to go with these new solar cells. No doubt there’s some group of really smart people working to tackle that aspect of solar energy.

Fuel cells are on their way into the mainstream, even though the commercially available models are still pretty pricey. But there are companies like Kyoto-based Aquafairy [JP], for example, preparing affordable fuel cells, too. Their four new fuel cells are intended to make gadget fans in particular happy: the micro FC Stick (0.8W), the FC-Stick (2W), the FC-Cube (3W) and the FC-Cube Dual (6W).
The graphic above shows just a selection of gadgets that can be powered by these hydrogen/oxygen-based fuel cells (the video embedded below, for example, shows a robot that runs on two FC-Sticks). An FC-Stick can supply enough energy to charge a cell phone, while the FC-Cube is able to power a Nintendo DS. An FC-Cube Dual, connected to a lithium-ion battery, can power a standard notebook for about 3 hours.
Aquafairy is planning to sell their fuel cells, which consist of a power unit and a hydrogen cartridge, within this year (in Japan, at least). An FC-Stick, for example, will cost $22, with one cartridge setting buyers back $1.10 (the carts can be replaced).

66,"John Doerr On Bloom Energy Launch: ""This Is Like The Google IPO""",https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/24/doerr-bloom-energy-google-ipo/,2010/02/24,"

After eight years of operating in quasi-stealth, Bloom Energy came out with a bang today at an event in Silicon Valley attended by Arnold Schwarzenegger, Colin Powell, Larry Page, John Doerr, and executives from eBay, Walmart, Coca-Cola, and FedEx.  All of the big-name companies, including Google, are beta customers of Bloom’s distributed energy fuel cell technology (which was the subject of a 60 Minutes profile on Sunday and various other stories since then).
Doerr, the Kleiner Perkins VC who backed both Bloom and Google, said today: “This Is Like The Google IPO.”  Except without the IPO part.  Doerr was referring to the fact that, like Google, Bloom has kept its business close to its vest until it actually could show some progress in terms of customers and products.  Five Bloom energy boxes about the size of a parking space each now provide 15 percent of the power at eBay’s campus.  Walmart is testing the boxes in two locations where it is carrying 60 to 80 percent of the energy load of an entire store.  Google co-founder Larry Page calls the technology a “very big deal” and looks forward to the day that it can expand the number of Bloom boxes Google uses to the point where it can power one of its data centers.
Bloom founder and CEO KR Sridhar, who got his start designing technologies for NASA that would allow humans to live on Mars, explained how Bloom’s fuel cell technology works.  It takes almost any fuel from ethanol to biomass and turns it into electricity.  Fuel cells are nothing new, but Bloom has figured out a way to make them cheaply and efficiently.  A Sridhar claims that a Bloom box, which he calls an energy server, is twice as efficient as the electricity grid.  “For the same amount of electricity, you need half the fuel,” he says.  “If you use a renewable fuel you are carbon neutral. Use all the electricity you want and don’t feel guilty about polluting the environment.”

Each fuel cell, which is made from sand essentially (zirconium oxide), is a square wafer about the size of a CD box.  Each wafer can produce about 25 watts of energy, enough to power a lightbulb. Stack them together and you get a box that could power a house.  Group them into larger units, and you get enough energy to power a building or an entire campus.  He calls them energy servers because they are modular like servers in a data center. Need more energy?  Add more boxes.
They are like backyard generators. No electricity is lost through distribution, and they can convert a variety of fuels into electricity, allowing customers to use whatever is locally available or cheapest.  There are no moving parts, vents, or discharge other than heat.
Right now, only businesses and large facilities can afford these things.  They cost about $750,000 for a 100 kilowatt system (Google is using a 400 kilowatt systems to power one building on its campus, and the Walmart stores are also using 400 kilowatt systems).  Nevertheless, Bloom says the systems should pay for themselves within three to five years because of lower electricity costs.  A typical electricity cost for commercial customers is 8 to 10 cents per kilowatt-hour versus 13 cents for what they might pay a California utility.  That 3 to 5 cents per kilowatt-hour in savings adds up if you are running a huge retail store or a data center.
The costs should come down over time to the point where Bloom boxes really can be used in homes. One potentially disruptive feature of the technology is that it works both ways: fuel can produce electricity, but it can also go the other way so that electricity produces fuel.  Sridhar foresees the killer app for his technology becoming practical in about a decade: a Bloom home energy server combined with solar panels or some other renewable energy.  The electricity from the solar panels could produce fuel, which can be used to produce electricity to power the house or even to gas up your (modified) car.
Dreams like those are the kind that fuel something else: big IPOs. When’s the real one, Doerr?

This Saturday I’m probably going to wake up a little later (we have kids so that means like 8am) and maybe make some breakfast. Then maybe we’ll go for a walk in town here or the wife will take the kids to the Children’s Museum and I’ll do some writing. Then I’ll eat lunch with the fam, maybe watch a movie (probably some Disney stuff). The kids will eat dinner after that. That will make it about 6:30pm or so. The kids go to bed at 7pm so we’ll play with Legos for a while until it’s bathtime. Then they’ll go to bed and I’ll pour a glass of wine and wait for the age of fake endless free energy to sweep over us like a wave of Aquarian beauty, ending wars for oil forever and ushering in a new era of peace and tranquility.
Or maybe we’ll just watch the rest of season two of Breaking Bad. That show totally kicks ass.
Steorn, for those who forgot, is that Irish company offering up promises of overunity, one of the most popular perpetual motion scams. Here’s a delightful video:

Perpetual motion proponents always call themselves heretics. It becomes a religious argument to “deny” their discoveries and, as a result, they make people angry and they become indignant freedom fighters. After all, they burned Galileo for heresy!

69,RCA Airnergy promises usable power generated from Wi-Fi signals. Possible?,https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/13/rca-airnergy-promises-usable-power-generated-from-wi-fi-signals-possible/,2010/01/13,"
I’m a simple man. I understand certain things. How ambient Wi-Fi signals could be converted into enough energy to charge a BlackBerry is something I do NOT understand. However, RCA not only showed off the technology at CES but the device will apparently be available by the summer and it’ll only cost $40.

OhGizmo! tells us the following:

The Airnergy Charger is amazing.
This little box has, inside it, some kind of circuitry that harvests WiFi energy out of the air and converts it into electricity. This has been done before, but the Airnergy is able to harvest electricity with a high enough efficiency to make it practically useful: on the CES floor, they were able to charge a BlackBerry from 30% to full in about 90 minutes, using nothing but ambient WiFi signals as a power source.

So here’s where things get convoluted. Instead of just writing it off as crazy vaporware, you can’t help but consider the following:
1. It’s got a brand name that people have heard of and they’ve put a date and a price on it already. Granted, RCA isn’t so much of a company nowadays. It’s more of a purchasable brand, but you’d hope they wouldn’t license the name out to just anyone.
2. The technology apparently exists (according to the nerds over on Slashdot), yet it hasn’t been powerful enough to generate the juice to charge anything worthwhile. In this instance, it charged a BlackBerry “from 30% to full in about 90 minutes.”
If it does indeed work, imagine future applications of this technology. Your cell phone battery would eventually have it all built in and it’d recharge itself all day – even at just a trickle – whenever you were within range of Wi-Fi signals. For many of us, that’s most of the day.
I can’t honestly say if it’s bogus or not. Most of the sentiment from the commenters on the various blogs who have written about this thing has been more on the negative side. I contacted Mr. Wizard for his take but, alas, he passed away in 2007.
Any geniuses out there care to weigh in?

70,Privacy versus power: smart grids are the new battlefield,https://techcrunch.com/2009/11/19/privacy-versus-power-smart-grids-are-the-new-battlefield/,2009/11/19,"
I think we can all agree that protecting our own personal privacy is a generally good idea. There are an enormous number of ways that our privacy can be encroached in a given day. Some of them are “for our own good”, or “just the cost of doing business” in the modern age. Some of the ways our privacy may be violated are extremely esoteric and not very likely (hard drive activity LEDs, for example! PDF: Information Leakage from Optical Emanations). Generally speaking, what I do in my own home is largely my own business, and not the business of anyone else. But the technology behind so-called “smart grids” for delivering electricity to appliances in a way that maximizes efficiency may leak a lot of personal information about you and your domestic habits.
ReadWriteWeb ponders the question are smart grids undermining user privacy? The story observes that “the energy fluctuations of home appliances are so unique that a smart grid can tell the make and model of a user’s refrigerator.” Maybe that’s not a big deal to you, but it’s not too hard to extrapolate from there to a variety of more Orwellian possibilities.
The issue at hand currently is that there are no clear guidelines on how to collect user data in a smart grid. Left to their own devices, history suggests that companies involved with smart grid technology will not necessarily keep the privacy of consumers in mind as they pursue their business objectives. But maybe this is all much ado about nothing, and end-user privacy will in some way be sanctified and protected as more and more people become aware of the issue. What do you think?

Yes, your refrigerator, washer, and dryer may be Energy Star certified, but any good you’re doing is offset by your DVD player, TV and computer. That’s the simplified version of a new International Energy Agency report that says white goods—refrigerator, washing machines, etc.—are a lot more energy efficient than they used to be, but that consumer electronics—computers, TVs, etc—haven’t made the same progress. And we’re all doomed for it.
If people don’t stop buying these inefficient electronic devices, electricity consumptions will triple by 2030. (And how much is your electricity bill now?) That’s because energy consumption has increased, worldwide, an average of 3.4 percent per year since 1990. Not too many of us had multiple laptops, HDTVs, video game systems, charging cellphones, etc. all plugged in simultaneously, did we?
You may remember that the state of California was looking to curb the use of plasma and LCD HDTVs because they use so much energy. It’s all related, folks.

Everyone loves solar power, right? It’s basically an infinitely renewable resource — at least for as long as any of us care — and it’s free. FREE!

Take Solaren, for example. They’re hoping to work with Pacific Gas & Electric to create space-based solar energy collectors.
To my untrained eye, this looks like something lifted straight from a G.I. Joe storyline. Satellites in space — presumably using a geosynchronous orbit — will collect and store solar energy. They’ll convert it to radio waves and beam it down to Earth, where it will be collected by a station in Fresno, CA. There it will be converted to electricity and distributed out on the power grid.
The comments in the DailyTech article are worth a read, too. The original story — much like this one! — is light on details. The commenters fill in some of the gaps about the practicalities of this solution.

Oops. Apparently all the computers in the US that are rarely, if ever, shut down at night account for almost $3 billion in wasted energy costs and “may emit up to 20 million tons of carbon dioxide.” 
According to Scientific American:

“A study released last week puts a finer point on this assertion, reporting that U.S. workers waste $2.8 billion annually in energy costs by failing to shut off their PCs at the end of the work day. What’s more, machines left on during off hours may emit up to 20 million tons of carbon dioxide (C02) this year alone, roughly the equivalent impact of four million cars.”

Apparently about 50% of people leave their computers on overnight for various reasons including forgetting to turn them off, not wanting to wait for them to shut down, and so they can receive software updates. Responses were collected “from 4,743 U.S. computer users over the age of 18, about half of whom were employed.” The study also found that Germany could save $1.2 billion and the UK could save $400 million by turning off their computers.
Me, I’m a standby man myself. I always thought that the boot-up process used more energy than letting the computer sit idle for a while.

Asura just opened the first-of-its-kind thermal energy plant in California, which should generate enough electricity to power some 3,500 homes. The best part is that this plant, which is named Kimberlina, is merely a proof of concept of sorts— the real plant, to be constructed by 2010, will generate enough electricity to power, like, 120,000 homes.
The idea is dead simple: you’ve got really long mirrors (1,000 feet, to be exact) which reflect the sun’s rays. These rays are reflected onto a series of tubes that are filled with water. The water heats up and turns into steam, which in turn spins power-generating turbines. Makes you wanna become an engineer, doesn’t it?
Detractors will likely say, “That’s easy for California to do since it’s bathed in sunlight every day.” Granted, but should the technology prove efficient, what’s to stop the state from becoming an energy breadbasket of sorts to other states?

80,Greening the geek house,https://techcrunch.com/2008/04/23/greening-the-geek-house/,2008/04/23,"
Go downstairs and check out your power meter. It’s probably spinning frantically. Why? Because you’re blowing electricity out of your home theatre set-up and home office like a fiend. Don’t worry: I’m doing it to. We all are. It’s the cost of staying online and entertained these days and, sometimes when I’m in the basement, I kind of get a twinge of embarrassment that the woman who lived here before me, a woman who died at 92, used so little electricity that ConEd called me after we moved in asking me if there was anything wrong.
As a homeowner, I’m acutely aware of wasted energy. I feel it in my utility bills, mostly, and that’s one great way to gauge your usage. Another way is to go around the house with the P3 P4400 Kill A Watt electricity meter. I just ordered one in hopes of assessing what mess of electronics is causing my bills to be so high.
But we all know what it is, right? It’s all of the junk that leeches phantom power while we sleep. The TiVo, the XBox, the Blu-Ray player, the Fleshlight charger. That’s why my next purchase is the Belkin Conserve power supply with remote control. To shut down all the junk you don’t use, simply press the little magnetic button. Another tip? Unplug your junk when it’s done charging. Seriously. Your PSP doesn’t need any more juice.
Going further afield, I’ve done some research into getting solar panels on my roof. While Brooklyn isn’t known as the sun capital of the world, many solar panel experts believe that almost any home can benefit from a little sky juice. I checked out Sharp’s solar calculator and found that installing panels on my home would cost about $15,000 and net 73% savings. While this is a little expensive, it could potentially save me quite a bit in the summer months when our roof gets lots of direct sunshine. I found a $9,999 solution as well, but your best bet is to find an installer. Solar Home offers a free assessment, which I’ve just signed up for.
Finally, we can talk about food. We ‘merican’s eat crap and we geeks eat even worse crap. I’ll admit it: if I had my druthers I’d eat Doritos and drink Rolling Rock all day long. But this stuff requires gasoline and packaging and makes a huge mess. How about fairly farm fresh produce and a nice homebrew?
I currently make my own wine and beer with kits from Northern Brewer and Mr. Beer, respectively. Why? Because it makes great booze, you recycle your bottles, and you don’t have to buy Fraunch Wine (c) from Francia and have it shipped over in a messy plane or boat.
We also try to hit the farmer’s market as much as we can and buy lots of vegetables. Clearly you’re not going to pull me away from my bacon, but I got some ramps and baby potatoes today that are going to taste great and won’t have been shipped from California by truck. We’re efficient infrastructure hackers, aren’t we? Why can’t we treat this like a programming problem?
This advice is mainly home-based, clearly, but we all gotta sleep somewhere and by making things a bit more efficient we can keep from burning up the planet that holds most of our data centers.

81,World's most powerful laser developed in Texas,https://techcrunch.com/2008/04/17/worlds-most-powerful-laser-developed-in-texas/,2008/04/17,"
Straight out of the University of Texas at Austin comes the world’s most powerful laser. I just assumed that most lasers were very powerful, but apparently the great state of Texas has the best one until someone else can come along and build an even more powerful laser or mounts this same laser to a shark’s head.

According to Gizmag.com,

“With greater than one quadrillion watts of laser power, the level of output achieved on March 31 by the Texas Petawatt laser is equivalent to more than 2,000 times the output of all power plants in the United States and brighter than the Sun’s surface, according team leader and physicist at The University of Texas at Austin, Dr. Todd Ditmire.
The one quadrillion watt laser burst, which lasts just a 10th of a trillionth of a second (0.0000000000001 second) will be used to study the secrets of the universe by enabling examination of gases at extreme temperatures solids at pressures of many billions of atmospheres – even creating mini-supernovas and exploring energy made by controlled fusion.”

That sounds very nice (impossible, but nice). Maybe, though, we could use the beam for energy since it’s more than 2,000 times the output of all power plants in the United States. I’m all for studying the universe, but maybe we could eradicate everyone’s home energy bills and then I’ll personally promise to donate half of what my bill used to be to this project. Everyone wins! Also, if you could make a laser that does the same for natural gas, my Comcast bill, the wife’s cell phone bill and car payment, and maybe even my rent somehow, that’d be really cool too.

82,"Longer-lasting, safer lithium-ion batteries coming?",https://techcrunch.com/2008/04/10/longer-lasting-safer-lithium-ion-batteries-coming/,2008/04/10," People who wear lab coats somewhere in Illinois (Argonne, to be exact) have reportedly developed a lithium-ion battery that’s capable of storing 30 percent more energy while at the same time being safer than current lithium-ion batteries.
What’s more, the technology has been licensed to Japanese laptop battery manufacturer Toda Kogyo, so we might actually see these batteries in notebook iterations relatively soon.

Here’s how it all works, according to MIT’s Technology Review…

The Argonne researchers have improved the performance of the positive electrodes by increasing the chemical and structural stability of the materials already used in laptop batteries. In conventional lithium-ion batteries, which have cobalt oxide electrodes, a small amount of overheating, caused by overcharging the material or by electrical shorts inside a battery, can lead to rapidly increasing temperatures inside the cell and, in some cases, combustion. That’s because, as the material overheats, the cobalt oxide readily gives up oxygen, which reacts with the solvent in the battery’s electrolyte and generates more heat, feeding the reactions. The Argonne researchers addressed this problem by replacing some of the cobalt oxide with manganese oxide, which is chemically more stable.

Ah, so that was it all along — we just needed to replace some cobalt oxide with some manganese oxide. I have a whole jar of low-fat manganese oxide in my fridge.

In the 1960s most of America assumed that by 2008 we’d be driving nuclear-powered cars around. Even in Back to the Future the Delorian was powered by Mr. Fusion. But alas, anyone can tell you that we’re still chained to oil-powered internal combustion engines, just as we have been for 100 years.
But a new material scienticians have developed might pave the way for nuclear-powered cars in the near future. The material takes nuclear decay and can convert it to electricity far more efficiently than ever before. Spacecraft have been using this type of “nuclear battery” for decades to propel them through space, but it’s never been effective enough for terrestrial use.
More tests are needed, but the nano-tech based polymers could be adapted to be more energy efficient, enough so that they could drive a standard-sized American car. And it would do so cleanly.
The scienticians say we’re still at least a decade out from utilizing the technology, but it’s entirely possible we can hang up the pumps by then.

Anyhoo, if you’re in the market for a huge remote controlled submersible robot that weighs 50 tons and can bury oil and gas pipes at the bottom of the ocean, look no further than the Ultra Trencher 1 by a company called SMD. It uses propellers to submerge itself to depths up to a mile and then uses ninja-like high-pressure “jet swords” to cut a trench in the ocean floor. Pipes can then be safely buried out of the way of shipwrecks, fishing equipment, and currents.

85,Virgin 747 to go from London to Amsterdam on biofuel,https://techcrunch.com/2008/02/05/virgin-747-to-go-from-london-to-amsterdam-on-biofuel/,2008/02/05,"  
Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Atlantic airline will conduct a test flight at the end of the month wherein a Boeing 747 will fly from London to Amsterdam using an 80/20 blend of conventional fuel and biofuel, respectively. The plane will carry no passengers but will be “the first time a commercial aircraft has flown on biofuel,” according to the San Francisco Chronicle. 

Branson announced this little experiment last year and analysts posited that it could be done by the end of 2008. With this experiment, Virgin announced that it’s about 10 months ahead of schedule. How do you like them apples? Not only is something in the technology happening ahead of schedule without being delayed, but a full ten months ahead of schedule. 
Here’s more…

From the business perspective, the airlines are under great financial pressure because of soaring fuel costs; the price of crude oil is consistently flirting with $100 per barrel. On the environmental side of things, aircraft represent up to 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions produced by the U.S. transportation sector, according to the Environmental Protection Agency… 
…To get it done, Virgin Atlantic is teaming with Boeing and GE Aviation, maker of the engines that power the airplane. The airline said the GE Aviation CF6 engines used during the flight will not require modifications to burn biofuel, nor will the biofuel have negative effects on the engines. 
The fuel used in the flight will be a blend of 80 percent conventional jet fuel, which is essentially kerosene, and 20 percent biofuel. Although the exact type of biofuel to be used has not been disclosed, the airline said it is a form that does not compete with food and freshwater resources.

Exciting, no? We’ll keep an eye out for an exact flight date and update everyone.

86,Snickers + Caffeine + Taurine = recipe for success,https://techcrunch.com/2008/01/28/snickers-caffeine-taurine-recipe-for-success/,2008/01/28,"
Man oh man, do I miss Snickers. When I worked in an office, I used to eat one (and only one) each day. Yum. Now that there’s going to be a Snickers bar infused with caffeine, taurine, and B vitamins, I’m going to have to seriously reconsider starting up my Costco membership again. 

So how does it taste? Let’s check in with Candy Blog.

It smells much like the regular Snickers, has the same texture … same crunchy peanuts, chewy caramel and super-sweet nougat with a hit of salt. And then it comes along, the caffeine kick. And when I say kick, I mean in the mouth. It’s a bitter aftertaste that sits high and in the back of the mouth. It just kind of lingers there, like maybe it’s not something you ate but something you smelled (sometimes strong skunk will do that to me). And it stays with you, probably as long as the caffeine is in your system. I clocked my aftertaste for eating one half of a bar at 90 minutes.

I’m willing to put up with the strong-skunk aftertaste but I’m somewhat of a buzz junkie. You’ll probably have a hard time trying to get “regular” people to eat these but, at the same price as a regular Snickers bar, you won’t be out too much if your grandma doesn’t like the taste.
I’m not sure if these are available yet, as Candy Blog got some samples directly from Mars, Inc. but I’ll be checking my local convenience and grocery stores like a hawk.

Oil prices are getting out of hand. Wind and solar power are somewhat unpredictable and apparently they ‘cost too much’. A few weeks back I saw Southland Tales and the movie was about the end of the world and all this other crazy stuff. What was intriguing about the film other than Sarah Michelle Geller being a porn star was the fact that alternative energy was being pumped from the ocean. It’s not rocket science (or maybe something close to it), but I’d imagine building a huge turbine of some sort would produce massive amounts of free energy, right?
Well, Finavera Renewables has this thing called the Aquabuoy that’s a buoy connected to an underwater piston. Can you figure out how it works? No? Ok, fine. As swells roll through, the buoy goes with the flow and goes up and down. This in turn gets the piston running, which pressurizes a chamber that’s inhabited by seawater. Said pressure gets the turbine running, which if you haven’t figured it out by now produces electricity. That’s cool but so what?
Well, Finavera just scored a deal with PG&E in Nor*Cal. The power purchase is for a wave farm that will produce 2 megawatts of juice and said wave farm will be built 2.5 miles off the coast of Humboldt County. It won’t actually be up and running until 2012, but it will offset 245 tons of carbon dioxide each year and if all goes well, Finavera hopes to build the wave farm into a 100 megawatt producing rig.

But all is not well with this glorious idea. It’s more expensive to run than coal and natural gas, but it’s cheaper than offshore wind turbines and solar. A recent test run off the coast of Oregon was a bust when the buoy sank when it took on water. My alma mater has been working on this for quite some time and the O.H. Hinsdale Wave Research Lab is a world class facility where they study tsunamis and anything else going on in the ocean. Someone told me the head of the center surfs in the wave pool after hours, which is rad. Anyway, things are looking up for renewables, but we’re a long ways away from seeing anything actually happen on this front.

I live near MIT and every time I’m over near the campus, I like to look at all the people and try to figure out who’s legitimately an insane homeless person and who’s a genius that’s been working on a project like this and hasn’t slept or showered in a week. If you’re one of the latter, nice work!

My position is “no, it would not.”
The aforementioned money was given to Australia’s national science agency as a grant in the hopes that it could develop an “electrojacket” that “uses what are called Piezoelectric materials to transform kinetic energy into storable power.”
Its intended use will be for military personnel and will (hopefully) allow them to eschew all the little battery packs needed to power the many various gadgets they have strapped to them while in the field of battle. The energy that’s created by the soldiers’ movement will theoretically power many of those devices. The technology could also have practical applications in the private and medical device sectors as well.

The less-than-one-cubic-centimeter device is said to be 10 times more efficient than current devices and eliminates the need to change out the batteries, something that’s long-been a tricky task. In a pacemaker, the device would draw power from the vibrations created by the beating of the human heart. Unreal. 
By removing excess wires and batteries, these devices are now able to be placed in previously hard-to-reach places and can be fitted with larger sensors. Beyond the benefits to the pacemaker crowd, these devices could also be used to monitor structural conditions in roads and bridges.
Although in its current state this generator is only able to produce mere microwatts of electricity, one would think that eventually this technology could be used to power all sorts of low-energy devices like the keyfob that you use to unlock your car or maybe even your TV’s remote control.
