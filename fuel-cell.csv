0,Toyota’s ‘Fine-Comfort Ride’ fuel cell concept aims for long-range flexibility,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/18/toyotas-fine-comfort-ride-fuel-cell-concept-aims-for-long-range-flexibility/,2017/10/18,"
Toyota is debuting a new concept vehicle for the forthcoming Tokyo Motor Show, and it’s a fuel cell vehicle that’s designed to get around 1,000 km (around 621 miles) on a single hydrogen pack that can be refuelled in about 3 minutes total. The concept looks like an aggressively future-styled minivan, though it’s billed as a “premium saloon,” and it’s got an interior design that emphasizes second row seating space.
The Fine-Comfort Ride is designed to be flexible in its seat configuration, so that it can use used maximally by just one occupant, or rather as a meeting or communication and collaboration room for a group.

It’s also got a virtual Agent built into touch displays on the driver and passenger windows and screens, for a full surround infotainment experience. The motors are in the wheels, positioned at the absolute outside edges of the car, too, which Toyota says makes for silent running and quite operation.
There are also no dividing pillars separating the front and rear seats, and the bucket seating looks like lounge furnishings from a Blade Runner movie. It’s actually a super cool vision of future mobility, albeit probably not a particularly realistic one.
Toyota should have plenty more to show off at the Tokyo Motor Show next week, so stay tuned for more big reveals, and hopefully more far-out concepts.

1,GM to introduce two new all-electric cars by 2019 in path to zero emissions,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/02/gm-to-introduce-two-new-all-electric-cars-by-2019-in-path-to-zero-emissions/,2017/10/02,"
GM today announced a strategy to eventually deliver a zero emission product line across all its segments, though it didn’t put a specific timeline on when it would achieve that goal. The process is complex, said Mark Reuss, EVP Global Product Development, and GM doesn’t see there being “one year where we flip a switch and it’s all electric.”
Still, GM is committing to rolling out two new all-electric vehicles within the next 18 months, and to having at least 20 new all-electric vehicles in the market by 2023. GM also debuted its new SURUS fuel-cell concept platform today, which is a four-wheel steering concept truck-based vehicle with two electric motors and a flexible design which could work with a range of different vehicles in commercial capacities, including delivery vehicles, trucks or ambulances.
This build on previous declarations made by GM CEO Mary Barra, who announced that the company is ultimately committed to world with zero emissions, and zero crashed. The Chevrolet Bolt has helped immensely with progress towards the zero emissions part, Reuss said.
He noted that GM has sold “thousands” of the Bolt in its first year, and that Chevrolet customers “love them.” Reuss also added that the Bolt is a “window into how GM will move humanity forward in the future, with all-electric propulsion.”
Reuss added that “GM believes the future is all-electric,” and that “these aren’t just words in a war of press releases,” referring to the spate of recent announcements by automakers committing to offering either hybrid or electric versions of their entire lineup by some future date. GM cautioned that its approach will be more methodical, however, and based on user feedback.
“An electric solution cannot be one size fits all,” Reuss said. “We believe you need both battery electric and fuel cell electric… how we apply each of these technologies will depend on what we hear from customers about their needs.”
Meanwhile, GM said it will continue to increase efficiency of fuel injection vehicles to facilitate the transition. Reuss noted that GM has advantages in this race because
“light weighting of vehicles has been a priority over many years,” even with its fuel cars, and you then combine that with the agility of the battery pack, and GM’s strategy of reducing the coast of battery packs in use by reducing the size of the battery pack itself to find its competitive advantage.
Reuss repeatedly emphasized the importance of fuel cell electric in GM’s zero emission strategy, since it’ll become part of both consumer retail and military, commercial, utility segments for the automaker. He said that they’ll start with commercial infrastructure to support such a rollout, and then have that transition to informing the retail segment infrastructure rollout as well.

2,Honda Clarity grows from one-shot to series,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/22/honda-clarity-grows-from-one-shot-to-series/,2017/06/22,"
For years, the Honda Clarity has been one thing: a hydrogen fuel-cell-powered sedan available for lease to a vetted group of early adopters in California. Now in its third generation, the Honda Clarity fuel-cell car is still basically that. But it’s getting a couple of friends.
This year, the Honda Clarity adds two new versions: an all-electric car and a plug-in hybrid. Granted, the fuel cell Clarity is technically an electric car, but the electric version charges at any outlet rather than being fueled at a so-far rare hydrogen fueling station.
The three were shown together for the first time in the United States since their unveiling at the New York Auto Show at the Drive Revolution event in Portland, Oregon. Journalists had the chance to drive them back to back to evaluate their similarities and differences over short urban routes — and to compare them to their energy-efficient competitors. There are, of course, similarities in the design; these are all Clarity models. There are subtle differences in the grilles, and they have badging specific to their drivetrain type, but otherwise they are identical large four-door sedans.
This one-car-many-powertrains strategy is one other manufacturers are using, as well, especially when it comes to advanced drivetrain technologies. Hyundai, for example, has the Ioniq series, with hybrid, PHEV and EV versions. As Natalie Kumaratne, a Clarity specialist for Honda, pointed out, this makes it easier for manufacturers to respond to changes in consumers’ buying habits.
Right now, PHEVs are gaining in popularity, and the Clarity PHEV will be available in all 50 states. The Clarity fuel cell is only available in California because that’s where the infrastructure exists to make these cars practical. The Clarity EV is somewhere in the middle of that mix. When hydrogen stations become more widespread, or when EV demand reaches a tipping point, the mix can change at the factory in Japan more easily than if these were separate models.
Driving dynamics for the three cars are very similar, but ranges are wildly different. The EV has a range of about 90 miles per charge; the PHEV drives 42 miles on electric power alone and 330 miles with the gasoline engine; and the fuel cell can travel 366 miles, the highest range of any zero-emissions vehicle in the country.
Kumaratne noted that Honda is all in on fuel cell technology. The company sees it as a major part of its electrification process, and it has set a goal of selling 75,000 total Clarity vehicles in the United States in the next four years. That’s part of its larger goal of having 60 percent or more of its sales worldwide be electric vehicles by 2030.

3,Toyota Mirai’s fuel cell system scales up for semi trucks,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/19/toyota-mirais-fuel-cell-system-scales-up-for-semi-trucks/,2017/04/19,"
The Toyota Mirai fuel-cell electric vehicle is so far a niche vehicle, but that hasn’t stopped Toyota from dreaming big — really big. Project Portal is a proof of concept semi truck that runs on a scaled-up version of the Mirai’s powertrain.
The Mirai is an four-door car, though, with a maximum weight of two tons. The proof of concept vehicle needs to haul 80,000 pounds, the combined gross vehicle weight of a big rig. So how many times do you have to scale the Mirai system to create that kind of power? Twice, according to Tak Yakoo, a senior executive engineer at Toyota.
“A semi is 36 tons, 18 times the size of a Mirai,” Yakoo said in a phone interview. “But we only use twice as much fuel cell and a relatively small battery.” The battery modules are flexible, so you can add more for a huge truck or fewer for a little passenger car or SUV. The scalability of the Mirai system is the point of the exercise, Yakoo said.
“Cars have so many different sizes of engines — 1.4L, 2.0L, 3.5L, etc.,” Yakoo said. “This is one standard fuel cell system with only a change of battery module size. That’s the dramatic change.” The system in the vehicle shown today at the Port of Los Angeles creates 670 hp and 1,325 lb-ft of torque, enough to move a full tractor-trailer and keep it moving down the highway.
For this concept, the engineers simply removed the components related to the diesel drive train and replaced them with the hydrogen fuel cell system. Taking out the diesel engine “leaves a huge space,” Yakoo said with a laugh. “Using that, we brought in the power electric controlling system, the fuel cells, the electric motor, and the fuel tank.” The tank did have to be fitted behind the cab for this demonstration vehicle.
This is only the beginning of Project Portal, a feasibility study in the use of zero-emissions vehicles for heavy duty. Toyota will begin working on the study along with the Port of Los Angeles’s Clean Air Action Plan this summer.
Toyota isn’t the only company working on emissions-free long-haul trucks. Nikola Motor Company has the Nikola One concept, and Elon Musk announced via tweet that Tesla will introduce a heavy-duty truck later this year.
It’s a tough nut to crack, though. “There are many unknown engineering things we need to explore,” Yakoo said. “We may not even know what is the sticking point or bottleneck” in these early stages of the project. “We are sure right now that I am seeing a fuel cell truck moving with 80,000 pounds of freight.”
Toyota’s overall goal is to produce one fuel cell system to rule them all, no matter the size. As Yakoo said at the end of our interview, “Scalability. That’s our dream — and my dream — to make it happen.”

4,GM and Honda partner to mass produce hydrogen fuel cells in Michigan,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/30/gm-and-honda-partner-to-mass-produce-hydrogen-fuel-cells-in-michigan/,2017/01/30,"
Automakers GM and Honda are teaming up on a new venture to jointly manufacture hydrogen fuel cells at scale, with plans to start mass production by 2020 and a combined investment of $85 million split evenly between the two companies dedicated to the effort. Both GM and Honda intend to use the resulting hydrogen fuel cell system in future products, according to the companies.
The joint venture, which will be called Fuel Cell System Manufacturing, LLC, will build the fuel cells at GM’s existing Brownstown, Michigan-based battery pack construction facility, where it currently assembles battery packs for its Volt and Bolt EVs.
GM has been working on hydrogen fuel cell technology for quite some time across a number of industries. It’s working with the U.S. Navy on a fuel-cell powered submarine drone, for instance, and it’s also been developing a Colorado ZH2 test truck for the U.S. Army with a fuel cell powertrain that has a lot of flexibility when it comes to mission-based use.
Overall, the company has invested around $3 billion in development of fuel-cell tech, and is looking to field a fuel cell vehicle for consumers as soon as 2020. GM announced a partnership with Honda to develop production fuel cell technology back in 2013, and their timelines were remarkably similar to the one announced today. The companies also revealed their new, much smaller and more compact fuel cell design.
Dan Nicholson, VP of Global Propulsion Systems at General Motors said at a press conference announcing the joint venture that “we can safely say that today’s announcement officially marks the arrival of fuel cells.”

Honda has a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle available already, in the FCX Clarity. The sedan will be joined by two other models, a fully electric and a plug-in hybrid, later this year.
By combining their efforts, Honda and GM are hoping to help drive manufacturing costs lower, faster. Demand for fuel cell systems across both automakers will help boost scale, and since the two are collaborating on sourcing, they’ll be able to achieve better prices for components from suppliers, too.
Fuel cell technology has significant advantages in terms of range and efficiency vs. both traditional fossil fuel vehicles and purely electric options, with advantages when it comes to refuelling times vs. electric charge.

5,DOE small biz voucher awards include vehicles and fuel cells,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/31/doe-small-biz-voucher-awards-include-vehicles-and-fuel-cells/,2016/08/31,"
The US Department of Energy has awarded $8 million in Small Business Vouchers to 43 businesses, including ten projects aimed at making hydrogen fuel cells cheaper and more efficient, and six projects that will improve vehicle fuel efficiency, including better batteries.
In addition to funding from the DOE, participants in this second round of the SBV project will be working with 12 of the DOE’s national laboratories to accelerate the development of their technologies. For example, Nzyme2HC is paired with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to generate hydrogen for fuel cells using, among other things, industrial waste. The SBV award allows Nzyme2HC to prototype and test the cleaner — and potentially cheaper — hydrogen fuel at NREL.
Vehicle technologies range from improved computer modeling and simulations to fuel innovations. Saratoga Energy is developing a process to manufacture graphite from carbon dioxide to be used in lithium-ion batteries for EVs, while Sylvatex is designing a nanoparticle fuel system to reduce emissions and incorporate renewables in petroleum with assistance from the Argonne National Laboratory.
The SBV project isn’t just for vehicles and related technology; other awards were in the Bioenergy, Buildings, Geothermal, Solar, Water, and Wind categories. Round one of the project launched in March with 33 vouchers totaling $6.7 million awarded. To get a piece of that funding pie in a future round, visit the project’s website to apply. More info will be available there in October 2016.

6,You’re In Trouble If This Pee-Powered Energy System Leaks,https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/14/youre-in-trouble-if-this-pee-powered-energy-system-leaks/,2015/12/14,CONTENT ERROR
7,I Drove Toyota’s Car Of The Future And It Was Boring,https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/18/i-drove-toyotas-car-of-the-future-and-it-was-boring/,2014/09/18,"
While Tesla is getting everyone excited about the idea of sexy electric cars in every driveway, Toyota has been working on a different technological roadmap: The carmaker that made the hybrid category with the Prius thinks that the next generation of cars will be fueled by hydrogen, and it’s going to beat everyone to market with a model coming next year.
Earlier this week I got a chance to drive a couple of Toyota’s test models. One was an older Highlander, a small “SUV” that was based on the Camry platform. It was running on Toyota’s older hydrogen tech, but looked and felt like a real car — the interior was set up like a car you could have found on a lot five years ago.
The other model was a “mule,” built to test the latest hardware without giving away what the production model looks like, inside or out. This car was much lighter than the fuel-cell-powered Highlander, resulting in better performance than the Highlander-based model. Of course, it was also wrapped in a swirl-patterned skin that drew some odd gazes, and the interior was basically a duct-taped mess.
Testing oddities aside, my drives in Toyota’s fuel-cell cars were uneventful. Starting in the parking lots behind AT&T Park in San Francisco, I drove both cars down the Embarcadero and then through SOMA. Despite the cramped awfulness of dealing with San Francisco’s streets and drivers, I didn’t have any issues. Both cars were totally capable of picking up speed to make it through short lights and of stopping immediately when drivers in front of me spaced out entirely.
While the Highlander’s infotainment screen had a mode that showed where power was coming from (the car has a fuel cell and a Prius-sized battery), for the most part it just felt like driving a car that runs on gasoline or diesel.
That seems to be what Toyota is going for with its hydrogen-powered cars. In addition to announcing that it would have a fuel cell car for sale in the United States next year, the company has also been investing in the rollout of a hydrogen-fuel infrastructure in California that should be ready in time for the vehicle’s 2015 launch.
That means that if you live in Southern California or the Bay Area, you could buy a hydrogen-powered car next year and have an experience that isn’t too far from what you’d get with a gas guzzler: You’d still have about 300 miles of driving per tank, and you’d still have to go to a filling station when that tank runs out. The only differences would be that you’ll be driving a car with no engine sounds or harmful emissions (fuel cells simply create water as exhaust).
While I didn’t get to drive the actual car Toyota plans to release next year (expect them to release details, including what the interior looks like and the power train’s specs over the coming months so that this thing stays in the news — I did get to see what the final car will look like. Surprisingly, the car, which Toyota tells me will cost “more than a Prius but less than a Tesla,” still looks a lot like the concept vehicle Toyota first showed off early this year.

8,ClearEdge Power Wins $2.8 Million Grant To Evangelize Fuel Cells,https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/14/clearedge-power-pnnl-doe-grant/,2011/06/14," On Tuesday, ClearEdge Power— a cleantech startup that makes 5-kilowatt stationary fuel cells— announced that it won a $2.8 million grant from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to gets its technology out to the market more quickly. Targeted customers for ClearEdge Power include the owners and operators of hotels, groceries, schools, medical centers and fast food restaurants, among other light industrial power users.
The ClearEdge5 fuel cell (image, below) is about the size of a regular home refrigerator and produces power from natural gas. It is also designed to recycle the heat it generates for use within a facility where it is installed. Heat generated by the fuel cells’ power production can be harnessed, for example, to warm up a pool, a laundry room or the air in a building.
The PNNL grant project is part of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Fuel Cell Technologies Program, and is one of a slew of activities designed to: “support the development and deployment of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies, [domestically]” according to a PNNL press statement. Through the grant, PNNL funds up to 50 percent of the total project cost for each system ClearEdge Power installs.

Given $2.8 million in funding, ClearEdge Power agreed to install 38 systems for ten organizations that the company hand-picked because they were reputed sustainability leaders in their industries or geographic regions. As part of the deal, the organizations that get the half-priced systems and services agreed to allow PNNL access to their fuel cell’s performance data for five years [updated: Jun. 14, 2011 7:45 p.m. ET].
The grant is a first-of-its-kind award, according to PNNL project manager Mike Rinker. Most D.O.E. grants are to advance research and development and manufacturing, he explained.
Rinker’s team chose ClearEdge Power for the grant because, he said, “They had a system that was commercially available already in the 5-kilowatt to 100-kilowatt range, and could be deployed quickly.”
The ClearEdge5 uses an electrochemical process to convert natural gas (or propane) to electricity and heat. It’s a smaller unit than those offered by Bloom Energy, UTC Power or Fuel Cell Energy.
The company claims its systems: reduces the environmental impact of producing electricity by reducing carbon dioxide emissions by about 35 to 40 percent compared to traditional combustion power generation, and by avoiding the emission of volatile organic compounds, ash and particulates, to trace levels.
PNNL’s Rinker also noted:


“It’s hard to determine which sectors within the category of light industrial power users are the biggest consumers of energy from fossil fuels. It varies regionally, for one. Most companies in this category are grid-connected so they take what the utility can give them.
In Southern California and Northern California, a lot of that power comes from coal*. That’s why it makes sense to introduce businesses in this area, and in this category, or in areas that have access to a natural gas pipeline to fuel cell alternatives.
With companies like a 24-7 medical center, a hotel or a fast food restaurant that needs reliable electricity and heat, constantly, you can use both the heat and the power generated by a fuel cell to offset greenohouse gases, and make the case for the efficiency for this technology.
We’ll be starting to track the data in September this year.”

[*Ed’s note: coal is generally regarded as one of the most polluting forms of energy, if one of the more affordable, in the U.S.]
According to Mike Upp, vice president of marketing at ClearEdge Power, his company currently has 225 full-time employees, has so far sold 100 fuel cell systems and is headquartered in Hillsboro, Oregon with plans to expand operations on the east coast this year.

9,"America's First Pipeline-Fed, Hydrogen Fueling Station Now Open In Los Angeles",https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/11/us-first-hydrogen-fueling-station/,2011/05/11," America’s first pipeline-fed, retail hydrogen fueling station opened in Torrance, California, within Los Angeles county on Tuesday. The station will provide hydrogen for fuel cell and hybrid vehicles in the area. It was built through a joint effort by Toyota, Air Products and Shell alternative energies, with funding from the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The station’s first customer was the owner of a Honda FCX Clarity.
A handful of hydrogen fuel cell black cabs have already hit the streets in London. Hydrogen fuel cell forklifts are already widely available, and used in warehouse fleets from Wal-Mart to Whole Foods. Fuel cell cars — promised by manufacturers including Toyota, Daimler, GM, Honda, and Hyundai — are not slated for mass market availability until 2015, though. The dominant clean vehicle technology available in the U.S. remains the battery electric vehicle.
Fuel cells cars are said to* produce no greenhouse gas emissions. In actuality, they produce H2O (water vapor is a greenhouse gas) and CO2 depending on the source of the hydrogen used. Most industrial hydrogen is produced from the reformation of hydrocarbons. [Ed’s note: Before publishing this post, I was unable to verify from Shell, Toyota or Air Products what the exact source of hydrogen was for this L.A. station, or how carbon intensive its production process might be.]
They have a 130- to 430-mile range (according to Toyota’s statements about its own fuel cell vehicles). Battery electric vehicles, so far, offer a much shorter range, and can only go up to 200 miles before recharging, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. On the other hand, battery electric vehicles can be charged at home, while fuel cell vehicles require special fueling stations at this point.
Among others, Honda is working on a “home energy station” for to generate hydrogen at home for fuel cells. A bevy of electric vehicle chargers are already on the market, however, including from Coulomb, Aerovironment and ECOtality.
As noted on the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) Fuel Cell Test and Evaluation Center (FCTec) website: Sir William Grove developed the first fuel cell in England in 1839, and in the 1950s, NASA and General Electric (GE) scientists developed the “Grubb-Niedrach fuel cell,” which became the first in the world to be used commercially.
Is the U.S. still leading the commercialization of fuel cells, globally? The executive director of the Fuel Cell & Hydrogen Energy Association (FCHEA), Ruth F. Cox, put things in perspective:


“There are somewhere around 600 [highway legal] fuel cell electric vehicles on the road, today. There are probably fewer than 50 different vehicle models in very limited production, now. That’s worldwide. We have about 150 of these vehicles [driving around] in the U.S.  We also have twenty some hydrogen fueling stations here, in California.
While the U.S. has led in terms of innovation, here, other countries have taken the lead in terms of building government and industry partnerships that bring together the oil and gas industry, alternative fueling companies, and the auto industry around an orchestrated plan for the deployment of infrastructure to support fuel cell vehicles.
Japan has made a commitment to deliver hundreds of refueling stations by 2015. Germany has committed to delivering thousands of stations by 2020.
As the technology matures, this will improve. Looking at battery electric vehicles, only thousands have been sold in the U.S. so far. It’s simply going to take some time.”

*The passage above was corrected and appended, May 11, 2011, 12:10 ET. A representative of the Fuel Cell & Hydrogen Energy Association referred to fuel cell vehicles as zero emissions vehicles in an interview. That statement was not meant literally, but I repeated the phrase in an earlier edition of this post. I’ve added details to clarify and maintain accuracy at the suggestion of commenter @Ben Kellie.

10,Alternative Energy: A Guide To Greening Your Home,https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/17/alternative-energy-a-guide-to-greening-your-home/,2010/08/17,"Alternative energy is a growing market, and though many states offer tax credits, rebates, and other incentives to promote clean energy, it can still prove to be an expensive proposition.
It generally also requires plugging your energy source into the grid so you’re not left in the dark when the wind calms or the sun lingers behind clouds.
Here is a roundup of solutions that can help power a home.
Solar
Solar is, in some ways, the easiest solution, or at least one of the most accessible. Plugging into the sun requires photovoltaic solar panels, an inverter, and batteries that can store a bit of any excess energy for a rainy day.
Performance varies regionally, of course, with states in the southern and southwestern regions enjoying the most days of sun per year.
Solar panels require little maintenance once installed and can provide large amounts of electricity in fair weather. It can be expensive, however, even with incentives, and even when hooked up to batteries, it doesn’t do much good when there’s no sun for stretches at a time.
Resources
GetSolar has a database for finding a solar installer in your area. It’s wise to compare quotes from several companies. Some installers prefer to install panels sold by their companies, while others will install any panels you purchase.
It’s also possible to rent solar panels. One of the largest renters is Citizenrē REnU, which offers 1, 5 or 25-year contracts that include installation.
Wind
Wind energy is often associated with mammoth wind farms, but smaller sized turbines are also produced for backyard energy production.
The speed of the wind is the determining factor in whether wind power is the right solution for your home. Weather services can tell you what the average wind speed in your region is, but it can vary within a region.
Not surprisingly, bigger turbines can produce larger amounts of energy. A 10-kilowatt turbine can usually provide enough energy for a house and is usually around 100 feet tall with a 23-foot turbine.
As with solar, wind energy is climate-dependent so when the turbine’s not turning, you might need a different energy source. Unlike solar, wind turbines have the added con of being built of out of moving parts that need regular maintenance.
Resources
A turbine large enough to power a home often requires a permit. The American Wind Energy Association offers a useful guide for going through the necessary steps to install your own turbine, as well as a list of wind gear providers.
If you’re low on space or looking for a plug-and-play solution, try a personal wind turbine like Southwest Windpower’s Air-X. It can produce up to 400 watts, enough to offset some lighting and appliance usage, and can be installed on top of a roof.
Alternatively, try Clarian’s Jellyfish When it hits the market next year, i will be able to provide the same potential wattage and also feature the ability to power your home by plugging into any standard wall outlet.
If you’re a do-it-yourselfer, find an old treadmill and take a stab at making your own as in this video:

Geothermal
Most geothermal energy is produced large scale, so single-home geothermal is usually limited to heating and cooling solutions. Still, considering how much energy indoor climate control can consume, geothermal heat pumps can significantly reduce your energy needs.
Geothermal heat pumps tap into the earth’s stable temperature to regulate that in your home. The pump moves heat from the earth to your home in winter and pulls the heat inside your house outside in summer.
Most pumps are built simply so they require little, if any maintenance, and  can be equipped with a household water heater as well.
Geothermal heat pumps are not a full-service solution, even for heating and cooling. Some models have been shown to reduce energy bills by up to 40%, which means you can’t say goodbye to your utility company and be completely comfortable indoors.
Cost is another concern. A heat pump with enough capacity to keep a home cozy averages just shy of $8,000, but the drilling required to install it can be upwards of $30,000.
Resources
Because of the amount and depth of drilling involved, geothermal heat pumps are not typically a do-it-yourself project. To find a reliable contractor, check the International Ground Source Heat Pump Association‘s directory of accredited installers to find one in your area.
Micro hydro electricity
This one only works if you live near moving water, but it can be very effective. Installation requires running a pipe from a high area where water is flowing to a lower piece of ground. Energy is produced as water moves downhill and turns a turbine at the end of the pipe.
Some micro hydro systems have been capable of producing ten or even 100 times more power than wind or solar. Unlike wind and solar, it can run non-stop and overnight, so long as the water continues to flow. An inverter and batteries can be connected to store extra energy if needed.
As with wind, the turbine requires maintenance and has the potential to break. Also, the size and pressure of the stream affects its energy production, so a very small stream might not be enough to power an entire house. Small streams also carry the risk of drying up in summer or freezing in cold weather.
Resources
You’ll probably need a contractor to install a micro hydro system. Many cities and states require anyone installing alternative energy sources to be a licensed electrician, especially if it connects to the grid. Although there isn’t a national licensing organization for micro hydro installers in the U.S., a local search should or call to your utility company should point you in the right direction.
Or, if you know what you’re doing and are as handy and patient as this guy, you can build your own micro hydro system.
Kössler, a joint venture between Siemens and Voith, makes several turbines designed for small power stations.
Energy Systems & Design also produces micro hydro equipment that can be used for a single home.
Fuel cells
Fuel cells use fuel and an oxidizing agent, typically hydrogen and oxygen, to produce heat and electricity. Inside the cell, he hydrogen’s ions and electrons are separated. An electrolyte substance inside the cell lets ions pass through but blocks electrons, which travel through a wire instead, in the form of electricity. The remaining ions turn into water or carbon dioxide when they meet with oxygen.
Resources
Bloom Energy‘s relatively new Bloom Box, which we reported on earlier this year, might be one of the most talked about home fuel cell solutions, though with its current price tag of $700,000-$800,000, it’s not exactly cheap.
Acumentrics manufactures fuel cells primarily for military use, but can also supply you with one for your home.
Most fuel cell companies don’t sell directly to the public, so you’ll have to search for an installer. FuelCellToday‘s directory can help you find one in your area.
The Department of Energy is working on developing best practices for safe hydrogen handling.
Biomass
Biomass for the home usually comes in the form of a stove used either for general home heating, or to heat water. Stoves are usually fueled by plants, including crops, trees, wood waste or grass. Biomass stoves do pollute the air, but many still consider them green because they contribute less pollution with fewer harmful chemicals than fossil fuels.

Those looking to buy a biofuel stove might try Bixby‘s MaxFire, which can be fueled with dry-shelled corn or wood pellets.
Bixby claims the stove can reduce heating costs by up to 50% and keep a typical home warm for about $1.50 per day. The stove ignites immediately with the push of a button and has eight heat level settings. When fuel is burned, the stove automatically pushes ash into a drawer that can be emptied without too much of a mess.
None of these solutions provide a fail-safe way to meet all your energy needs, but with blackouts from overburdened grids and severe weather conditions, neither do utility companies. It can be argued that some of these solutions are not entirely green, but even if they can’t completely alleviate the need for fossil fuels, they can help reduce the amount we need.
Most states offer incentives for alternative energy investments, and the Department of Energy suggests additional ways to lower usage and costs and lists products that are currently eligible for federal tax credits.
Despite state incentives, installing alternative energy is still an expensive proposition for most, but it can pay off in the long run.

12,Use a fuel cell to see how drunk you are this holiday season,https://techcrunch.com/2009/11/24/use-a-fuel-cell-to-see-how-drunk-you-are-this-holiday-season/,2009/11/24,"Worried that Uncle John might be hitting the Night Train a little too hard this holiday season? Well, now you can keep a closer eye on him, and avoid that lawsuit when he crashes into that parked cop car.
Sure, breathalyzer technology has been around for years. So have portable versions. This however, is the first portable breathalyzer that uses a fuel cell. See, the problem is that most breathalyzers use semiconductors to test for blood alcohol levels, however they are subject to false readings and have a short usage life.
The Lifeguard Breathalyzer is available online, for $299.95. Odds are you won’t have one before Thanksgiving, but maybe you can get one before the end of the December.

13,Dynario: Toshiba finally commercializes fuel cell for mobile devices,https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/22/dynario-toshiba-finally-commercializes-fuel-cell-for-mobile-devices/,2009/10/22,"
Toshiba has been announcing fuel cells for home use for ages now, but it seems the announcement [press release in English] they made today is really serious. The company has unveiled the Dynario today, a mini fuel cell that can charge mobile devices on the go. Japanese mobile gadget geeks can already order the fuel cell on Toshiba Japan’s online store (where it’s available exclusively).

Buyers get a methanol fuel cell that’s fairly large (size: 150x21x74.5mm), heavy (280g without fuel) and holds 14ml of fuel. Cartridges, which have to be bought separately, cost $32 for a set of five and hold 50ml each. The reaction between the methanol and ambient oxgyen triggers a chemical reaction, which then results in the production of electricity.

Shipping will start on October 29. The new technology comes at a high price though: Be ready to spend $320 for the fuel cell. Toshiba hasn’t said yet whether it will ever be sold outside Japan, but my guess is the company will see how sales go in Japan first.

Panasonic has on display at CEATEC a “1.5 kWh battery module [made] from 18650-type (18 mm in diameter x 65 mm in length) lithium-ion battery cells, which are widely used in laptop computers, to provide energy storage solutions for a wide range of environmentally friendly energy technologies.” String a couple of these suckers together to store the juice collected from the solar panels on your house, for example.

If solar power is to sissy for you, maybe you’d be interested in the Panasonic Fuel Cell Cogeneration System, which “generates electricity and hot water simultaneously at home”?

15,Toshiba makes those yet-to-be-commercialized mini fuel cells smaller,https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/06/toshiba-makes-those-yet-to-be-commercialized-mini-fuel-cells-smaller/,2009/10/06,"
Fuel cells, those electrochemical conversion devices, which are supposed to make the lives of gadget freaks easier, are still a hot topic in the alternative energy sector even though the technology hasn’t penetrated the mass market yet. Toshiba, for example, has been experimenting with fuel cells for quite some time now. And the company has now announced the development of a fuel-cell based cell phone that’s just 22mm thick.
The main achievement here is that this prototype is about 50% thinner than Toshiba’s previous one (which you see in the picture), marking another step towards commercialization in the future. The phone runs on methanol and doesn’t need to be charged.
This new prototype features a fuel cell that can be replaced with conventional lithium ion rechargeable batteries when needed (the earlier model ran on a non-detachable fuel cell). It can be filled with 3.5ml of methanol, which is enough for 320 hours of standby.
Toshiba has worked together with KDDI, Japan’s second biggest mobile phone carrier, in the development of the prototype. KDDI has already said it’s not yet ready to really sell fuel-cell-powered cell phone to end consumers, but this could change very soon. The companies already said they intend to push down the prototype phone’s thickness to 20mm or less, about the same as cell phones that are on the market right now.

Fuel cell technology is evolving at a rapid speed, it seems. In March, for example, Toshiba revealed plans to mass-produce portable fuel cells charging notebooks and phones. Now NGK Insulators, a company based in Nagoya, Japan, announced [JP] that it has developed the world’s most energy-efficient solid oxide fuel cell.
Fuel cells of this kind usually max out at energy efficiency rates of 55-60%, but NGK’s product is offering 63%. It’s able to continuously generate 700 watts at 800°C.
The new fuel cell is currently just a prototype, but NGK expects a commercial version by 2012 or 2013. The company says it will first target businesses, for example malls or convenience stores, possibly followed by a version for homes.

Hitachi seems to have made a major leap forward in the development of “green” vehicles. The company claims it has developed the world’s most efficient lithium-ion battery for hybrid cars, topping previous Hitachi batteries by an impressive 70% in output density.
The picture shows a lithium-ion battery module made by Hitachi last year (there is no picture of the new version available yet). The new battery boasts an output density of 4,500W. Hitachi plans to commercialize it by the middle of next year, along with a weaker (and probably cheaper) version that reaches only half of the power of the newest prototype.
Hitachi says the life span of the battery exceeds 10 years, which is 20% longer than that of the previous model. The company is the world’s first to mass-produce large li-ion batteries and has managed to sell 600,000 units since the year 2000.

Japanese companies NTT, Toho Gas and Sumitomo Precision Products have achieved a major leap forward in the production of efficient fuel cells. Their new and jointly developed fuel cell system [JP] boasts record-high efficiency (in the field of commercial applications, at least).
The system uses city gas as the source of hydrogen and houses a few dozens of flat fuel cells in a device so that no heat can escape. By 2012 at the latest, the system is planned to be sold to restaurants and convenience stores wanting to lower heating, cooling and lighting costs.
The system features a power output of 30kw and an energy efficiency of up to 59%. According to the companies involved in the development, buyers can expect the system to run for several thousand hours. This is how the current prototype performs, but the final version is supposed to boast an operating time of several tens of thousands of hours.

19,Toshiba to finally begin mass-producing portable fuel cells,https://techcrunch.com/2009/03/23/toshiba-to-finally-begin-mass-producing-portable-fuel-cells/,2009/03/23,"
Japan’s biggest newspaper, the Nikkei, is reporting that Toshiba is finally ready to roll out portable fuel cells for the mass market (as of this writing, Toshiba’s Japanese website doesn’t have any information on this yet). The company even announced a fuel-cell powered cell phone in October last year, but it doesn’t seem likely we get to see that handset by the end of this month (as promised by Toshiba).
Toshiba is the world’s first company that mass-produces fuel cells. Starting next month, a factory in Yokohama will turn out fuell cells that are based on methanol and can be used to charge cell phones or notebooks.
The fuel cells will cost between $100 and a whopping $500 at first, but Toshiba expects these prices to drop significantly after ramping up output. Toshiba mobile phones and notebooks with built-in fuel cells are now announced for the next fiscal year, which ends March 2010.
By fiscal 2015, the company expects to rake in $1 billion in sales of fuel cell-based products.

One of the prototype fuel cells presented by Hitachi as early as 2006
Hitachi announced today [JP] it has developed a methanol-based fuel cell, which is 45% smaller than the company’s existing fuel cells. Hitachi also claims its quieter and “greener” than power generators fueled by gas or diesel. The 100W prototype can generate power for about 1.5 hours on 0.45 liter of methanol.
The direct methanol fuel cell measures 32 x 21 x 22cm and will be tested together with the Center for Process Innovation, a research organization based in the UK. Trials will begin in February and last half a year. Hitachi says the portable fuel cell will be used to power surveillance cameras and road signs.
The company aims to commercialize the fuel cell in 2010 and plans to sell it as a replacement for conventional power generators and as a “green” power source for road signs.

22,Review: Medis 24/7 Power Pack fuel cell charger,https://techcrunch.com/2008/11/04/review-medis-247-power-pack-fuel-cell-charger/,2008/11/04,"

Short Version: The Medis 24/7 Power Pack makes for a good, easy-to-use emergency charging kit to keep in the car or for use anywhere without access to conventional power. At $30 to $50, it’s relatively inexpensive as long as you use it sparingly.


Overview and Features

Uses fuel cell technology: this isn’t a device that you need to initially charge in order to recharge something else. It’s got power built into it from the get-go. Conversely, once you’ve used up all the fuel, you’ll need to buy more (around $20).
Simple activation process ensures you don’t accidentally start using up juice until you need it.
Comes with USB, mini-USB, Motorola, and Nokia adapter tips. More are available.
Starts around $30. Replacement fuel costs around $20. Fuel is good for about 60-80 hours of music playback or 30 hours of cell phone talk time. So figure about five cell phone recharges to be on the safe side.
There’s also an “XTREME” version that sells for $50 and includes a rechargeable connector that plugs into the fuel cell pack for double-charging, effectively. The fuel cell charges the connector cable, which has a small battery inside of it. That cable connects to your devices and can charge them even when disconnected from the fuel cell.

It’s good for…
…emergency situations, like if you get stuck in a blizzard in your car for a couple days and need to recharge your cell phone to make emergency calls. It’s perfect for that. Also, camping and anywhere else that you might need to keep doodads powered up without access to conventional power. Charging time is quick, too. I was able to recharge the Samsung Rant from dead to full battery in under an hour and a half.
Not so good for…
…taking to the beach to keep your phone and/or iPod charged. Sure, you can use it for that but you’re basically spending about $3 to $5 each time you recharge one of your devices. Also, since the Power Pack contains liquid fuel, you’ll want to be careful about where you store it. The company recommends operating temperatures of between 32 and 104 degrees, so don’t leave it sitting on your dashboard all summer.
Shelf life could be an issue, too. Medis claims the Power Pack will last up to 18 months unopened and, once activated, the fuel is only good for up to three months.
Recommendation
The Medis 24/7 Power Pack is a great example of fuel cell technology finally making its way into consumers’ hands. Like all new-ish technologies it’s still a bit expensive for everyday use but as an emergency power source, the Power Pack is a great option.

23,Panasonic develops world's smallest notebook fuel cell,https://techcrunch.com/2008/10/20/panasonic-develops-worlds-smallest-notebook-fuel-cell/,2008/10/20,"
Panasonic today announced [JP] it developed the world’s smallest fuel cell for use in notebooks, reducing the size of its predecessor by 50%. The new model is sized at 270cc, which makes it as small as existing lithium ion batteries used in notebooks currently on the market.
Panasonic says the fuel cell will be positioned at the underside of notebooks and provides about 20 hours of power with 200cc of fuel. The prototype weighs just 320 grams. The fuel, highly concentrated methanol, can be stored in bottles.

Panasonic also developed a paperback-size fuel cell for use in cellular phones and other mobile devices. The company claims that this model is powerful enough to run portable TVs and that it can charge two devices at the same time. Weighing 350 grams, it measures 360cc.
Both products are to be commercialized in 2012. Panasonic will present the new technology to the general public during next week’s Hydrogen Energy Advanced Technology Exhibition [JP] in Chiba near Tokyo.

For the past two weeks hydrogen fuel cell cars have been lighting up the nation’s highways on a cross-country trip designed to showcase the emerging technology. This last weekend, they rolled into the Los Angeles Coliseum completing their trip that started in Portland, Maine.
Not only was the demonstration designed to be a positive reinforcement about the road-worthiness of the cars, but also to highlight the need for more fueling stations that can handle the cars. For long stretches the cars had to be hauled on flatbed trucks before they could refuel. There are about 60 refueling stations nationwide.
The tour stopped in 31 cities in 18 states. Catherine Dunwoody, executive director of the California Fuel Cell Partnership, said:

There’s a lot of curiosity about these vehicles. As we got to Allentown, Pennsylvania, people lined up and cheered.
Nine carmakers participated in the tour: Honda, GM, Toyota Motor Corp, Ford Motor Co, BMW AG, Daimler AG, Hyundai Motor Co, Nissan Motor Co, and Volkswagen AG.

Yamaha is set to debut a new pseudo-125cc fuel cell-powered scooter at this week’s International Battery, Hybrid and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle Symposium & Exposition in Yokohama. The scooter has a secondary Lithium Ion battery that charges from the main Hydrogen fuel cell.
If Yamaha puts the little bike into production, it would be the first mass-produced fuel cell vehicle on the planet. Currently, Fuel Cell technology is not efficient enough for full-sized automobiles, but by proving the technology can work at a slightly smaller scale, that could change.
Now all we need is some Hydrogen-powered motorcycles for some full on Nerdrophenia Tom-Foolery, with soundtrack courtesy of The Who.
