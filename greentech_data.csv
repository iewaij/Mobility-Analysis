0,Daimler’s new electric heavy-duty truck has 220 miles of range,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/25/daimlers-new-electric-heavy-duty-truck-has-220-miles-of-range/,2017/10/25,"
Daimler has a new all-electric semi truck that it revealed at this year’s Tokyo Motor Show, with a range of around 220 miles on a single charge and a heavy-duty towing capacity of around 11 tons, or just two tons less than its diesel equivalent.
The Vision One packs in batteries with storage capacity of up to 300 kilowatt hours, and that 220 miles of range allow for short haul trips between relatively closely spaced cities – not suitable for long haul, of focuses, but more flexible in terms of carrying large loads over medium distances.
The E-FUSO brand is also a new sub-brand of Daimler’s Mitsubishi trucking unit, which will lie alongside FUSO but focus on its all-electric ambitions and aim of delivering a purely electric version of all the trucks across its range. Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus co. notes that it’s the first vehicle maker of its kind to have a brand dedicated to EV buses and trucks.
This truck debut comes after FUSO has started to deploy its eCanter light duty truck to its first commercial customers, and just ahead of the debut of a Tesla’s electric heavy-duty transport truck, which is set to be unveiled next month at a special event.
Tesla’s truck is reported to have a range of between 200 and 300 miles, which could put it right tin line with the new E-FUSO Vision One. This is definitely a shot across the bow of Tesla’s trucking ambitions, though we’ll have to see what Elon Musk’s company will be demonstrating in terms of additional features, including perhaps autonomous capabilities, that it thinks will set its offering apart.

1,Nissan’s IMx electric concept car wants to get to know you,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/25/nissans-imx-concept-electric-concept-car-wants-to-get-to-know-you/,2017/10/25,"
Nissan’s latest electric vehicle concept aims for crossover appeal, with a design that goes well beyond the Nissan Leaf in terms of aggressive styling and visual appeal. The IMx also focuses on self-driving technologies, and on learning a user’s preferences and providing them with a wraparound informatics display that incorporates its learnings about its user.
The IMx design has been conceived to communicate its electric underpinnings on the outside, and it’s a look that was conceived based on taking inspiration from Japanese swords, and also from ‘washi,’ or Japanese paper that’s made for subtly and durability with a painstaking multi-step creation process.

It’s definitely an attractive car, with a full glass roof and sleek narrow headlights, and an interior with wood trim that lend to the sense of open interior space made possible by the extra room made available through use of the electric drivetrain. The suicide doors and lack of a B pillar further add to that sense of expansive, usable space.

The Nissan IMx also has a range of smart features on board, including the ability to engage Nissan’s self-driving ProPILOT system, which takes over driving duties. This includes some neat additional features like a retracting steering wheel and brake and gas pedal, which descend into the dashboard and the floor respectively to provide more room for the driver to relax comfortably.

Nissan’s latest concept car also features a wraparound display that provides live information around the driver and passengers in the cockpit, just below the windshield and passenger windows. The screen will provide info like navigation data, as well as suggestions about what they might like to do, extrapolating that information based on past trip data.
Nissan told me that it’s working with partners on its in-vehicle smart assistant, but it wouldn’t articulate which partners it’s using specifically. It also hinted that the assistant might be able to follow the driver beyond the vehicle throughout their daily life.

The car’s interface use cameras placed throughout the vehicle and artificial intelligence to interpret user commands and anticipate their needs, with the intend of minimizing manual controls and other potential distractions.
Nissan says that while this is just a concept, it’s still intended to reflect the actual direction of their efforts around ‘Intelligent Mobility’ and its productization.

2,Toyota sees traditional gas engines phased out of its line by the 2040s,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/25/toyota-sees-traditional-gas-engines-phased-out-of-its-line-by-the-2040s/,2017/10/25,"
Toyota sees dedicated gas and diesel engines in its vehicles lineup reducing to zero by the 2040s, on its path to its goal of reducing the CO2 emissions of its vehicles by 90 percent by 2050 (compared to 2010). At a press conference hosted by the company at the 2017 Tokyo Motor Show today, Toyota’s Chief Safety Technology Officer Kiyotaka Ise noted that this is their anticipated time frame for ending the production of gas and diesel cars.
The timeline is close to the target dates mentioned by some other companies, and matches up with the ban targets set by a number of countries, including France and the U.K., with China also announcing plans to set a timeline for the end of purely internal combustion engine vehicles.
This doesn’t mean that Toyota will sell only electric vehicles from the 2040s on — the company has been one of the slowest movers among automakers when it comes to building purely electric cars, and it has repeatedly said that it believes the best strategy is to embrace a range of powertrain options, including fuel cell and hybrid vehicles, to suit the needs of different markets around the world.
Internal combustion tech will still be used from the 2040s on, Ise said, via hybrid engines, but the use of purely ICE drivetrains won’t make sense after this date given the company’s aggressive emissions targets and the progress of its technology in hybrid powertrain options.

3,"As electric vehicles make a move to the mainstream, utilities are taking notice",https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/25/as-electric-vehicles-make-a-move-to-the-mainstream-utilities-are-taking-notice/,2017/10/25,"
In a move highlighting the growing importance of electric charging stations to utilities, Italian power giant Enel has bought a small, fast-growing California developer of charging stations and power management software.
Through its EnerNOC subsidiary, Enel acquired San Carlos, Calif.-based Electric Motor Werks for an undisclosed amount, in a transaction that could be a harbinger of things to come for a new generation of grid storage and power management software companies.
“Electric vehicles have the potential to be one of the most disruptive technologies the modern electricity grid has faced in the last one hundred years,” said Francesco Venturini, head of Enel’s Global e-Solutions division, in a statement. “The electric mobility revolution is leading utilities, grid operators, and consumers to rethink traditional business models, invest in new infrastructure, and roll out new solutions to provide flexibility and resiliency to the grid.”
Driving the acquisition is a flurry of news over the past few months as carmakers have committed to moving their fleets to full or hybrid-electric drive trains.
In fact, Volvo and Jaguar Land Rover have gone so far as to say that their entire fleets of vehicles will be electric or hybrid-electric by 2019 and 2020, respectively.
The road to this electric vehicle future is being paved by announcements from some of the world’s biggest economies of their intention to ban the sale of diesel and gasoline cars. So far, France and England are looking at a ban on combustion engines by 2040, while India and China, the world’s most populous nations, are also planning a ban on gas vehicles within the next 20 years.
Utilities are responding to the changing nature of vehicle fleets and the fuel that will power them. In fact, in this year alone, utilities in California have proposed over $1 billion for residential and commercial charging networks for electric vehicles.
With eMotorWerks, Enel gets a developer of charging technologies, which also acts as a white-label supplier of charging technologies, as well as a software solution for managing power and distributing it across a grid.
Through partners like Clipper Creek, AeroVironment and Volta Charging, and its own charging station sales, eMotorWerks has deployed roughly 25,000 systems, according to the company’s chief executive Val Miftakhov.
What differentiates eMotorWerks from other charging companies like EvGo, which was acquired by the private equity firm Vision Ridge last year, is its focus on residential — rather than commercial — charging stations.
By buying eMotorWerks, Enel picks up more than just a network of home chargers. It also gets a power management and load balancing system. Through the actual installed chargers that eMotorWerks manages it has access to roughly 10 megawatts of storage at peak power times available for sale to utilities as they need them, according to Miftakhov.
The power management software that the company has developed allows it to manage when cars on its network will recharge… meaning that it can act as a load balancer for utilities, drawing down power from renewable sources when demand is lower, and feeding power into the grid for load management during demand spikes.
“The California grid is divided into zones and each of the zones has its own pricing,” says Miftakhov. “We organize our energy groups by zones, categorize the load and use the information to go back to the grid operator and tell the utility about flexible capacity and we can use that to balance the grid.”
Issues of power management and control will be critical as more electric vehicles are added to the grid.
“[As] EV adoption grows, utilities must either add more infrastructure to meet energy demands or adopt smart-charging solutions,” said Miftakhov. “eMotorWerks’ solution minimizes EV emissions and remotely optimizes charging load, which can reduce peak demands and increase the likelihood that EVs charge on cheaper and cleaner renewable energy.”
Indeed, recent reports indicate that local distribution points may not be able to stand up to the increases in energy demand without some sort of power management system.
A report from FleetCarma, a logistics and networked fleet management technology developer, outlined the breadth of the problem. Typically, electric vehicles require the same amount of power as a small household to make a roughly 30-mile round trip. That puts a lot of stress on transformers, which manage the distribution of power among neighborhoods.
According to the FleetCarma report:

Some studies suggest that higher penetration rate of electric vehicles increase transformers’ loss-of-life factor, even by up to 10,000 times. And this comes with a hefty price tag. The Sacramento Municipality Utility District, for example, has recognized that about 17% of the company’s transformers may need to be replaced as a result of EV-related overloads, at an average estimated cost of $7,400 per transformer.
There are some attempts made to help the utilities plan ahead and avoid serious and long-term degradation of electricity reliability. California and Texas, for example, are considering notification systems that inform power companies when a citizen buys an electric car in their service area. Other jurisdictions may follow suit.

While adoption of electric vehicles is strongest in California, where a combination of subsidies and ample charging stations make owning an electric vehicle simple, utilities in the Midwest and East Coast are also plotting for their electric vehicle future.
Two years ago, Kansas City Power & Light adopted a $20 million electric vehicle charging program that made the utility’s region an EV mecca. And earlier in October, Virginia joined the EV powertrain with its own plans to issue a request for proposals for its own electric vehicle charging network.
“There’s a little movement afoot here in the middle of flyover country,” Chuck Caisley, KCP&L’s vice president for marketing and public affairs told NPR a few months ago. “We’re awfully excited about the prospect of this kind of transportation, and so we wanted to be catalytic to that.”
As Bloomberg’s Gadfly notes, utilities should be ecstatic about the prospect. If the world goes to electric, that means as much as 20 percent growth in demand for power.

Let’s just take light-duty vehicles with a short wheel base (not heavy trucks or buses), of which there were about 190 million on the road in 2015, according to government figures. For the sake of simplicity, replace them all with a full battery-electric vehicle that gets 3.5 miles per kilowatt-hour, loses 10 percent of the power it takes as it charges and discharges, and travels 13,000 miles a year.
Presto! You’ve basically created an entirely new center of demand for power rivaling the entire industrial sector of the U.S.

Enel certainly thinks the highways of the future will be traversed by EVs and that the company’s future in part depends on it.
“Our mission is to be on the cutting edge of this paradigm shift, where consumers can play a more active role in energy generation and use,” says Venturini. “This acquisition enriches our e-mobility offering and integrates a highly sophisticated smart EV charging solution within our portfolio of grid flexibility services, which includes the world’s largest demand response network, distributed energy management systems and battery storage solutions.”

4,Tesla makes quick work of Puerto Rico hospital solar power relief project,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/24/tesla-makes-quick-work-of-puerto-rico-hospital-solar-power-relief-project/,2017/10/24,"
Tesla CEO Elon Musk noted on Twitter that Tesla’s solar team could indeed outfit Puerto Rico with power facilities that could be used to generate and store power reserves when the existing grid isn’t available, as it has been after the U.S. territory faced the devastation of hurricane Maria. Now, Tesla is showing that it’s making good on its promise of help, with significant progress being made on one solar generation/storage facility on the island.


Hospital del Niño is first of many solar+storage projects going live. Grateful to support the recovery of Puerto Rico with @ricardorossello pic.twitter.com/JfAu11UBYg
— Tesla (@Tesla) October 24, 2017



The facility in question will provide power to Hospital del Niño, with a combination of solar cells and Tesla’s Powerpack commercial energy storage batteries. That should mean it can not only generate power from the sun’s rays in times of need, but also store up a reserve that can be used to provide power around the clock and throughout varying weather conditions, even when the sun isn’t shining.
Tesla noted on Twitter that this is just the “first of many solar+storage projects going live,” after the company discussed how it might help with Puerto Rico’s ongoing recovery efforts with PR Governor Ricardo Rossello following an exchange between the Governor and Musk on Twitter. Rossello and Puerto Rican Chief Innovation Officer Glorimar Ripoli proposed turning the territory into a flagship example of what Tesla’s solar technologies can do for the world.
Tesla has also been shipping its home Powerwall battery storage units to the island for help restoring the grid, and Musk himself donated $250,000 of his personal money to support relief efforts. Tesla also postponed its electric semi truck reveal event to November in order to focus on helping establish facilities like this one in Puerto Rico.

5,Singapore to cap number of cars allowed on roads from 2018,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/23/singapore-to-cap-number-of-cars-allowed-on-roads-from-2018/,2017/10/23,"
Cars congesting roads is a problem in just about every major urban center around the world, but some areas are worst in this regard than others. Singapore is one of those, and it’s going to do something about it – the government there has announced that it will cut the annual growth rate of cars and motorcycles allowed on roads in the country from 0.25 percent to zero starting next February.
The zero growth rate is something that Singapore essentially has to do – it spans a smaller total area than New York City, as Bloomberg notes, and yet it has given over 12 percent of its total land area to roads thus far. The decision to cap new cars on the road is due to there just not being enough land for more road expansion.
This new cap doesn’t apply to transport vehicles for goods and buses, which will continue to be able to grow at 0.25 percent per year through at least 2021. It’ll also revisit the cap for all vehicles in 2025.
Singapore isn’t alone in facing the challenge of there just being too many cars on the road, and too many demands on infrastructure as a result. But it is a particularly poignant example of what happens when that reaches a crisis point, and a good sample case to look to to see why there’s such a focus on mobility services and alternative transportation services particularly for dense urban environments.

Toyota is debuting a new concept vehicle for the forthcoming Tokyo Motor Show, and it’s a fuel cell vehicle that’s designed to get around 1,000 km (around 621 miles) on a single hydrogen pack that can be refuelled in about 3 minutes total. The concept looks like an aggressively future-styled minivan, though it’s billed as a “premium saloon,” and it’s got an interior design that emphasizes second row seating space.
The Fine-Comfort Ride is designed to be flexible in its seat configuration, so that it can use used maximally by just one occupant, or rather as a meeting or communication and collaboration room for a group.

It’s also got a virtual Agent built into touch displays on the driver and passenger windows and screens, for a full surround infotainment experience. The motors are in the wheels, positioned at the absolute outside edges of the car, too, which Toyota says makes for silent running and quite operation.
There are also no dividing pillars separating the front and rear seats, and the bucket seating looks like lounge furnishings from a Blade Runner movie. It’s actually a super cool vision of future mobility, albeit probably not a particularly realistic one.
Toyota should have plenty more to show off at the Tokyo Motor Show next week, so stay tuned for more big reveals, and hopefully more far-out concepts.

7,London puts new hybrid electric black cabs on roads ahead of larger rollout,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/18/london-puts-new-hybrid-electric-black-cabs-on-roads-ahead-of-larger-rollout/,2017/10/18,"
London is staring up a pilot test of its electric black cabs (via Engadget), otherwise known as the TX5, after first revealing the vehicles back in 2015. The cars have 70 miles of pure EV range on their built-in battery pack, but can also go up to 400 miles using the onboard gas engine to generate the power for the battery and motor.
The vehicles meet the conditions for London’s forthcoming requirement that all new taxis on roads be technically “zero emission capable” as of the start of January, 2018. The taxis also feature a number of onboard convenience features and other tech add-ons, including built-in Wi-Fi, USB chargers, a panoramic roof and six seats, plus contactless terminals for accepting tap cards and mobile payments.
This is still a car that will probably spend a lot of time guzzling gas, considering its range and the amount of travel that drivers normally do during a day in the city. But it’s a far greener alternative compared to what’s used now, and it has the potential to get better over time.

8,Amazon patents a drone that delivers a charge to power up EVs on the go,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/17/amazon-patents-a-drone-that-delivers-a-charge-to-power-up-evs-on-the-go/,2017/10/17,"
A recent Amazon patent could be an answer to range anxiety, albeit one that sounds a bit more sci-fi than practical solution at the moment: the newly granted patent (via Roadshow) describes a drone that could carry a battery charge for electric cars, and deliver them to any cars out on the road that need them while in route, providing enough juice to get to a proper charging station.
There’s a lot that seems crazy about this patent, however – including the fact that drones themselves require a lot of tricky power management to get even limited flight times with lightweight cargo on board. Keeping themselves charged and within range of vehicles in need of a top-up might be the most challenging aspect of the idea overall, in fact.
It’s not the only hurdle in terms of making this thing real, either; the patent also describes a rooftop docking station that the drone can land on to stay connected with the vehicle and provide power on an ongoing basis while it continues along its route. That means either aftermarket modifications or buy-in from automakers will be required to make it happen, too.
At the moment, it’s not a super realistic concept, in other words. But it has potential, especially if we get to a future where EVs are commonplace, as are drone delivery services (something Amazon definitely is interested in making happen).

LG is opening Europe’s largest factory for building lithium-ion batteries destined for use in electric cars, the company announced. Its LG Chem division is going to open the doors for the facility in 2019 in Poland near Wroclaw, per Reuters, and the facility will be able to supply as many as 100,000 EV batteries per year beginning next year.
For comparison, Panasonic’s latest battery facility in China can make enough to supply the production of around 200,000 vehicles per year, and the Gigafactory hopes to eventually produce enough for around 500,000 vehicles per year. The Gigafactory at its current capacity, which is nowhere near total eventual output, is producing more batteries than any other factory in the world, according to Elon Musk.
Battery production could become a major choke point for vehicle electrification as more automakers shift more of their model lineups to EVs and hybrids. More factories can definitely help, but supply of base materials could become an even bigger hindrance in the future.

Toyota has hydrogen fuel cell transport trucks that generate no local emissions, and that have 670 horsepower and an 80,000-pound total weight capacity. The powertrain includes two of Toyota’s Mirai fuel cells, and a 12kWh battery charged by the cells. Toyota is now running a concept version of the truck along pilot routes that run around 200 miles per day, moving goods between depots in the Port of LA and Long Beach.
The pilot is designed to help Toyota see what the impact of frequent cycling of its fuel cell system will do to the packs, as they’ll be refueled often to run the short-haul trips. Over time, Toyota plans to conduct longer runs of the truck as well, as part of the overall feasibility study that is also part of the Port of LA’s long-term plans to reduce emissions overall.
Hybrid electric trucking tech is seen by some as the most viable option for long-haul transport while also reducing emissions, as it doesn’t compromise on range while producing zero local waste. Startup Nikola is working on building its own heavy-duty hydrogen electric hybrid hauler, for instance, and many existing truck makers are also exploring hybrid drivetrain options.
Tesla plans to unveil its own fully electric semi truck in November, and Tesla founder Elon Musk has been a vocal critic of hydrogen power in general. Tesla’s truck is rumored to have 200 to 300 miles of range, which could work well for this type of application, coincidentally, but wouldn’t serve the needs of longer hauls (short of changing out the cab at multiple stops along the way).

At Nvidia’s GTC Europe conference today, one of the company’s partners detailed plans to bring an autonomous delivery fleet to operating status starting in 2018. Deutsche Post DHL Group wants to put trucks on the road in partnership with auto supplier ZF by that time frame, using electric light transport vehicles equipped with ZF’s Nvidia-based ProAI self-driving system.
DPDHL will help make this happen staring now, by equipping its fleet of 3,400 electric delivery StreetScooter vehicles with ZF sensors, including video cameras, as well as LiDAR and radar. The data gathered by these vehicles will help inform ZF’s ProAI self-driving system, teaching the AI to be able to navigate itself along the delivery routes handled by DPDHL once its autonomous trucks are ready to come to market.
In addition to the Nvidia-powered ZF ProAI self-driving tech, which uses Nvidia’s Drive PX AI computers, DPDHL is also using Nvidia’s DGX-1 AI supercomputer in its data center to train the neural networks that will prove the basis for its future autonomous delivery fleet.
Nvidia and DPDHL unveiled the prototype electric light delivery vehicle at GTC Europe today, equipped with six cameras, plus two LiDAR sensors and a radar array.

Puerto Rico’s power grid has been practically demolished in the wake of hurricane Maria. It now has a once in a lifetime opportunity to rebuild and the island’s governor Ricardo Rossello wants to have a chat with Elon Musk about his recent offer to use Tesla batteries and solar power for the the job.
Only 10 percent of the island has power at the moment and, according to the Puerto Rico state-owned electric company, some communities won’t be able to turn the lights back on for four to six months.
Musk tweeted yesterday he could be the one to rebuild Puerto Rico’s electricity system using independent batteries and solar power.
“The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too,” Musk wrote.


The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world, but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too. Such a decision would be in the hands of the PR govt, PUC, any commercial stakeholders and, most importantly, the people of PR.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 5, 2017



Governor Rossello tweeted at Musk shortly after with, “Let’s talk. Do you want to show the world the power and scalability of your #TeslaTechnologies? PR could be that flagship project.”


As the Government’s CINO, I fully support this! Let’s build the Puerto Rico we all want through innovation #letstalk @prstateits
— Glorimar Ripoll (@prstatecino) October 6, 2017



Puerto Rico’s chief innovation officer Glorimar Ripoli is also on board. “As the Government’s CINO, I fully support this! Let’s build the Puerto Rico we all want through innovation,” she tweeted.
The real question is if this talking will turn into action.
Tesla has already shipped hundreds of its Powerwall battery systems to Puerto Rico and Tesla employees are currently busy installing them and training locals how to continue the process.
Musk also has a history of turning Twitter chats into something more. He struck a deal to build a battery plant in South Australia based on a tweet with Atlassian founder and Australian Mike Cannon-Brookes last March. Musk broke ground on the deal last month and stands to lose $50 million if he doesn’t complete the job within 100 days.
As Musk mentioned in his tweet, Tesla has created a battery and solar power grid for other islands, like the Kauaʻi Island Utility Cooperative in Hawaii and in American Samoa.
Of course, those projects were for much smaller populations than Puerto Rico. But Musk seems confident his system can scale to meet the demands of the island’s 3.4 million citizens.

13,The new electric utilities,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/05/the-new-electric-utilities/,2017/10/05,"




Stonly Baptiste
Contributor



Stonly Baptiste is a co-founder and partner with the investment firm Urban.us, the venture fund for startups that make cities and the environment better.


An ideal electric utility costs less, is good for the planet and reduces the chances of losing power completely. And it doesn’t ask us to give up creature comforts like AC. 
New utilities are enabled by new technologies and business models, not fuels. 
Consumers want renewables
Almost two-thirds of Americans want renewables to be prioritized. As Aoi Senju points out, this desire transcends party politics and climate denial. But this doesn’t mean consumers want to pay more.  
Zero fuel costs
Solar (and wind) power have made rapid progress against other energy options. Solar, and to a lesser extent, wind have benefited from rapid technological improvements and no-operating cost energy sources. In contrast, fossil fuel development is constrained by stable or increasing prices and the fact that technological improvements are made very costly and difficult by ever-harder extraction challenges.

While solar is seeing a rapid reduction in costs, a critical issue remains — when the sun is out, people tend to use less energy. The chart below illustrates the challenge in California. 

A few different approaches to address this problem are starting to get traction. First, batteries can help. Some of the power generated during the day can be stored and then used at night. 
Second, homes have many connected energy devices such as thermostats and hot water heaters. These can be adjusted to reduce peaks or to shift some of their activities to times when sunshine is abundant. 
Fleets of batteries
Startups like Swell Energy are building out battery fleets among residential homeowners, and in doing so are creating a new category of behind-the-meter, virtual energy providers. Swell Energy is at the hub of the residential energy market and bridges the gap between utilities, installers, manufacturers and the consumer.  
The company sells and leases batteries to homeowners and then aggregates the batteries to provide additional value to utilities. Swell Energy contracts directly with utilities like Southern California Edison with whom they are building the largest residential virtual power plant to date, a network of 3,000 homes with home batteries and solar that will help SCE reduce peak demand.
Utility contracts enable Swell Energy to provide leases to customers at more competitive rates than other providers. Utilities benefit by reducing their load and not needing to purchase expensive electricity during peak hours. By benefiting from the local and distributed nature of battery fleets, utilities also can forgo expensive infrastructure investments.
But what about the benefits to consumers? Batteries enable cheaper, more reliable power for homeowners and are the ideal companion for solar, allowing consumers to store energy for use at night. The dispatchable nature of energy storage allows consumers to store energy from the grid when it is cheapest in the day and use this stored electricity when the rates are most expensive.
There also is value in having the ability to be independent from the grid, particularly during an outage. 
Energy independence
Hurricane Irma provided a timely case study on energy independence. 
“People need to be prepared for extended outages — weeks,” commented an FPL representative on the expected duration of power outages in Florida following the hurricane. 
In contrast to the grid, cellular services continued to function throughout the hurricane because cellular network operators have installed batteries and generators for their equipment. They learned a tough lesson during Hurricane Katrina, when 70 percent of the network went offline. 
Power outages cause new problems. Without backup power, smart homes become dumb or at least less smart as connected devices shut down. Grid failure also impacts EVs such as cars and rideables. 
Home battery storage offers a new layer of security for homeowners who want to avoid prolonged outages.  
Backup systems aren’t new, but their market penetration is relatively small. In part, this may be because leasing is typically not available to residential customers, so this appliance looks like an AC purchase. 
Batteries will replace fuel-powered systems, especially in sunnier spots, because they’re already competitive on cost (backup generator costs are higher than grid power). But they’re also easier to maintain — no moving parts means no servicing.

Robot energy agents
Startups like Virtual Peaker are using existing installed devices to change customer demand. 
The goal is to allow utilities to reduce demand by making adjustments to various devices in consumers’ homes. Today this means applications like AC or water heating, but will also grow to include electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. 
The challenge is how to cut demand without causing discomfort or inconvenience. Virtual Peaker is using machine learning to study behaviors in order to make adjustments that shouldn’t be noticeable to customers, but will have very positive impacts for utilities. 
Programs like this are not new, but so far have been approached via individual devices like smart thermostats. Working with multiple different devices across applications increases the size of the demand reduction that utilities can achieve. 
Another approach to energy agents is focused more on interactions with the grid. Grid+ represents consumer interests by buying and selling energy on their behalf. For example, if there is excess energy and the price is right, energy can be traded, but if not it can be stored. This is an “asset-light” way to organize distributed energy assets like battery fleets where each interested party buys or sells resources based on prevailing conditions. 
New rewards & incentives
Incentives are not new. Utilities have offered consumer incentives to everything from more efficient window installations to demand-response incentives to cut high demand from ACs in the summer. 
Platforms like Solarcoin make it quite easy to offer incentives. In fact they offer a coin-based currency for any verified production of solar. Solarcoins are already being used in transactions to receive discounts from solar installers, for example. No doubt the platform might be co-opted by governments and utilities, but if the value of Solarcoin increases, this won’t be necessary. 
Free energy? 
Energy cost curves point to steadily declining costs because we’re gradually removing fuel costs. But can energy be free? 
Amazon Dash buttons were intended to help with reordering. But why push a button when your dishwasher can tell Amazon you’re running low? 
It’s not necessary to upgrade your dishwasher. This is where disaggregation comes in. Disaggregation uses algorithms to look at how you use energy. From this data, the algorithms can tell which appliances or devices are in use. 
No, disaggregation isn’t new, but could energy data be used to do more than simply offering consumers a view of how their appliances are using energy? 
Fresh Energy is pioneering the use of disaggregated data to offer new services to customers. For example, data about dishwasher usage might be sold to a vendor of dishwasher soap, or perhaps Amazon, so that the soap supply can be replenished. 
In this way, various brands might subsidize your energy use, in return for ongoing access to your usage data. 
From rate payer to customer
Utilities have built vast infrastructures funded by investors who bet on their ability to collect payments much like governments collect taxes. 
But this deal makes less and less sense for consumers. Consumers are increasingly able to get the same electrons but at a reduced impact on their wallets, not to mention on the climate. And they’re able to take out an insurance policy against being without these electrons altogether.

14,Boeing to acquire Aurora Flight Sciences in bet on autonomous flight,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/05/boeing-to-acquire-aurora-flight-sciences-in-bet-on-autonomous-flight/,2017/10/05,"
Boeing is acquiring Aurora Flight Sciences, a company that focuses on autonomous flight systems designed to make robot aircraft and vehicles a reality. Boeing says that its acquisition of Aurora will help it push forward its efforts around self-flying vehicle development, for both military and commercial use.
Aurora Flight Sciences has been developing its LightningStrike XV-24A vertical take-off and landing craft, an autonomous military aircraft that is being funded by DARPA and the USAF. Earlier this year, Aurora ran a successful test flight program for its XV-24A Demonstrator, a subscale version of the eventual production vehicle.
Once the acquisition goes through, Aurora will continue to operate as its own independent subsidiary of Boeing, and will continue its work on designing and producing autonomous aircraft. In addition to the XV-24A, Aurora has designed and flown over 30 pilot-free vehicles during its nearly 20 years in operation.
Boeing isn’t the only major aerospace company making big bets on VTOLs – Airbus revealed this week that it’s still on track to start testing its first electric flying cars beginning next year, on a path to what it hopes will eventually be deploying of autonomous aerial taxi vehicles.

Airbus is looking to put its flying taxi in the air next year, confirmed CityAirbus chief engineer Marius Bebesel this week. The schedule is on track after CityAirbus conducted successful ground tests of the electric power system it’s using to propel the vehicle through the air.
The CityAirbus craft is a vertical take-off and landing craft that uses a four rotor design, and that would be able to take up to four passengers on short flights in dense urban areas, with the aim of connecting major transportation hubs including train stations and airports. It’s designed to be pilot operated at launch, but to eventually transition to being a fully autonomous vehicle once the tech catches up.

CNBC reports that Airbus is aiming to operate the craft along fixed, predetermined routes, with top air speeds of around 80 mph. They’ll be able to skip over the traffic that can dramatically increase travel times entering and exiting busy city transit points, which would theoretically also help alleviate ground congestion.
Short hop flights are also an ideal application of battery electric tech, since that’s all that vehicles will be able to manage using fully electric power sources in the near-term. Plus, battery unit swapping or autonomous dock charging could help make it easier to make these vehicles fully self-flying in the future.

16,How Zunum Aero’s hybrid-electric planes aim to transform flight starting in 2022,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/05/how-zunum-aeros-hybrid-electric-planes-aim-to-transform-flight-starting-in-2022/,2017/10/05,"
Consumer passenger flight could be the next industry that’s transformed by electric powertrains, and Seattle’s Zunum Aero wants to be at the forefront of that change.
The Seattle-based company, which is backed by Boeing’s HorizonX fund and Jet Blue’s Technology Ventures, has a plan to change the fundamental economics of regional flight, and shift the economics of air travel on a path towards eventual fully electric flight.
Zunum Aero’s plan to make this happen starts with its first launch aircraft, a vehicle it revealed in full detail today, after sharing some information earlier this year. The first Zunum aircraft is designed for regional service, with seating for 12 passengers and a delivery window starting in 2022. The economics are potentially game-changing, with operating expenses of around $260 per hour for the aircraft.
With a max cruise stepped of 340 miles per hour in the air, a take-off distance of 2,200 feet, a total hybrid-electric range of 700 miles (which it hopes to scale to over 1,000 in time) and 80 percent lower noise and emissions vs. traditional regional planes, Zunum is position its airplane as the perfect way to light up under-utilized regional airports across the U.S., providing affordable and efficient commuter flights where economic realities have made running regular service impractical.
“In the past, very intentionally, we were quiet about operating costs, because it’s just shockingly low what you can get with an electric. So that you can get an aircraft of a size that could never compete with an airliner that can get you below commercial fares,” Zunum Aero CEO Ashish Kumar told me in an interview. He put the cost per seat operating expenses at around 8 cents per mile. “That’s about one-tenth the operating cost of a business jet per hour,” he said.

Kumar showed me a map of over 5,000 airports in the U.S. that are currently operating far under capacity, and explained that Zunum’s goal is to change the face of air transport by maximizing the efficacy of this existing infrastructure.
The Zunum airframe is designed to work with the runways and airports that are already in place, he explained, and they won’t even require significant fuelling or charging overhauls thanks to the hybrid design. Their airframe is also designed to be easy for existing commercial pilots to get qualified on and use.
Over time, the Zunum Aero craft (which should have the same operable cycle limit as current commercial airplanes) is also designed to be adaptable to changing power source options: Zunum officially calls it a “hybrid-to-electric” aircraft, and it’s designed so that its onboard fuel tank can eventually be reduced in size and replaced with additional battery units, so that as battery tech improves, it could transition to a fully electric aircraft – even without having to invest in a new generation airframe.
But what about the benefit to consumer? Kumar says that travel times could be dramatically reduced, turning the current 4 hour, 50 minute door-to-door trip to Washington, DC from Boston to a 2 hour, 30 minute trip, for instance. Plus, there’d be cost savings too, with a fare for that journey likely going for around $140, or about a third less than current commercial pricing.
In California, a San Jose to LA flight could take just 2 hours and 15 minutes, door-to-door, rather than the average 4 hours and 40 minutes currently required. Pricing would be around $120 based on estimates, which would again be under the average current ticket fare.

Reducing those times is about more than just time spent in the air, since commercial jets actually fly at higher speeds in many cases. Instead, it’s about reducing congestion at airports around major hubs, and redistributing regional flights away from jammed international facilities with enhanced security and longer check-in times, and about providing flights near to where consumers are living, rather than requiring a lengthy trip to the nearest major airport first.
“You have a business jet type travel experience, you walk on and off, perhaps without any security, you get to places a whole lot faster because you’re flying out of small airfield, and you’re not paying more than commercial economy,” Kumar said.
Zunum Aero’s plan is to aim for flight tests in 2019, which it’ll do by opening a new development center near Chicago, and begin ground testing, and by continuing to hire more top talent, including recent engineers brought on from aerospace industry giants including Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Eventually, the company hopes to also field a second airframe designed to hold more passengers and replace vehicles doing longer range runs.

17,Dyson seeks to beat rivals on range with its electric car,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/04/dyson-seeks-to-beat-rivals-on-range-with-its-electric-car/,2017/10/04,"
Dyson is building an electric car, the company revealed last week, and now we know a bit more about their specific plan to bring one to market. Dyson won’t look to partner, and will instead build the vehicle hardware from the ground up itself, according to a new Wired interview with Dyson CEO Max Conze. By relying on its own battery and motor tech, Dyson hopes to be able to beat the range of existing electric vehicles by between 50 and 100 percent, Conze says.
That would indeed be a differentiating point for Dyson with its offering, and probably the best chance it has at delivering a product that can woo consumers away from electric offerings from traditional carmakers and the likes of Tesla. And Dyson says it wants to “do its own thing,” and use in-house engineering “that can do the car end-to-end and also […] own the manufacturing.”
Dyson isn’t planning on building its own self-driving software, however, and predicts it’ll be able to buy autonomous systems “off the shelf” from suppliers once the time comes for that technology to be properly integrated into a shipping vehicle.
Going it alone seems like a big challenge for a newcomer to the auto industry like Dyson – but Conze tells Wired it’s actually going to be an advantage in many ways, because they don’t have to build upon what came before. A clean slate means they can focus their efforts on something brand new, and a vehicle platform tailored totally to their electric goal.
Dyson also added that it’s not planning on investing significantly in charging infrastructure because it hopes to improve range to the point where needing to charge frequently isn’t an issue. Critics have expressed skepticism about the vacuum maker’s ability to pull this off, and seeming nonchalance about key factors like infrastructure seem to back up those doubts, but Dyson does have deep expertise with maximizing electric motor efficiency – and a history of demonstrating focus when it comes to innovating product categories that others have overlooked.

18,Tesla electric semi truck possibly spied in new photo,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/03/tesla-electric-semi-truck-possibly-spied-in-new-photo/,2017/10/03,"
Is this the new semi truck Tesla is set to unveil at the end of this month? The truck, posted to Reddit (then deleted, then re-posted) bears more than a passing resemblance to the image shared in a teaser released by the automaker itself (via The Verge). The sleek angled front also looks like something you’d expect to be electrically powered, if that makes any sense.
You can compare it yourself to the mostly shadowy teaser image shared by Tesla itself, but the main unifying factor here might be those flared fenders and angled headlights, which you can pretty clearly make out in the Reddit spy shot, too. The photo above was taken “somewhere in California,” where apparently Tesla has been known to test vehicles in the past.
Tesla’s officially revealing its semi truck on October 26, at an event teased by Elon Musk himself. The truck is rumored to have a range of between 200 and 300 miles on a single charge, which would be very impressive for an all-electric heavy-duty transport vehicle, though not something that’s suitable for long-haul trips. The big question will be how it charges – and how fast.

19,"Tesla made only 260 Model 3 cars in Q3, but is ‘confident’ it can fix bottleneck",https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/02/tesla-made-only-260-model-3-cars-in-q3-but-is-confident-it-can-fix-bottleneck/,2017/10/02,"
Tesla has released its quarterly vehicle production numbers for the third quarter of 2017, which it says was its “all-time best quarter for Model S and Model X deliveries” — but it was not a great quarter for production of the Model 3, of which only 260 were made. This was far under predicted totals, which Tesla ascribes to “production bottlenecks,” though it also says that it “understands” the issues and that there are “no fundamental issues with the Model 3 Production or supply chain.”
Tesla had said in August that it should be able to achieve production of around 1,500 cars during the quarter, so it clearly undershot its earlier target. This explains why, at the Model 3 initial employee launch event in July, Elon Musk stressed that Model 3 would face “production hell,” which would proceed only at the pace of its slowest component production rate.
Tesla says that it is “confident of addressing the manufacturing bottleneck issues in the near-term,” but didn’t provide an updated prediction for its future production capacity. Musk said in July that it knows that its production rate for the 3 will look like an S-curve, but it’s not yet sure the scale and shape of that S-curve, as the component supply chain for the vehicle includes 30 percent of parts sourced from outside North America, and is subject to significant “force majeure risk.”
Including the Model 3, Tesla produced 25,336 vehicles, the vast majority of which were Model S and X vehicles. Of the 260 Model 3s it made during the quarter, 220 were delivered to customers, those being presumably mostly staff and investors.

20,GM to introduce two new all-electric cars by 2019 in path to zero emissions,https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/02/gm-to-introduce-two-new-all-electric-cars-by-2019-in-path-to-zero-emissions/,2017/10/02,"
GM today announced a strategy to eventually deliver a zero emission product line across all its segments, though it didn’t put a specific timeline on when it would achieve that goal. The process is complex, said Mark Reuss, EVP Global Product Development, and GM doesn’t see there being “one year where we flip a switch and it’s all electric.”
Still, GM is committing to rolling out two new all-electric vehicles within the next 18 months, and to having at least 20 new all-electric vehicles in the market by 2023. GM also debuted its new SURUS fuel-cell concept platform today, which is a four-wheel steering concept truck-based vehicle with two electric motors and a flexible design which could work with a range of different vehicles in commercial capacities, including delivery vehicles, trucks or ambulances.
This build on previous declarations made by GM CEO Mary Barra, who announced that the company is ultimately committed to world with zero emissions, and zero crashed. The Chevrolet Bolt has helped immensely with progress towards the zero emissions part, Reuss said.
He noted that GM has sold “thousands” of the Bolt in its first year, and that Chevrolet customers “love them.” Reuss also added that the Bolt is a “window into how GM will move humanity forward in the future, with all-electric propulsion.”
Reuss added that “GM believes the future is all-electric,” and that “these aren’t just words in a war of press releases,” referring to the spate of recent announcements by automakers committing to offering either hybrid or electric versions of their entire lineup by some future date. GM cautioned that its approach will be more methodical, however, and based on user feedback.
“An electric solution cannot be one size fits all,” Reuss said. “We believe you need both battery electric and fuel cell electric… how we apply each of these technologies will depend on what we hear from customers about their needs.”
Meanwhile, GM said it will continue to increase efficiency of fuel injection vehicles to facilitate the transition. Reuss noted that GM has advantages in this race because
“light weighting of vehicles has been a priority over many years,” even with its fuel cars, and you then combine that with the agility of the battery pack, and GM’s strategy of reducing the coast of battery packs in use by reducing the size of the battery pack itself to find its competitive advantage.
Reuss repeatedly emphasized the importance of fuel cell electric in GM’s zero emission strategy, since it’ll become part of both consumer retail and military, commercial, utility segments for the automaker. He said that they’ll start with commercial infrastructure to support such a rollout, and then have that transition to informing the retail segment infrastructure rollout as well.

21,Dyson is working on an electric car set to launch by 2020,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/dyson-is-working-on-an-electric-car-set-to-launch-by-2020/,2017/09/26,"
Dyson, maker of high-tech vacuum cleaners and fans, has long been rumored to be getting into the car game. That’s no longer a rumor, as the company has confirmed that it’s working on a battery electric vehicle with an all-electric drivetrain to be launched by 2020.
The news comes from Dyson founder James Dyson himself, who announced the project via an internal company-wide email. The email details how Dyson’s original vision for the cyclonic motor that’s a trademark ingredient in its hand dryers and vacuums was originally inspired by a desire to take emissions from diesel engines out of the air.
That original diesel capture system didn’t catch on as Dyson would’ve hoped, but it would eventually prove the basis for the motors it uses in its own vacuums, including battery-powered cordless options that combine power and efficiency. Dyson says that his goal and the goal of his company, however remained reduction of global pollution levels.

That’s why they’re combining the efforts of a variety of their teams, and expertise built to create their other consumer products in one effort to develop this battery electric car. Dyson has a team consisting of its “top” engineers, including a number of automotive industry veterans, that number over 400 already, and it’s set to invest nearly $3 billion in the project.
Dyson is staying mum on info beyond that it’s working on a car and hopes to have it on the road by 2020. We knew this was likely coming, thanks to hires and other info, but it’s still exciting to see the UK-based global tech leader enter the fray in a field very different from where it’s had previous success.

22,Daimler answers Elon Musk’s Twitter challenge on EVs,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/daimler-answers-elon-musks-twitter-challenge-on-evs/,2017/09/26,"
Elon Musk uses Twitter to express his thoughts frankly and directly, and he just took issue with a USA Today story about the size of a rival automaker’s bet on electric vehicle technology. Musk noted that the reported $1 billion Daimler was spending on taking on Tesla was not enough for such a large company – and Daimler agreed.
In response to Musk’s tweet that the $1 billion figure cited in the USA Today tweet was too low, Daimler said that the Tesla CEO was “absolutely right” and then pointed out that it’s actually investing over $10 billion, including its next generation EV spend on top of its $1 billion investment in battery production alone.

Musk didn’t actually prompt any change in Daimler’s plans (or not in this tweet anyway – Tesla as a company has had an impact on the EV industry at large that’s hard to quantify). Instead, Musk was guilty of that cardinal Twitter sin: Not clicking through and assuming the whole story is the headline or 140 character summary. Jalopnik’s Dean Kawamura pointed this out, but Musk’s cheeky answer could either be a straight up joke, or a reference to the fact that Tesla has changed the game for EVs. I prefer to interpret it as the latter.

23,Fairphone takes $7.7M to push for change across the electronics value chain,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/fairphone-takes-7-7m-to-push-for-change-across-the-electronics-value-chain/,2017/09/26,"
European mobile device maker Fairphone, which designs modular smartphones with the aim of supporting repairability and encouraging sustainability, has taken in new investment of €6.5 million ($7.7M). It says it’s hoping to use the financing to build wider support for a push towards a circular economy for consumer electronics.
Specifically it says it intends to use the money to scale up its proposition to try to have that wider impact. Point is, it isn’t easy building electronics with a longer than average lifespan. Consumer upgrade cycles are embedded into the entire supplier system, from hardware parts to software patches.
That’s why Fairphone had to end support for its first repairable-by-design handset this summer. Owners of the device would only have had between two and 3.5 years’ support in all, and the company took some flak for bowing out on the device given their mission is intended to support the opposite: electronics with longevity.
Co-founder Bas van Abel explained the decision as a consequence of Fairphone being unable to source hardware spare parts for the handset after suppliers shifted their business to keep up with industry cycles and retired the necessary spare parts.
Another problem is that chipset manufacturers stop releasing software updates after a while — and Fairphone said the expense and difficulty of writing the necessary updates itself was not something it could afford to take on for the first handset.
“There is very little set up by the industry for sustainable production in its current state and we are working to change that,” van Abel said at the time.
The company had used a crowdfunding route to help them build that first device. But the realization they’ve clearly come to is you can’t just be a sustainable device maker on your own; you need to inspire an entire ecosystem to work towards the same goal.
The new investment is therefore aimed at trying to scale its approach to building sustainable electronics “throughout the entire electronics value chain, including material sourcing, production, distribution and recycling”. In short, creating a viable market “for fairer electronics” means bringing along suppliers, as well as spiking enough consumer demand.
The funding is coming from Pymwymic Impact Investing Cooperative, which invests in companies with an environmental or social purpose and has two decades of experience doing so; along with another social impact investor, DOEN Participaties, the investment arm of the Dutch Postcode Lottery (and also an investor in Fairphone from the beginning); plus some unnamed others.
“In line with our ambitions to raise the bar in the electronics industry, we aim to increase our leverage with electronics suppliers to negotiate a healthier, more future-proof supply chain. This touches on a variety of issues, including the availability and lifespan of electronic components, the sourcing of Fairtrade gold and improving working conditions. By bringing these principles to the table, we can inspire an entire system change,” said van Abel in a statement.
The company has also brought on a new managing director, Eva Gouwens, and touts her experience in growing a social enterprise — “both in terms of organization as well as value chain impact”.
In terms of the size of its own community, Fairphone says it’s sold its smartphones to more than 135,000 individuals over four years.

24,Nikola and Bosch team on powertrain design for hydrogen electric long-haul trucks,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/19/nikola-and-bosch-team-on-powertrain-design-for-hydrogen-electric-long-haul-trucks/,2017/09/19,"
Nikola Motor Company, the Utah-based company that is working on building heavy-duty transport trucks using hybrid hydrogen-electric powertrains, announced today that it’s partnering with global automotive industry supply leader Bosch to design and build said powertrains. The company also revealed the first ever image of its Nikola Two truck design (above), with a smaller, ‘day cab’ style design but similar range and performance to the Nikola One long-haul semi truck.
Nikola (yes, which takes its name from electrical engineer, inventor and futurist Nikola Tesla) is hoping to bring to market its Nikola One and Two trucks by 2021, offering Class 8 multi-axle heavy load transport trucks that produce no direct emissions in the form of exhaust thanks to an electric drivetrain, which can achieve true long haul range thanks to the use of hydrogen hybrid technology to extend beyond the max range available to battery-only vehicles.
Nikola will use Bosch’s eAxle design to help bring their truck to market as fast as possible, and will work with Bosch on building the first ever true dual-motor commercial-vehicle eAxle intended for long-haul trucking. The eAxle itself is, as you might guess from the name, a vehicle axle connecting the truck’s wheels – but It also contains the electric motor, power electronics and the transmission in a single, modular unit.
Nikola One rendering
Bosch has ample experience developing the eAxle, so that should help considerably in easing the challenge of bringing Nikola’s technically challenging vision to market. The two companies will also work together on building the vehicle’s overall powertrain.
Tesla is set to unveil its own fully electric semi truck at an event next month, but we don’t yet know when it’ll make it to market. The Tesla truck could reportedly have some autonomous capabilities, but will likely have a range of at most around 300 miles per charge, something Nikola’s hybrid design can easily top with an estimated range of 1,200 miles on a full tank of 220 lbs of hydrogen.

25,DFJ’s Steve Jurvetson thinks Elon’s Boring Co. will win with short tunnels first,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/18/dfjs-steve-jurvetson-thinks-elons-boring-co-will-win-with-short-tunnels-first/,2017/09/18,"
Noted Silicon Valley investor and SpaceX investor Steve Jurvetson is probably better positioned than most to know what Elon Musk is thinking with The Boring Company, his project to build a better tunnel boring concern, which he created essentially because he was fed up with sitting in traffic in L.A.
Though The Boring Co.’s most recent headlines have hailed Musk’s plans to potentially build a city-to-city underground hyperloop network, Jurvetson talked about the near-term potential of shorter tunnels, and tunnels designed specifically for electric vehicles.



“I personally love the idea even more than the hyperloop idea,” Jurvetson told TechCrunch’s Connie Loizos on stage at Disrupt SF 2017 in San Francisco. Why? Because the vision is that they could work with electric vehicles exclusively once those proliferate enough, which means you don’t need to manage exhaust, Jurvetson pointed out.
“The whole concept of tunnels changes,” he said, once you change that key ingredient, since tunnels can be much smaller, making them easier to dig and interconnect and overlay. That means less complexity, less potential to affect surface structure and easier construction, enabling things like short undercut routes that bypass busy freeways currently clogged with traffic – some of which just happens to be using the same route as others headed to the same concentrated focal point, like an airport, even if they’re going somewhere else entirely.
While hyperloop tunnels still make sense over longer distances, Jurvetson thinks those are still very expensive, complex projects that are a long way off. In the nearer term, EV undercut routes across shorter distance seem “a little simpler,” he said.
Once laid out, this makes plenty of obvious sense. But again, it raises the question of how Musk come up with this stuff. Jurvetson had a great answer.
“Think forward 500 years, what is the inevitable endpoint that no one will debate?” he says the prolific founder asks himself. He then figures out what it’ll take to get there, and what opportunities available along the way will make it happen.

The Mission E was revealed originally back in 2015, but it’s now entering the final stages of development before actually shipping, according to Car Magazine. The Mission E has an entirely electric powertrain, and is set to occupy a spot between the Panamera and the 911 in Porsche’s overall vehicle lineup. It’s a four-door sports car, and is gearing up for its initial public prototype tests.

We don’t have final stats yet for the car and its specs, but we do know that the original concept had a 600bhp motor, and could help Porsche go head-to-head with Tesla’s Model S. It has four-wheel drive, and could get from 0-60 mph in under 3.5 seconds. Its speed tops out at over 155 mph, too.
As for charge, it could get as much as 300 miles on a single full battery. It’ll also have 350kW fast-charging.

Nissan’s new Leaf is the updated version of one of the pioneers of the modern all-electric consumer car, and the change is a promising one. The new vehicle offers 150 miles of range based on EPA estimates, which is a lot more than its predecessor at 107 miles (if off a bit when compared to other modern EVs like the Chevrolet Bolt).
For Nissan, it’s being positioned as the first EV that isn’t an “EV” first – it’s just a car, in other words, like any other, but it happens to have a fully electric drivetrain. The company also rethought the look and feel of the vehicle, again bringing in some more conventional, attractive lines vs. the bubble-like geometry of the last model.
Inside, it’s a more spacious vehicle, with a lot of cargo and passenger capacity for everyday use. The battery also charges faster, and can build up as much as 22 miles of range in just an hour of charging when connected to a 240V source.

Nissan has also brought a lot of advanced tech fears to the vehicle, including Android Auto, CarPlay and more. It has ProPILOT Assist, too, and is the first Nissan in the U.S. to offer the advanced driving assist features, which include maintaining speed, lane-keeping and even full breaking in highway driving.
Nissan is also promoting its Leaf-to-Home power system, which is coming to the U.S. for the first time, and which allows houses to draw energy back from the car, letting it act as a sort of backup battery for any emergency outages or other use.
Starting at $29,990 in the U.S. for the base model, the 2018 Leaf is also a bit less expensive than the 2017, which is impressive considering how much more they put into the car. It’s definitely an attractive car, and one with a lot more utilitarian appeal than Leafs that have come before. Mostly, the remaining question will be whether Nissan has done enough to make it a vehicle with more mainstream appeal.

28,Daimler’s electric short-haul city trucks are coming to the U.S.,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/14/daimlers-electric-short-haul-city-trucks-are-coming-to-the-u-s/,2017/09/14,"
Daimler’s Fuso eCanter trucks, which are fully electric and have a range of 60 miles per charge, are making their way to the U.S. for the first time (via Reuters) for customers in New York City. Daimler’s announcement of the move for its Mitsubishi Fuso trucking unit comes at the same time as Elon Musk has set the reveal of Tesla’s all-electric semi truck for October 26.
The eCanter can handle a payload of over 10,000 lbs, and seats up to three in the cabin. It’s designed for hauling goods within cities with a large physical footprint, though it lacks the longer range of long-haul vehicles. Tesla’s semi truck is reportedly going to offer between 200 and 300 miles of range on a single charge, which would make it more suitable for medium-length trucking runs between cities.
Both are still far under their diesel-powered equivalents in terms of driving range, but in a city setting the Fuso makes a lot of sense when you facto in fuel cost and potential maintenance savings, and Daimler offers it in various configurations with more or less range and battery capacity depending on how much cargo area a customer is willing to give up.
The eCanter already has a Japanese customer by way of Seven-Eleven, which is set to put 25 of the trucks into operation in the country.

29,Tesla semi truck unveil event ‘tentatively’ set for October 26,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/13/tesla-semi-truck-unveil-event-tentatively-set-for-october-26/,2017/09/13,"
Tesla had previously set September as the timeframe for their big unveiling of an all-electric semi truck created by the company. The big rig is now set to be shown off for the first time on October 26, however, in Hawthorne, California (which is where the SpaceX HQ is located).
Elon Musk tweeted the revised date on Wednesday, noting also that it would include a “test ride,” meaning it’ll be operational when it’s first revealed to the public.


Tesla Semi truck unveil & test ride tentatively scheduled for Oct 26th in Hawthorne. Worth seeing this beast in person. It's unreal.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 13, 2017



While Musk had originally set the September reveal window for the electric semi truck way back in April, it’s not uncommon for the company’s timelines to shift somewhat later than intended. All things considered, a mere month later is pretty much on track by Musk’s standards.
The Tesla truck event could fill in more of our knowledge gaps about the Tesla transport vehicle, too — including whether or not it includes autonomous driving technology, as we learned is possible from a report in early August.
We could also get confirmation of its planned range: Reuters reported between 200 and 300 miles last month, which would require a significant battery pack, and potentially a lot of charging time to restore its range.
Musk himself promised some interesting additional surprises at the planned event, noting that it would include possibly “a little more than we’re saying here” when discussing the event in June at the Tesla annual shareholder meeting.

30,Honda will offer electrified option of all new vehicle models in Europe,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/honda-will-offered-electrified-option-of-all-new-vehicle-models-in-europe/,2017/09/12,"
Honda will offer an electrified version of all of its new models launched in Europe from now on, the company announced at this year’s Frankfurt Motor Show. Honda CEO Takahiro Hachigo revealed the news on stage at Honda’s conference event at the auto show, and noted that while Honda wants to have electrified vehicle options account for two-thirds of all its new cars sales by 2030, it’s targeting 2025 for that same split in Europe because of stronger interest in that region.
Honda offering hybrid and fully electric cars on all new models going forward and Europe should help in terms of providing consumer choice. The Honda CR-V Hybrid, a prototype for which was introduced at the show, will be Honda’s first hybrid SUV on sale in Europe starting in 2018. Honda intends to add even more EV options throughout its lineup to come, including the Urban EV concept it also debuted at Frankfurt.
As part of its electric strategy it’s also introducing a new energy transfer system called the power Manager Concept that can reverse the flow of energy from a vehicle battery to the home to reduce dependence on the grid, and even sell power back to energy companies when it makes sense to do so. These will begin being installed in France first, during a pilot in the western part of the country with a target completion date of 2020.
Many automakers are going all-in on electrification plans, with announcements regarding target dates for when all vehicles in their lineup will have electric options. Honda hasn’t revealed a global target date for that yet, but this European announcement indicates it’s already planning in that direction.

31,Audi’s Aicon concept ditches pedals and wheel in favor of full autonomy,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/audis-aicon-concept-ditches-pedals-and-wheel-in-favor-of-full-autonomy/,2017/09/12,"
Audi’s looking ahead to the what its vehicles will look like once true self-driving technology is available and on the roads with the Aicon, a new concept vehicle it’s debuting at the Frankfurt Motor Show in Germany. The Aicon ditches the steering wheel and pedals in favor of a design aimed at luxury and comfort, with a four-door, 2 by 2 seating design that can be quickly changed up depending on how many people are riding and whether they want to stretch out.
The purely electric Aicon also has an ambitious range from its big battery – nearly 500 miles on one charge, which would make it one hell of a robotic ride sharing car.

What might be most interesting about the Audi Aicon is how much it still looks like an aggressively-styled performance automobile, rather than something you’d create just to optimize for use of interior space or transportation practicality. It has 26-inch wheels, housed with flared fenders, and a long, low body that conveys a sense of forward motion.
Clearly, Audi thinks performance will still be important to those using cars even when they’re no longer driving them. The user experience will also be key, of course, and Audi has some interesting innovations there with the Aicon, too, including a companion drone that comes with the car, and a built-in “empathetic electronic vehicle assistant.”
That assistant, called “PIA,” can recognize riders by their phone and then tweak vehicle settings to their custom specifications, including things like cabin comforts, lighting and seating position. It also responds to voice commands for things like navigation destination and entertainment.

The included drone has a built-in flashlight and is called a “light companion,” designed primarily for lighting a user’s path as they enter and exit the vehicle at night. The car does away with long-range headlights for nighttime driving, relying instead on its autonomous sensor suite to navigate dark driving conditions.
For conveying its presence to others, however, it has projector modules that can display signs on the ground around. For those inside, it can display media either on its interior screens, or even on the windshield as a heads-up viewing area for movies or whatever you’re working on.
This concept is maybe one of the more fully fleshed out visions of what a truly autonomous long-range car would look like in practice. It’s still obviously quite a ways off from actually becoming a reality, but this is definitely the direction automakers are thinking.

BMW has a new electric concept vehicle designed to show how it envisions occupying its electric model range between the i3 and the i8: The i Visions Dynamics. The four-dour luxury coupe has a head-turning design, including Tesla-familiar features like flush door handles, but BMW is also touting its range at a whopping 373 miles, with a top speed of over 120 mph and a 0-to-60 mph time of just four seconds.
The concept is part of BMW’s overall electrification plan, which sees the automaker fielding 25 electrified models by 2025, with 12 of those being purely electric vehicles. The i Vision Dynamics represents a look at what some of those cars can look like.

It has a fully glass roof without any cross-supports, and a focus on interior comfort and passenger experience. That’s partially designed to help support semi and fully autonomous driving down the road, BMW says.
That front grill is inspired by the current look for BMW automobiles, but houses sensors and an “intelligent surface” rather than being intended for engine cooling. There’s a lit model name display on the back of the vehicle, and unique LED headlights that emphasize the sporty design.

If the stats remain consistent between this concept and whatever production vehicle gets made in terms of a four-door from BWM in its electric performance lineup, this could be a real Tesla Model S competitor, offering similar performance and potentially much better range, though the figures given today are far from EPA standard tallies.
If this is what the future of BMW’s electric i lineup looks like, count me in. Of course, a lot can change between concept and production, but this looks to be on the right track.

33,Honda’s picture-perfect Urban EV concept car aims for 2019 production,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/12/hondas-picture-perfect-urban-ev-concept-car-aims-for-2019-production/,2017/09/12,"
This new concept from Honda, the Urban EV, looks like something most automakers would show off as a distant vision of what cars might look like in five or ten years’ time. Honda, however, says it’s targeting a launch of the vehicle in European markets by 2019 – just two years from now.
The EV Concept has a look seemingly inspired by hatchbacks from the 70s or 80s, including some of Honda’s own early Civic models. The car is far from retro in other regards, however, including the displays front and back of the vehicle which show charging percentage and rates, as well as brand badging and other information, like greetings, “advice for other drivers on the roads” and more.

Honda’s EV Concept also has an expansive touchscreen display which spans nearly the entire interior dashboard, offering a view Honda describes as “panoramic.” The screen even extends into the doors, and those display feeds from the car’s two wing mirror cameras for checking the space around the vehicle.

It’s a compact in terms of exterior dimensions, and a two-door, but there are four seats within, both bench style. The vehicle is designed for maximum interior spaces given its small stature, however.
Onboard intelligence is provided via Honda’s Automated Network Assistant, which is designed to learn about a driver over time and then adapt that information in order to help provide info like routing recommendations or other tips intended to be customized to a driver’s personal preferences.
This is a very cool car, and one that I’d love to see offered beyond European borders. Honda’s also basing it on an entirely new, electric-specific platform, which is intended to help guide their EV strategy going forward.

34,Volkswagen to offer electric versions of all of its vehicles by 2030,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/volkswagen-to-offer-electric-versions-of-all-of-its-vehicles-by-2030/,2017/09/11,"
Volkswagen is the latest car maker to announce a move to electrify its entire range of automobile offerings: The car maker will provide either hybrid or electric versions of every one of its 300 models by 2030, it announced today ahead of the Frankfurt Motor Show in German.
VW’s not the first to make a similar commitment — and in fact Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz announced it was going to do the same by 2022 earlier today. But the Volkswagen Group’s vehicle range is quite a bit larger than Mercedes-Benz’s, which makes this a more significant overall commitment.
By 2025, Volkswagen plans to offer 80 new electric vehicles across its group and sub-brands, which include Audi, Bentley, Bugatti and the Volkswagen brand itself. VW has committed to spend nearly $23 billion U.S. on getting this plan in place via zero emissions technology investment, and it also said it would commit more than $55 billion toward purchasing batteries to provide power for these vehicles.
The news also follows the big announcement from this weekend that China would be banning fossil fuel burning vehicles eventually, joining commitments made by the U.K. and France before. There’s clearly a trend on both the regulatory and the industry side of the equation with regards to electrified vehicles, but there will still be a lot of questions and work to be done in terms of maturing the supply chain and overcoming technology and infrastructure challenges.

35,Mercedes-Benz will electrify its entire car lineup by 2022,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/mercedes-benz-will-electrify-its-entire-car-lineup-by-2022/,2017/09/11,"
Mercedes-Benz is the latest automaker to embrace electrification, announcing that it will be electrifying its entire vehicle lineup by 2022. Get used to it: Car makers are going to be making these announcements at an increasing clip, especially now that China, the most important car market in the world right now, has announced plans to eventually move to ban the sale of fossil fuel vehicles entirely.
Here’s the deal: Mercedes-Benz chief Dieter Zetsche said that the car maker will offer either hybrid or fully electric versions of its vehicles by 2022, adding up to a total of a minimum of 50 new electric model options by that time. Smart, meanwhile, another Daimler-owned sub-brand, will go fully electric by 2020.
This puts Mercedes-Benz in good company with other higher-end car manufacturers, including Volvo, which have committed to offering a fully electrified lineup by 2019, and Ford’s Lincoln luxury sub-brand has also set 2022 as the deadline for offering electric variants of each of its vehicle models.
As mentioned, China announced over the weekend that it would eventually ban the sale of all fossil fuel-powered cars in the country, within a timeline to be determined. China’s vehicle sales numbers have led the world recently, and are increasing at an impressive clip annually, so automakers reconfiguring their long-term strategy to focus on EVs in light of China’s favoring of EV tech makes plenty of sense. France and the U.K. have also expressed plans to phase out fossil fuel cars by 2040.

36,Tesla begins Supercharger network city expansion with Chicago and Boston,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/tesla-begins-supercharger-network-city-expansion-with-chicago-and-boston/,2017/09/11,"
Tesla is ramping up its deployment of Supercharger stations across the U.S. and internationally as part of its commitment to addressing growing demand, especially in light of the Model 3 beginning production. Now, it’s moving to get Superchargers in more populated city centers, in addition to highway and travel destination spots outside of metropolitan areas.
Tesla revealed today that its work to bring the Supercharger network to city centers starts with locations in downtown Chicago and Boston that open Monday, and that these new Supercharger stations for urban areas have a new design that includes rapid charging with a dedicated 72 kW of power per vehicle — so that with multiple cars at the same station, there’s no downgrade in charging rates.
That should allow a full charge within 45 to 50 minutes on average, Tesla says. The new Supercharger stations also have new physical designs that allow them to take up less space, which is obviously better for tight-packed parking spots common for cities.
The new locations include 10 stalls in Chicago at 225 North Columbus Drive, and 8 stalls at 800 Boylston Street in Boston. The spots are updated in Tesla’s routing software, too, so you can find exactly where they are at these new addresses, and they’re open 24 hours a day, just like Tesla’s existing network.

37,China plans to ban sales of fossil fuel cars entirely,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/10/china-plans-to-ban-sales-of-fossil-fuel-cars-entirely/,2017/09/10,"
China’s big electric vehicle push is about to get even bigger: The country is planning to end the sale of fossil fuel-powered vehicles entirely, with regulators working currently on a timetable of when the ban will ultimately take effect, according to Bloomberg.
China is the world’s largest auto market, with 28.03 million vehicles sold last year, a boost in demand of 13.7 percent vs. 2015 sales numbers. The nation has already done a lot to incentivize manufacturers to develop and sell new EVs, including allowing foreign automakers to create a third joint venture with local automakers (a standard requirement for doing business in the country for auto OEMs) so long as it’s dedicated to the creation of EVs exclusively.
The government has also created a number of incentive programs for OEMs, including subsidies. This will add to its positive efforts to drive more EV sales in China with the ultimate negative condition on the other side – at some point, automakers just won’t be able to do business at all in the country if they’re still selling a mix of fossil fuel and electrified vehicles.
This isn’t the first time a governing body has said it would eventually phase out the sale of traditional fuel vehicles: France said it will stop selling fossil fuel cars by 2040 in July, and the UK has committed to the same timeline for sales of those vehicles.
Critics have suggested that a ban on fossil fuel vehicles is likely impractical, because it would stretch an already taxed supply chain, which has some hard limits in terms of the volume of lithium available for lithium-ion battery cells, for instance. But automakers are already responding to this rising trend with expanded EV model lineups and, in the case of Volvo for instance, plans to eventually sell exclusively all-electric or hybrid cars.
China’s timeline for establishing this ban will be crucial in terms of how quickly we see the global shift to EVs occur, as it’s going to be an immense lever in terms of automaker strategic planning internationally, as well as in the country.

38,"Uber plans to electrify uberX in London by 2019, entire city fleet by 2025",https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/08/uber-plans-to-electrify-uberx-in-london-by-2019-entire-city-fleet-by-2025/,2017/09/08,"
Uber is looking to get in line with London’s forthcoming transport rules regarding the use of zero emissions vehicles for private hire car service in the city. London has set an aggressive target of requiring that all new London private hire vehicles be zero emission cars by 2020, and the city hopes to be entirely emission-free by 2050.
Uber has plans to electrify its entire London vehicle fleet by 2025, and to make sure that all cars on its uberX offering are either fully electric or hybrid vehicles by 2019. That’s an ambitious goal, especially given that Uber can’t just replace its own fleet of cars – since it doesn’t own one. Instead, it has to incentivize the switch for drivers.
Partly, the incentive will be actually being able to operate in London once the new rules go through. But Uber is also announcing a new funding arrangement for anyone looking to upgrade to a hybrid or electric vehicle, which could range up to as much as £5,000 ($6,604 US) depending on conditions met. Uber’s also handing out up to £1,5000 ($1,981 US) in Uber credit for London residents who ditch their old diesel car.
All told, Uber is committing as much as £150 million (nearly $200 million US) on its fund over time – but it’s not solely generating the funds from existing sources: It’s adding a £0.35 ($0.45 US) fee on the rider to rides in the city to help pay for the transition. Teamwork makes the dream work.

Ford’s Lincoln luxury brand is looking to field electrified powertrain options for all of its vehicles by 2022, according to a new Reuters report. That’s the third major piece of news today about an automaker either going all-electric or expanding their electric lineup significantly, for those keeping count.
Ford’s electric plans for Lincoln could be fully revealed as soon as next month, per the report, and could help the company with its plans in China, which is gradually introducing rules for auto sales in the country designed to encourage the update of EVs.
Lincoln’s electrification strategy apparently focuses on hybrid vehicles specifically, with the aim of contributing to Ford’s overall program of fielding nearly 20 new electrified vehicles by around 2022. Lincoln’s competitors are also making significant bets on electric, including Volvo, which has committed to offering electric and hybrid-only drivetrain options on all new vehicles by 2019.
Plug-in hybrids of existing and new models should start to roll out beginning with new MKC and Aviator crossovers, set for introduction in 2019, per the report, with a hybrid Navigator also set to make a debut that year.

BMW says that it’ll have a total of 25 electrified vehicles in its lineup by 2025, with a full dozen of those being full-electric cars. These should have a usable range of up to 435 miles, BMW CEO Harald Krueger told reporters, according to Reuters.
That’s another brick in the wall for the ongoing automotive market powertrain switch, which gained steam today with another announcement from Jaguar Land Rover, which committed to making sure its entire lineup of vehicles has an electrified option by 2020.
The BMW move will include making sure it has the ability to mass produce its electric vehicles and drivetrains in sufficient quantities to cover the range and demand: All of its cars should also be able to offer electrified powertrain options, whether fully electric or hybrid, by the 2020 mark.
BMW is planning to show off a new zero-emission all-electric four-dour vehicle at the Frankfurt auto show next week, which will sit between the current i3 and i8 offerings in its EV lineup.

Jaguar has a new electric vehicle – but it’s also a very old one. The new Jaguar E-type Zero pairs a car once described by Enzo Ferrari as “the most beautiful” in the world now has a zero emission drivetrain, created by Jaguar Land Rover Classic Works in Coventry, England.
The rebuilt E-type looks the same as the original, but it actually beats its performance with a 0-60mph time of under 5.5 seconds, which is around 1 second better than the gas-powered classic Series 1 version. The other big difference? LED headlights replace the incandescents, as a way of getting more bang for your buck when it comes to that electric power source.

The powertrain can put out 220kW and is tailor-made for the E-type, with a lithium-ion battery pack that has nearly the same physical dimensions as the six-cylinder engine that gave the original car its get-up-and-go. This has another benefit: the original engine can be swapped in with relative ease at any time, should you feel even more nostalgic for the E-type’s racing heyday.

It might just be the coolest electric car ever made, but don’t start hoarding your cash just yet, as there are no firm plans to release it. Still, Jaguar Land Rover says it’s going to “investigate bringing this concept to market,” so there is reason to hope.

42,Every Jaguar and Land Rover vehicle from 2020 on will have an electric option,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/every-jaguar-and-land-rover-vehicle-from-2020-on-will-have-an-electric-option/,2017/09/07,"
Jaguar Land Rover is joining the rising chorus of automakers embracing electric and fusion powertrain options, revealing that all new vehicles in both the Jaguar and Land Rover range will offer an electric or hybrid option from 2020 on. Jaguar Land Rover announced the news on Thursday at its very first Tech Fest event, noting that this will include fully electric, plug-in hybrid and mild hybrid vehicles.
While it’s not quite as extreme as committing to produce only electric or hybrid vehicles, as have both Volvo and Aston Martin, it’s still a significant step towards promoting alternative drivetrain technologies.
Jaguar Land Rover’s decision to introduce a full range of electrified options represents an aggressive quickening of pace for the car makers drivetrain change-up plans; the Jaguar I-PACE, the company’s first fully electric model is set to enter the market next year.
The tide is clearly turning in favor of electrified drivetrains in the automotive industry, and now the major questions remaining are around how infrastructure and consumers will deal with this coming transition.

43,The new 2018 Nissan Leaf offers 150 miles of EV range,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/the-new-2018-nissan-leaf-offers-150-miles-of-ev-range/,2017/09/05,"
Nissan unveiled its new 2018 all-electric Leaf at a special event on Tuesday, and the much-anticipated successor to one of the earliest production EVs had some interesting tricks up its sleeve. Most of these focused on intelligent driver assistance features, including ProPILOT semi-autonomous driving and parking capabilities.
The Leaf also had an updated body design, with a more aerodynamic look aimed at helping to make the most of its onboard electric battery. That battery provides 150 miles of range under EPA estimates (400 km or 238 miles under the less conservative Japanese rating agency standards), which is better than the just-over 100 miles of the last generation, but below some of its key rivals at the entry-level including the Tesla Model 3 and the Chevrolet Bolt for range.
The battery can be charged in 16 hours using 3 kW charger, or 8 hours using a high-output 6 kW hour charger. A quick charge option will allow it to gain back 80 percent of its charge in just 40 minutes, too. Higher range, higher power performance version will be available at additional cost in 2018.
Nissan also tried to downplay the ‘EV’ identity of the car, arguing that it’s actually just a car – they’re trying to draw equivalence between electric vehicles and vehicles that use traditional fuel-injection vehicles, as a way of signaling that this will be a much more broad-reaching focus going forward in terms of market ambitions.

Nissan is also promoting its ProPILOT features here, which offer intelligent, hands-free parking, as well as SAE Level 2 features when driving on single-lane highways, including lane-keeping and maintaining distance between the car and vehicles ahead, with automatic acceleration and braking.
The new Leaf features regenerative braking, which allows for single-pedal driving if you’ve got the foot skills and sense of timing. It has enough friction to hold the vehicle stock still even when on an incline, according to Nissan.
On the inside, there’s a 7-inch full-color TFT touchscreen display, which provides the visuals for the new Safety Shield tech that shows you what’s going on around your car, and it also supports Apple CarPlay for iPhone users.
U.S. pricing starts at $29,990 (below current models) and the Leaf is slated to go on sale October 2 in Japan, and deliveries in the U.S., Canada and Europe are likely to begin in January, 2018. Nissan has said that pricing will be comparable to that of the current model, and that it feels “certain” it will be able to at least double or maybe even triple sales at home in Japan.

44,Watch Nissan debut its new 2018 LEAF electric car live right here,https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/05/watch-nissan-debut-its-new-2018-leaf-electric-car-live-right-here/,2017/09/05,"

Nissan’s new LEAF is making its official world premiere today at 5:30 PM PDT (8:30 PM EDT). That’s when we’ll get the first detailed look at the car, though we’ve seen some teasing images of headlights and tail lights thus far.
This should be a major revamp of the Nissan all-electric car, which was one of the first ever actually produced and sold by a major automaker. The 2018 Nissan LEAF not only gets a new leaf, but also is said to be getting a 40 kWh battery that might offer as much as 150 miles of range per charge, with potential to upgrade to a 60 kWh pack for a boosted range of around 200 miles.
That’s still not quite as much range as Tesla’s Model 3 offers, or as much as the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV, either. But the Nissan LEAF will come equipped with the company’s ProPILOT semi-autonomous driver assistance features, which offers SAE Level 2 features, including lane-keeping, acceleration and braking control.
While you’re waiting for the stream above to start, take a look at the few images Nissan has released depicting the new LEAF thus far:

Another country is looking to get rid of gas-powered vehicles entirely: Scotland, which wants to “phase out” new gas and diesel-powered cars entirely by 2032 (via The Independent). The Scottish government’s plan is set to beat the UK’s target by eight years, if all goes well, and also involves building out its roadway charging infrastructure to support the use of EVs instead.
The decision by Scotland to join in the effort to make cities and countries vehicle emission-free is not an isolated one. London has announced plans to become totally emission free by 2050, and France, Britain, Madrid and Mexico City have all made similar pledges, albeit with varying timeframes.
Some vehicle makers, likely anticipating a continued shift among international and municipal governments, have likewise outlined plans to move towards greener energy alternatives; Volvo is only going to make new hybrid and all-electric vehicles starting in 2019, and Aston Martin announced it plans to do the same beginning in the mid-2020s.

Tesla’s most expensive vehicle offerings got a discount overnight thanks to improvements in the production efficiency of the 100 kWh batteries that are used in their construction. The discounts range from $3,500 to $5,000, depending on the model, and include both the Model S and Model X top trims.
As Electrek reports, the 100D models of both the X and the S got a $3,500 discount with the new pricing, and the P100D versions get a larger $5,000 price cut. These actually restore price levels to where they were for the highest available trim packages before a small increase was put in place in April, which came alongside a discount for entry-level vehicles.
These pricing changes affect current orders that have not yet been fulfilled, according to Electrek, which is a nice surprise. Improvements in the 100 kWH battery pack process should also help Tesla keep up with demand, which is growing at last check thanks to a halo effect spiking interest around the launch of the new, more affordable Model 3.
Here’s exactly how the new pricing structure breaks down:

Model S 100D: $97,500 -> $94,000
Model S P100D: $140,000 -> $135,000
Model X 100D: $99,500 -> $96,000
Model X P100D: $145,000 -> $140,000

The MINI Electric Concept is coming to the Frankfurt Motor Show, and its debut appearance will showcase the design changes that MINI has made to signal that this is indeed the first large-scale production fully electric MINI vehicle. MINI has offered electrified versions of its existing cars, but the Electric Concept is designed from the ground up as an EV, and not just a combustion-powered car with an electric drivetrain option.
The MINI Electric Concept is set to start rolling out on the roads in full production in 2019, which marks the original Mini’s 60-year anniversary. The lines of the car are reminiscent of those found on the rest of the MINI lineup, but it’s also got a lot of unique visual changes that clearly mark it as different, including a closed front grill since cooling air flow isn’t required. The headlights, charging hub, rearview mirror turning indicators and body paint all sport elements of a stylized plug icon, the clearest outward sign that this is indeed an electric car.

It’s based on the MINI 3 door design, and it also has the two doors up front along with the hatch in the rear. The car uses fibre glass body parts to help reduce drag and increase aerodynamics, and inside there are four seats. The electric drivetrain will come from the BMW i3 line, which will likely mean the two vehicles have roughly equivalent performance in terms of charge capacity, range and pick-up.
Also, in case you had any questions as to the MINI’s national roots, the rear LED tail lots show the Union Jack in dot matrix, with one half of the flag displayed on each.

48,Aston Martin’s vehicle lineup will be 100% hybrid by the mid 2020s,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/aston-martins-vehicle-lineup-will-be-100-hybrid-by-the-mid-2020s/,2017/08/29,"
Another automaker is vowing to turn its entire lineup a little more green: Aston Martin told the Financial Times that it’ll offer vehicles exclusively with hybrid and electric cars by the middle of next decade.
It’s not as audacious a goal as it might’ve seemed even just a few years ago; Volvo has committed to selling only hybrid or electric cars by 2019, and Britain and France have both outlined plans to ban the sale of non-electric or hybrid vehicles by 2040.
Aston Martin’s announcement is significant because it’s a high-end luxury performance car maker, however, whose target demographic is precisely motoring enthusiasts. Aston Martin had previously announced plans to launch its first fully electric car, the Rapid-e, by 2019.
Don’t expect news of automakers intending to focus solely on hybrids and electrics to stop anytime soon; the writing is on the wall, now it’s just a question of in what order the dominoes fall.

Another major automaker is setting up a dedicated joint venture to build EVs for the growing demand in China, joining Ford and Volkswagen: This time, it’s Nissan-Renault, which will work with China’s Dongfeng Motor, an automaker it partnered with last year to open its first factory in China.
Automakers from outside China basically need a local dancing partner in order to make and sell vehicles in the country, without incurring huge import taxes that would basically render their operations unsustainable. Previously, automakers were limited to setting up two joint ventures with Chinese partners to produce cars in-country, but Beijing has allowed the creation of a third joint venture – provided it’s dedicated entirely to EVs.
Renault-Nissan’s new partnership with Dongfeng is called eGT New Energy Automotive Company, and it’ll be split between Nissan with 25 percent ownership, Renault with another 25, and Dongfeng with the remaining 50, according to Reuters. The first vehicle from the JV will be a new electric vehicle based on one of Renault-Nissan’s subcompact crossover SUV platform designs.
Automakers are racing to build out their EV construction and sales capacity in China thanks to strong incentives put in place by the Chinese government for the market. China is also enforcing strict quotas on overall vehicle sales, requiring that a full 8 percent of any automaker sales in the country be either pure electric or plug-in hybrid by 2018, with incremental increases in that percentage every year after that.
This could end up helping with electrification abroad, too, since it’ll help automakers reconfigure their operations to focus on developing EV tech and electric-specific vehicle designs.

50,Tesla’s electric semi truck will reportedly get 200 to 300 miles per charge,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/24/teslas-electric-semi-truck-will-reportedly-get-200-to-300-miles-per-charge/,2017/08/24,"
Tesla’s already announced plans to reveal at an event in September an all-electric semi truck designed for cargo hauling, but we don’t know much about it beyond that yet. Now, Reuters reports that the vehicle will get between 200 and 300 miles of range per charge, which means it can manage medium-length routes without much issue.
As the report notes, this doesn’t put the Tesla semi in direct competition with long-haul fuel-powered rigs; those can go upwards of 1,000 miles on a single tank. But 300 miles is still long enough for a decent chunk of routes considered at the entry-level of the “long haul” category.
Tesla has said it’s working directly with potential customers and talking to them about their needs in developing the electric semi truck, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said he’s optimistic about their interest for what Tesla will ultimately reveal. The truck will also apparently feature self-driving capability, according to an earlier Reuters report. Tesla has met with state DMVs regarding potential tests of autonomous big rig technology.
Cost will be a huge deciding factor in how attractive the Tesla truck is as an option to commercial logistics companies. Batteries that could support that length of range for heavy loads would likely be extremely expensive, but Tesla will probably sell the idea on long-term savings in terms of maintenance requirements and fuel costs.
We’ll find out soon enough what the actual range is for the Tesla semi, as the plan still seems to be to unveil it fully in September. Self-driving could also help Tesla sell the idea, especially since it sounds like Musk anticipates at least a year or two until the vehicle enters production at scale.

51,"Ojo wants to be the electric scooter for commuters, but it’s not there yet",https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/23/ojo-wants-to-be-the-electric-scooter-for-commuters-but-its-not-there-yet/,2017/08/23," 



Commuting in a busy city like San Francisco can be annoying — between all the cars, bikes, Boosted Boards and other electric gizmos zipping and weaving through lanes. The Ojo Electric scooter, while it might help with your personal traffic woes, won’t do much to help reduce the overall annoyance commuters experience.
The Ojo is designed to be an alternative mode of transportation for when you’re traveling too far to bike and too close to drive, Ojo Electric co-founder and president Dale Seiden told me. It goes up to 20 mph and can travel 25 miles on a single charge.
It’s also legal to ride in the bike lane, but cyclists might not be too happy to see you. And I say that from experience. There I was in the bike lane, minding my own business while bumping some Kendrick Lamar (the Ojo has a good set of speakers on board) and the next thing I know, I hear some aggressive bell dinging. I calmly turn around to see someone on their bike, screaming, “You’re not supposed to have your scooter in the bike lane!”
They were wrong and I was right (clearly), but I don’t blame them for thinking I wasn’t supposed to be there. In San Francisco, scooters that go over 20 mph are not allowed in the bike lane, but there was no way for them, or anyone else, to know that.
Other than the severe shade I experienced, I had a great time on the Ojo. It’s sturdy, the Bluetooth speakers sound great, it can get up hills — slowly but surely — and it’s fun to ride. The Ojo is also super easy to charge with a retractable cord that plugs into any standard power outlet.

Parking and storing it, however, brought up its own challenges. The Ojo has a motion-activated alarm system, which means that if someone even touches it, a super loud alarm will go off. I tested it and it works well, but I still felt nervous leaving it outside for too long unattended. That meant when I got home for the night, I had to drag it up the stairs and inside my small apartment once I was done riding it for the day. It was pretty annoying because, weighing in at 65 pounds, the Ojo is not easy to bring up stairs for safe-keeping.
Seiden told me after the fact that I could put a bike lock on it and leave it outside, but I would still worry someone would just cut the lock, throw the Ojo in the back of a truck and deal with the alarm later.
Ojo is currently working on a more robust scooter that can safely ride along with cars, going 35 mph, and plans to explore a type of scooter-sharing solution. It’s not clear how much that version will cost, but it would need to be less expensive than a standard Vespa-like scooter, which costs upwards of $3,000.
But competitors like Scoot Networks in San Francisco and Gogoro in Taiwan and Berlin are already tackling this space. In March, Scoot launched the Scoot Mobility Operating System to offer a white-label service to cities that may want to operate Scoot-like mobility systems. Gogoro, on the other hand, earlier this year expanded its electric scooter-sharing program in Berlin, making a total of 1,000 available in the city.
“All of these cities are starting to go to sustainable, green, eco-friendly transportation and that’s really what we’re all about,” Seiden said.
In order to further expand, Ojo plans to partner with a “large mobility company,” Seiden said. My bet is that it’s Ford, given its push into alternative forms of transportation with its new bike-sharing program in the San Francisco Bay Area and its acquisition of shuttle startup Chariot. Seiden did not confirm nor deny my theory.
You can buy the current model of the Ojo commuter scooter for $1,999.99. But if I were you, I’d wait at least until we see what the next version looks like.
To hear more from Seiden and watch me whip and nae-nae on the Ojo, check out the video below.

LG is building a new factory in Detroit suburb Hazel Park to supply electric vehicle components, the company announced on Tuesday. The facility will be a 250,000-square-foot manufacturing plant, and should result in almost 300 new jobs, LG says, with a $25 million price tag from the company and $2.9 million in grant money supplied by Michigan over the next four years.
LG’s EV components business is important to the electronics maker: during the first half of 2017, vehicle components were worth $1.5 billion in global revenue to LG, which is up 43 percent from last year. LG attributes a significant chunk of this growth to its partnership with GM in supplying components for the Bolt EV, Chevy’s low-cost long-range electric car.
Besides lithium-ion cells for the Bolt’s battery pack, LG also provides a number of other components, including the electric drive motor, the battery heater, the voltage distribution controller module, the infotainment system, the power inverter and much more. All of these are likely to be of interest to other automakers looking to build out their EV lineup, and a Michigan-based plant makes good strategic sense for filling that need.

Automaker Ford will team up with local partner Anhui Zotye Automobile to create a new joint venture in China aimed specifically at producing electric cars. The deal will see Ford and its new partner sell the vehicle sunder a local brand, rather than with its “Ford” name, and ultimately its aim is to produce even more electric vehicles for a market where there is strong incentive to bring EVs to consumers.
This is the third joint venture Ford has set up with local Chinese automakers. It’s standard practice for foreign car companies to partner with local Chinese vehicle producers, as a way to avoid having to pay very high import taxes on vehicles made by exclusively foreign-controlled concerns.
Ford has two JVs set up with other automakers including Changan Automobile and Jiangling Motors, and normally that’s the upper limit for joint ventures allowed by Chinese industry regulators. Recently, however, Beijing added an allotment for a third joint deal, provided its focus is specifically electric vehicle manufacture.
China is doing a lot to boost electric car adoption in the country, including adjusting the rules for automakers in terms of how much of their total output must be EVs. Zotye, Ford’s new partner, is an electric car specialist, with a total of 16,000 EV sales so far in 2017. Overall, Ford is aiming to make sure that 70 percent of the cars its offers in China are electric vehicles by 2025.
Ford’s not alone in building new JVs in China focused specifically on electric: Volkswagen announced plans to create its own third venture with a Chinese partner earlier this year, with production to begin in 2018.

The VW Microbus is about as iconic as they come in the world of automobiles, and the I.D. Buzz is the electric, modern incarnation of that van Volkswagen introduced as a concept back in January. In June, the automaker surprised many by announcing the I.D. Buzz would eventually become a production vehicle, instead of just another concept destined to fade away in the mists of time.
Now, Volkswagen is confirming a sale date for the I.D. Buzz – 2022, via Roadshow, who got to spend some time tooling around in a functional concept prototype of the two-tone beach companion. That’s still quite a ways off, and a lot can happen between now and then, but it’s still going to give plenty of Microbus fans hoping for a modern, green version of the roadtrip standout they can actually buy.

The I.D. Buzz has about 270 miles of range on its battery pack, which is a lot of miles between charges for those cross-country trips. VW also says it could manage to get around 369 horsepower out of its all-wheel drive motor system, which is a far cry from the original’s meek 25 HP or so. But the car isn’t about speed, really – its standout features include a reconfigurable interior that’s designed around planned autonomous capabilities.
The driver seat in the van can swivel all the way around for family card games, and the back seat configurations include the ability to clear out a middle row for ample stretching, leg and cargo space. It’s also got a nearly full length glass top for watching the stars while you recline in the back and let the Buzz drive itself.
Basically this is the car of my dreams, since anyone who knows me will tell you I love stupid boxy automobiles with an abundance of utilitarian interior space above almost all else. I also love EVs, and the fun they provide while driving, so it’ll be basically impossible to tear me away from this thing once it launches.

If you’re going to be decking your roof out with solar tiles, there’s a possibility that you may forgo what might be the best placement of a skylight in favor of more solar cell square footage. Luckily solar glass is fast becoming an option, and these clever glass blocks are the best option I’ve seen yet.

Tesla opens up Solar Roof pre-orders, answers the most important question: how much will it cost you?


Other solar glass options generally harvest in the infrared range, since if you captured the full spectrum — well, that wouldn’t be a window, it’d be a wall. But the energy you can capture is limited.
Researchers at the University of Exeter thought up an interesting alternative that may be the best of both worlds (until the next breakthrough, anyway). They created these thick blocks of glass with optical features — not quite lenses or tunnels, but sort of light guides — that funnel light from a large area on the sunny side of the window onto a much smaller cell on the inside.
By concentrating the light onto a smaller point, you get considerably more energy out of the cell’s tiny surface area than if it were ordinarily illuminated. It won’t be as much as a full-on cell covering that amount of space, but at least it’s transparent! Apart from the little cells and the wires connecting them, of course, which actually make a rather cool-looking pattern.
And because of their thickness, these Solar Squared units, as they’re called, even provide decent insulation.
Free light, free power, and free thermal insulation — or free after it pays for itself, anyway. That could make it attractive to larger building designers, who are always looking to integrate energy-saving, green features like this into their work.
Solar Squared is being spun off from the University as an independent business endeavor — a company called Build Solar.
Of course you can’t order these things right now — it’s still a prototype and they’re waiting on the patent to go through. But it’s a smart idea and one that seems likely to find its footing in the commercial world. If it sounds like a good match for something you’re building — and you’re in the UK somewhere convenient to Exeter — contact the team and maybe you can work together to put together a demo roof.

57,Fisker’s EMotion Tesla competitor will make its official debut at CES 2018,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/18/fiskers-emotion-tesla-competitor-will-make-its-official-debut-at-ces-2018/,2017/08/18,"
The first car from Henrik Fisker’s new electric vehicle company, the EMotion luxury sport sedan, will premiere at CES in January 2018. That’s according to Fisker himself, who shared the debut date with TheStreet on Friday.
We already know what the EMotion looks like, as well as its $129,000 starting price tag, and some of the technical achievements it’s said to pack, like 400 miles of range and eventual Level 4 autonomy. We also know that people won’t be able to actually get their hands on one until 2019, despite Fisker Inc. having opened pre-orders earlier this year.
This is the legendary car designer’s second crack at building a viable EV company – his first attempt, Fisker Automotive, led to a bankruptcy filing and then a subsequent sell-off to China’s Wanxiang Group, which renamed it Karma and has since debuted its Revero (which looks a lot like Fisker Automotive’s original Karma car – it’s confusing, I know).
While we also know about the new Fisker Inc. car’s carbon-fiber and aluminum construction, built-in LiDAR in the front and 9 minute, 125 mile charging capacity, there are still plenty of question marks, including about underlying tech, the promised autonomy, go-to-market strategy, and more. Plus, while we’ve seen pictures and even video of the vehicle, it’s still not made a proper in-the-flesh appearance for the public.

CES is also now the default venue for big splash reveals of new electric vehicles that have at least a decent chance of never making it to market: Last year, Faraday Future had one of the splashiest I’ve ever attended at a huge rented out warehouse in Las Vegas during the annual consumer electronics expo.

58,Infiniti’s Prototype 9 is a modern electric car with 1940s retro racer roots,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/18/infinitis-prototype-9-is-a-modern-electric-car-with-1940s-retro-racer-roots/,2017/08/18,"

Days of thunder future past? Infiniti’s newest race car prototype is actually inspired by vintage race vehicles of the 1940s, with a torpedo-style sleek cylindrical body and offset wheels at the end of extended axes. The drivetrain of the so-called ‘Prototype 9,’ however, is all 2017: It’s an electric motor, combined with a 30 kWh battery pack.
Here’s what I like about this car: It’s very cool looking. Also it has the equivalent of 148 hp and 236 lb ft of torque, with a top speed of 105 mph and a 0-60 mph time of 5.5 seconds. It can run for 20 minutes of aggressive track racing on that battery pack with a full charge, and the hammer-head look of the front end with the exaggerated grill is a damn nice piece of industrial design.

Nissan’s motor department built the engine, which is a prototype not yet used on any kind of production car. It seems mostly made for showing off at the super-fancy Concours D’Elegance, which is some kind of highfalutin car show at Pebble Beach golf course.
Another interesting thing about the Prototype 9 is that it uses steel throughout, from frame to body panels. This is again more of a throwback, especially for an EV, since most modern electric cars favor lighter materials like aluminum to help lower overall body weight and aim for more range.
The car is also completely silent, which is unusual for a race car but not for an EV. Infinity says its design was inspired by Japanese archers, and the silent, speedy arrows that they let loose from their bows.

59,Tesla and GE are installing solar rooftop systems on 50 Home Depots,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/17/tesla-and-ge-are-installing-solar-rooftop-systems-on-50-home-depots/,2017/08/17,"
Tesla’s energy unit is working with GE’s Current to install solar systems on 50 Home Depot locations in the U.S. The installation is part of a plan on Home Depot’s part to move more of its stores to clean power, with a goal of generating 135 megawatts of clean energy from its locations by 2020, Bloomberg reports.
The power generated from the installations will be sold back to Home Depot from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, California and Washington power concerns as part of the deal, and six of the stores will also get Tesla battery storage facilities, which will make use of the company’s commercial Powerpack batteries to keep excess power generated during peak hours in reserve for later use. The installations of solar systems should cut the demand from the stores of the grid by at least one third.
Tesla’s SolarCity has worked on commercial installations of its solar panels for carport and building roofs in the pas. It’s doing more with its energy division post-acquistion, including building battery storage systems to support a number of different renewable power generation facilities around the world.

60,The new DeLorean is all about flying cars,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/14/the-new-delorean-is-all-about-flying-cars/,2017/08/14,"
The DeLorean name is iconic thanks largely to Back to the Future, in which one of the original automaker’s cars was turned into a time machine by ‘Doc’ Emmett Brown. Now, the original DeLorean founder’s nephew is working on making flying cars a reality, with his own aerospace company.
Paul DeLorean’s DeLorean aerospace isn’t actually aiming to exactly replicate the scene from Back to the Future in which the time machine takes off as an airborne vehicle. But it is trying to create a vertical take-off and landing craft (VTOL) that would be able to operate in a roughly similar manner, and it’s hoping to have a full-sized prototype ready within a year’s time, according to Wired.

DeLorean’s first aircraft is called the DR-7 VTOL, and it looks like something out of a much more modern sci-fi film. There are two turbines for propulsion, as well as a two-seat cockpit about mid-body. The plan is to make it a fully electric vehicle, and DeLorean has already completed two small-scale models, including a one-third scale engineering model.
Eventually, the hope is to build a final piloted craft that can travel for 120 miles on a full charge, with a body length of 20 feet and a width of 18.5 across the sides stretch of its wingspan. The range is the biggest challenge and its potential standout point among the competition, given that other prototype designs have much shorter projected ranges.

61,Tesla’s ‘tiny house’ hits the road in Australia to show off solar power potential,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/14/teslas-tiny-house-hits-the-road-in-australia-to-show-off-solar-power-potential/,2017/08/14,"
Tesla has a new way to demonstrate the possibilities of its home solar products to potential customers – using a ‘tiny house’ on wheels, which it can tow on a rolling tour with a Tesla Model X. The Tesla Tiny House made its official debut in Australia (via Electrek), where it will welcome visitors at Melbourne’s Federation Square, before taking off for a cross-country Australian tour.
The towable Tiny House is reminiscent of the mobile design studio it introduced last September, which was a reconfigured Airstream that let people build their own Tesla vehicle as a kind of mobile virtual studio. These solar-focused demonstration trailers also feature mobile design studios and configurators within, but for Tesla’s solar products, including solar panels and its Powerwall energy storage battery for the home.
The Tiny House has actual siding this time around, which is made up of sustainable timber with not artificial chemical treatments. It weighs 2 tonnes (around 4,400 pounds) and has 2kW solar generation capacity using 6 panels, which can feed the single Powerwall battery mounted on the side.

Tesla’s touring the country with destinations at ever major Australian city, but residents can also request it swing by and pay a visit to smaller towns along the way, too. Tesla doesn’t yet offer solar installations in Australia, but it clearly wants to prime the pump, and it does sell Powerwall batteries for use with solar installations from other providers.
This model seems likely to be applied to other markets, too, should the Tiny House prove effective in swaying Australian customers. On the commercial side, Tesla is also building a huge renewable power storage facility using its Powerpack batteries, which will be the largest such facility in the world once it’s complete.

62,Faraday Future signs lease on new turn-key manufacturing facility,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/07/faraday-future-signs-lease-on-new-turn-key-manufacturing-facility/,2017/08/07,"
Faraday Future recently abandoned plans to build its own tailor-made factory from scratch in Nevada, and now it’s signed a lease on a new ready-made production facility in Hanford, Calif. The switch in strategy reflects a broader shift in the electric carmaker’s approach, which has been scaled down for earlier ambitious and lofty goals based on the company’s economic realities.
Faraday Future says the new factory, which it hopes to move into fully by November once the existing tenant departs (it was a Pirelli plant previously) should be ready to help deliver the first production FF 91 vehicles to customers by the end of 2018. Faraday unveiled the FF 91 at a splashy launch event at CES in January, which featured a reveal presided over by LeEco CEO Jia Yueting.
Despite his prominence at the event, Faraday Future is now downplaying their ties to the embattled CEO and his flailing company, which appears to be on the brink of economic collapse. In an interview with Roadshow, Faraday CFO and COO Stefan Krause said there is “no legal relationship with LeEco,” and explained that should that one-time backer go under, Faraday will remain solvent.
Still, the company needs to raise and raise big to keep things on track: It’s seeking $1 billion in fresh funding to continue its development and production plans. Financial challenges are nothing new for upstart automakers, however, and rival Tesla had to overcome similar hurdles to bring its own cars to market.
Still, there are signs that Faraday is in a very tenuous spot at the moment, and the new production plant lease looks like an attempt to demonstrate some kind of stability and path to shipping amid that chaos.

Toyota has agreed to purchase a five percent stake in Mazda, and will build a joint plant in the U.S. worth $1.6 billion, the automaker revealed today. Toyota also said it’s going to increase its investment in “crucial fields” related to the future of automotive technology, including self-driving, artificial intelligence and green vehicle tech.
The automaker’s greater emphasis on tech investment and R&D is a direct result of pressure from new entrants into transportation including Google, Apple and Amazon, Toyota President Akio Toyoda told press at a conference in Tokyo on Friday, according to Bloomberg.
Last month, Toyota claimed to be nearing a breakthrough in solid state battery tech that could extend the life and charge capacity of electric vehicles, and it’s also been looking to build out its expertise and product strength in ADAS and connectivity. At CES this year, Toyota also demonstrated a concept vehicle that entered around an onboard artificial intelligence smart assistant that helps the driver inside and out of the vehicle.
Toyota’s R&D spending in those “crucial” areas including AI and green energy cars is raising from 20 to 25 percent, and the joint plant will aim to be online by 2021, with a production capacity of 300,000 per year.

64,Tesloop does emission-free electric freight shipping – with a Tesla Model X,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/03/tesloop-does-emission-free-electric-freight-shipping-with-a-tesla-model-x/,2017/08/03,"
Tesloop is a company that saw great potential in the Model X from Tesla – not as a consumer vehicle, but as a means of providing city to city fleet passenger transport, similar to a train or bus with added comfort and style, and with all the benefits of sustainable electric transit. Tesloop just completed its first novel use of the Tesla Model X in another capacity: As a freight vehicle, with plans this month to tow 3,500 lbs of water from a 7-UP bottling station in Modesto, CA, to Tesloop’s Culver City headquarters.
This isn’t the main business model for Tesloop, either now or in the future; it’s still focused supplementing long-distance transit with low passenger Model X personal transit, with round-trip routes throughout Southern California, and with plans to begin service to Santa Barbara next, along with pilot routes in the Bay Area.
Still, it’s a unique demonstration and a move that Tesloop says is “the first step in creating an emissions-free supply chain” that can be used more broadly. Basically, the company wanted to show that it could be done to get the ball rolling on how different transit models can be reimagined today, using technology that’s already on the road.
It’s also a marketing move for Tesloop, which is working with Noah’s Spring Water on the shipment, and which will also be offering Noah’s Water onboard its Tesloop routes as one of the many free snacks and amenities it offers to paying passengers during their trips. Other onboard features include Wi-Fi, noise-cancelling headphones and pillows.
Tesla will unveil its own electric semi truck in September, which will probably be a better way to transport sizeable cargo to and from different destinations with minimal ecological impact. For now, though, maybe strap a trailer to that Model X – plus, those gull-wing doors are perfect for loading large packages.

Tesla has already completed the first installations of its Solar Roof products, which use integrated solar panels to gather energy. The solar tiles were first introduced last year, and are designed to look essentially indistinguishable from traditional roofing materials so that they present an aesthetically attractive option to consumers who might shy away from traditional panel designs.
The first installations have been made on Tesla employee homes, which mirrors the way it’s distributing the very first Tesla Model 3 automobiles. This is partly a reward for their contribution to the immense effort represented by bringing these things to market, but it’s also likely a strategic decision that allows Tesla to test and monitor its new products early on in their production life.
“I have it on my house, [Tesla co-founder] JB [Straubel] has it on his house,” Elon Musk said on the call. He specified that the first installations were already generating energy as well as being installed.
Tesla started pre-orders for Solar Roof installations during Q2, and is offering a warranty for the lifetime of the house on which they’re installed, “or infinity, whichever comes first.”

66,Solar cell lenses give these shades a charge,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/02/solar-cell-lenses-give-these-shades-a-charge/,2017/08/02,"
Over the years I’ve seen concepts of solar-powered sunglasses come and go, but the dream of for some reason wearing solar panels on my face has remained elusive — until today. Genius engineers at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology have successfully made a pair of shades with organic solar cell lenses — and you don’t even have to stare directly at the sun for them to work.
The lenses have been cut like ordinary glass or plastic to fit in a commercial frame, and are similarly light and transparent. Organic solar cells aren’t particularly efficient, but they are flexible and versatile, able to be put in situations where a rigid, opaque cell isn’t an option.
“The Solar Glasses we developed are an example of how organic solar cells may be employed in applications that would not be feasible with conventional photovoltaics,” said Dominik Landerer, a PhD student at KIT who worked on the project, in a news release from the school.

Each arm of the sunglasses houses a custom PCB that converts the current and uses it to run, in this case, two small displays that show temperature and brightness. Not sure why you’d need a display to tell you how bright it is out there, but hey, it’s a research project.
After supplying the displays, the cells generate about 200 milliwatts of excess power. That’s not going to do much for your phone, but it will run or trickle charge a low-power device like a step counter, wireless transmitter or small speaker. They work in dimmer light, too, like that of a home or office. In this case there isn’t even a battery in the assembly — it’s all accomplished with the energy collected in real time.
The researchers envision more interesting applications as the technology and manufacturing methods mature. They’ve published their methods in the journal Energy Technology.

Ikea is getting into the domestic solar power generation and storage market in the UK, with new solar panel and home storage battery system products. The products include panels that integrated with existing roofing solutions provided by Solarcentury, a UK solar power company, which includes a 25 year guarantee on the panels themselves, as well as s six-year warranty on installation and every aspect of the system hardware.
The installations cost more than your average self-assemble coffee table, with prices beginning at the equivalent of just under $4,000 U.S. The battery storage component can work with the solar panel offerings provided by Ikea and Solarcentury, but are also offered standalone as add-ons for existing home solar installations. Those batteries will help boost solar usage rates as a fraction of total energy consumption for UK home owners, Ikea says, allowing the average home equipped with solar power generation to achieve nearly 80 percent solar usage.
Ikea entering the solar power market puts it in company with dedicated providers like Tesla, which offers home solar generation and storage solutions through its acquired subsidiary SolarCity, and via its Tesla Powerwall home battery storage product.
Ikea may not be offering a DIY solar solution like it does with its furniture assembly, but it is trying to make the process uncomplicated, which is in keeping with its broader mission. The home furnishings retailer says it’ll provide potential customers with everything they need to go solar as quickly as possible including a free quotation, a home survey, quotation approval and final installation.
If this takes off, it seems likely Ikea will look to expand the model elsewhere. That could mean partnering with different providers in different regions, so this could end up being an opportunity for home solar market expansion much more broadly across the ecosystem if things pan out.

69,Offshore U.S. wind farm proposal uses Tesla batteries to store power,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/01/offshore-u-s-wind-farm-proposal-uses-tesla-batteries-to-store-power/,2017/08/01,"
Tesla’s energy business is focused in part on solar power generation, but a big component of the business hopes to use its Powerpack commercial storage batteries in tandem with renewable power generation to store energy until it’s needed. A new proposal, reports Bloomberg, by energy supplier Deepwater Wind would use Tesla’s batteries in a new offshore wind plant near Massachusetts for exactly that purpose.
The plan, which is one of the bids submitted to a request for proposals to supply power to the state of Massachusetts, would see a production facility with 144-megawatt capability build off the coast. The batteries from Tesla would then store the wind-generated energy at peak production times, and hold it in reserve for peak demand hours. It’s exactly how other Tesla Powerpack facilities function, including its Kauai energy storage installation, which opened earlier this year.
The proposed plan includes a 40-megawatt storage capacity, which is less than either 52 MWh facility on Kauai, or the planned 100 KWh set for construction in Australia. But the unique offshore installation would add yet another example of how Tesla’s battery storage can supplement a range of power generation methods, which would help with its larger goal of demonstrating how it can be applied to a wide variety of requirements.
Deepwater will still have to compete with other bids, but it’s already built the first ever U.S. offshore wind farm near Rhode Island.

70,Alphabet’s X lab is working on renewable energy storage,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/31/alphabets-x-lab-is-working-on-renewable-energy-storage/,2017/07/31,"
Storing the energy produced from renewable sources is a significant challenge, and one that a number of players, including Tesla, are looking to address. Add Alphabet’s X (formerly Google X) to the list of those making an attempt: Its new Malta project is focused on building storage facilities that can support full-scale power grids.
The Malta project, described by Bloomberg, uses cold antifreeze and hot salt to store power, in a system designed to keep power in reserve for longer than lithium-ion batteries, which are what Tesla uses to keep its power using the commercial-scale Powerpack stations that populate installations like its Kauai-based facility.
Malta is another “moonshot” from the ambitious X lab, which also spawned initiatives like the self-driving car project at Google that became Alphabet, as well as Google Glass. It’s also been looking at a few different energy-focused projects, but Malta seems one of the more promising.
Here’s how it works: Two tanks get filled up with salt, and another two are filled with antifreeze (or a similar hydrocarbon liquid), and then the system takes in electricity generated by renewable sources like wind or solar. This is converted into both hot and cold air, which heats up the salt and cools down the antifreeze. Then, the process is reversed, with hot and cold air pushed towards each other and resulting in gusts of wind that move a turbine, generating usable electricity again for the grid.
This kind of thing is needed because renewable generation has typically had trouble dealing with peak and off hours of power consumption. A fuel-based power generation facility can spin up when the grid needs the power on-demand; solar and wind generate when nature makes it possible to do so, and the schedules don’t necessary line up with human use.
Rather than just discarding excess energy, and falling short during off-peak times, storage solutions like Malta and Tesla’s Powerpack allow generation at peak generation times, and distribution at peak consumption times. As governments and utilities globally look to invest more in renewable power generation, storage will be an increasingly valuable commodity.

Toyota is touting its progress on a new kind of battery technology, which uses a solid electrolyte instead of the conventional semi-liquid version used in today’s lithium-ion batteries. The car maker said that it’s near a breakthrough in production engineering that could help it put the new tech in production electric vehicles as early as 2020, according to the Wall Street Journal.
The improved battery technology would make it possible to create smaller, more lightweight lithium-ion batteries for use in EVs, that could also potentially boost the total charge capacity and result in longer-range vehicles.
Another improvement for this type of battery would be longer overall usable life, which would make it possible to both use the vehicles they’re installed in for longer, and add potential for product recycling and alternative post-vehicle life (some companies are already looking into putting EV batteries into use in home and commercial energy storage, for example).
Batteries remain a key limiting factor for electric vehicle design, because of how far tech companies focused on the problem have pushed existing science. The move to solid state would help make room for more gains in terms of charge capacity achieved in the footprint available in consumer vehicles, while helping to push further existing efficiencies achieved through things like the use of ultra-light materials in car frames and interiors.
Toyota isn’t saying yet where its batteries will end up, but any edge here is bound to be a big boon for automakers looking at a future that increasingly seems like it’ll be dominated by EVs.

BMW Group today revealed more information about its forthcoming battery electric Mini car, which will join the existing internal combustion and hybrid options as a pillar of the lineup. The all-electric model will be a “variant of the brand’s core 3 door model,” BMW revealed for the first time today, and will enter production in 2019 alongside the rest of the Mini lineup.
The electric Mini’s drivetrain will be supplied by the company’s Landshut and Dingolfing plans in Bavaria, and they’ll be assembled with the rest of the vehicle at the main production plan in Oxford. The plan for BMW is part of its overarching strategy of developing a flexible vehicle structure that will make it possible to electrify every vehicle series in its lineup.
While BMW’s electrification roadmap extends well beyond 2020, in the immediate future the new Mini will be joined by a MBW i8 Roadster in 2018, and an all-electric X3 starting in 2020. The plug-in Mini Countryman variant is the latest in its overall alternative powertrain range of offerings.
No word yet on further details regarding the all-electric Mini, but expect more to be available soon since that 2019 production timeline is not all that far off in terms of automaker manufacturing timelines.

Tesla has added two new independent directors to its board, including 21st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch and Johnson Publishing Company CEO and Chairman Linda Johnson Rice. The two new board members were added just a few months after Tesla confirmed it was seeking additional independent directors without ties to CEO and founder Elon Musk.
Until now, Tesla’s board included five (of six total directors, prior to these additions) people with either personal or professional ties to Musk. A group of powerful investors in the company, including the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, issued a letter to the company in April asking for the addition of two new independent members without direct ties to Musk.
Musk said at the time that Tesla had already been planning to announce two new independent board members, ever since its acquisition of SolarCity, the solar power company founded by Musk’s cousins. Musk said via Twitter in April that the activist shareholder group had “nothing to do” with the decision to appoint these directors.


Besides, I already said we'd add more independent members during SCTY merger. Will announce soon, but this group has nothing to do with it.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 12, 2017



The same investor group also asked for annual elections for board directors, a proposal which was failed at the company’s annual shareholder meeting in June.
The new board members are very interesting additions – James Murdoch is the younger son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, the driving force behind News Corp’s media empire, which includes prominent newspapers like the Wall Street Journal. James previously acted as News Corp’s Europe and Asia CEO, too, prior to taking over leadership of 21st Century Fox, one of two spin-outs of the original News Corporation focused primarily on film and television. James claims an “instrumental” role in 21st Century Fox’s “decade-long leadership on environmental sustainability” in his Tesla board member bio.
Linda Johnson Rice is also CEO of Ebony Media Operations, and retains an emeritus chairman role at Ebony Media Holdings, the company which oversees both the EBONY and Jet brands, meaning both the new independent directors have media industry experience. In addition to Tesla’s board, Johnson Rice has served on a number of others, including current director roles with Omnicom Group and Grouphub. In 2016, Johnson Publishing Company sold Ebony and Jet to Clear View Group (which formed Ebony Media Holdings), while retaining ownership of its Fashion Fair cosmetics brand and photography archives.

It’s here: The first ever production Model 3 has rolled off Tesla’s assembly line and into the possession of its owner – Elon Musk. The founder and CEO tweeted pictures of the new vehicle, which he only got because the actual first pre-order customer gifted Musk his place in the queue as a birthday present.
Alongside the pics, Musk tweeted an interesting bit of trivia about who gets dibs on the first edition of any new Tesla car: It’s the first person who pays full price for the vehicle. Musk earned that honor for the Roadster and Model X, but not for the Model S, he noted.

This first production Model 3 is black, a good callback to the original Model T from Ford, which famously came in any color you wanted as long as it was black. The Model 3 will have more paint options, but it’s one of the very few things customers will be able to customize on the vehicle, as Tesla is limiting options early to ease the production process.
As expected based on prototype models and early spy shots of the car, it basically looks like a shorter Model S, but with a similar sporty feel for a four-door sedan. Musk’s big reveal didn’t go long on technical details, however, so we’re still waiting on some of that info, including the exact range beyond the minimum 215 mile spec, for example.
Tesla noted recently that its first customers beyond Musk can expect deliveries to start around July 28, so that’s the date to look for more info.
Bonus: here is another new photo of the Model 3.

Tesla will up its game in the renewable energy storage market with the largest lithium-ion battery storage facility in the world, to be built for Australia’s Hornsdale Wind Farm, with a completion date of December 1, 2017. The facility will use Tesla’s commercial battery storage Powerpack modules to deliver a capacity of 100 MW/129 MWh, which will store energy generated from the farm’s turbines during peak generation hours, and make it available consistently throughout the day when the grid needs it.
This system will be able to power around 30,000 homes at max capacity, which Tesla says is equivalent to how many were without power during a storm that caused a state-wide blackout in South Australia in 2016. The real goal, however, is to help stabilize the South Australian electric power grid, by controlling power delivery according to peak demand. Tesla adds that its Powerwall home battery storage devices are also being installed for residential customers in the country, which can further aid with grid stabilization.
Tesla has already built a large-scale energy storage facility for the Hawaiian island of Kauai, and at the system’s opening Tesla co-founder and CTO JB Straubel explained to me that Powerpack-based systems had potential for applications across renewable energy generation methods, beyond just solar. This wind-based installation, combined with its scale, is another signal to the world that Tesla’s energy offerings can fit a range of needs.

France’s environmental plan also includes instituting a carbon tax, and ending the issuance of new licenses for discovering new local sources of oil. They’ll also incentivize renewable energy creation, according to Engadget, which should help make sure that EVs are powered by a grid that itself is mostly stocked by green energy sources, for a cleaner power picture at the macro level.
Like London Mayor Sadiq Khan’s plan to make transport in the city totally emission free by 2050, this is a plan at this stage, not anything binding. But France’s government has the power to back it up with legislation given time, so during this administration at least, expect these plans to start resulting in some action.

77,BMW’s i3 battery now being used for Torqeedo’s electric boat motors,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/05/bmws-i3-battery-now-being-used-for-torqeedos-electric-boat-motors/,2017/07/05,"
BMW’s i3 high-capacity batteries, which it uses in its i3 compact electric vehicle, has applications beyond BMW’s own – case in point, the car maker is now supplying German boat propulsion system company Torqeedo with i3 batteries for its Deep Blue aquatic electric drive systems.
The Torqeedo systems provide motorboats with hybrid and electric propulsion ranging from 1 to 160 HP in capacity, and BMW says the adoption of its tech by the company is a testament to its ability to produce high voltage batteries for a range of applications in transport efficiency. The current version of the i3 battery has 44kWh capacity, providing 50 more charge with the same size and weight of the previous generation.

BMW designed i3 batteries to have ‘plug-and-play’ functionality, with in-house connectors, cables, sensors and temperature control systems in addition to the 12 cells found in each of the battery’s eight modules. The automaker intended from the outset to make the batteries usable in a range of different applications, including, for example, as energy storage in commercial power generation, where they can be useful even after they’ve passed their usable life in terms of powering vehicles.
A recent study found that the electric boat market would be worth $20 billion by 2027, so this is a market with huge growth potential for BMW, and Torqeedo is a partner that can help adapt their tech to a wide range of nautical applications.

78,Volvo will only make electric and hybrid cars starting in 2019,https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/05/volvo-will-only-make-electric-and-hybrid-cars-starting-in-2019/,2017/07/05,"
Volvo is done with entirely traditional engines and exclusively gas-powered vehicles, the company announced. By 2019, Volvo group intends to offer only either fully electric or hybrid engines on all new models, making it the first automaker to commit to using only alternative drive trains.
The end of the solely combustion engine-powered car did seem like an eventual inevitability, given the advantages of electric and hybrid from a manufacturing and performance standpoint, and given the industry’s heavy investment in autonomous vehicle tech. But for Volvo to commit to going entirely hybrid and electric just two years from now is still the strongest sign yet we’ve seen that the purely combustion engine’s days might be numbered sooner, rather than later.
Volvo already had a target sales figure of 1 million electric and hybrid cars by 2025, and now that target seems well within reach given it’s all it’ll be selling in terms of new vehicles. Volvo also announced it would launch five new electric and hybrid cars between 2019 and 2021, and that two of those will be made by Polestar, which the company recently announced would become its own subsidiary and brand selling performance EVs, likely to compete with high-end Tesla models.
Part of the cost benefit of making electric cars is dealing with ever stronger emissions requirements on vehicles, which are set to tighten in most key international markets, including China, which is where Volvo’s owner Geely is based. Production costs of EV parts and batteries are also getting smaller, as capacity and manufacturing processes improve.
Volvo getting a jump on the move to electric, with hybrids included as a transitional stopgap, is a smart and aggressive play for claiming a leadership position in the market of the future. A lot of companies talk about their work with, and commitment to alternative drivetrains, but this is really putting your money where you mouth is.

Swedish tech startup Einride has built a full-scale prototype of its T-Pod, the electric autonomous transport vehicle it hopes will eventually replace smaller heavy-duty trucks, featuring remote control operation and a 200 kWh energy capacity with a maximum range of around 124 miles.
The Einride T-Pod is unique in its design, as you can see, but it’s designed from the ground up for remote human operation and driverless functioning, meaning you don’t need the traditional crew cabin, and can instead build a vehicle tailor-made exclusively for transporting goods efficiently. The T-Pod will be put into service first in a route between Gothenburg and Helsingborg by 2020 in Sweden, with 200 T-Pods traveling the route, which will be outfitted with charging stations.

The overall T-Pod network will be able to move up to 2,000,000 pallets of goods per year, which Einride says will have roughly the CO2 emissions equivalent of 400,000 passenger cars traveling the equivalent distance. Einride also says it might expand the route even farther earlier than planned, given the strength of client demand.
These T-Pods are an interesting alternative to autonomous retrofit and conversion of semi trucks. The remote control mechanism is also interesting, and Einride says it adds “human flexibility and decision-making” alongside the vehicle’s autonomous capabilities, with one driver able to control multiple T-Pods at once.

80,"Tesla delivered 22K vehicles in Q2, 47K in the first half of 2017",https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/03/tesla-delivered-22k-vehicles-in-q2-47k-in-the-first-half-of-2017/,2017/07/03,"
Tesla has delivered 22,000 cars during the second quarter of 2017, the company revealed today. That includes 12,000 Model S vehicles and 10,000 Model X SUVs, adding up to a 53 percent increase over its delivery numbers for the same period in 2016.
In total across Q1 and Q2 2017, Tesla delivered 47,100 cars, which is on track to beat its 76,000 deliveries for 2016. Tesla’s second-quarter deliveries were hamstrung by a shortage of 100kWh batteries, the company says, which are created using new production-line tech and facilities, leading to new challenges. Tesla says production fell short of demand by roughly 40 percent up until early June, but after that, it managed to deliver the best performance (in terms of both orders and deliveries) in the company’s history.
Tesla says its Model S and Model X deliveries in the second half of 2017 will exceed those made during the first half, and production in Q2 totaled 25,708 cars. Tesla also says that it has added a significant number of test and display Model X cars, as some of its showroom facilities apparently had none at all. The company also notes that production has improved dramatically on Model X, to the point where it “rarely” shows “initial quality problems” on new cars off the line.
Tesla’s deliveries total represents all cars delivered physically to the customer, with all paperwork completed successfully. The company also just announced that it will begin shipping Model 3 to its first 30 or so customers beginning July 28, with the first certified production vehicles being completed by this Friday.

81,View raises $200M for their electrochromic smart glass,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/27/view-raises-200m-for-their-electrochromic-smart-glass/,2017/06/27,"
When you hear about companies raising tons of money for “smart glass,” the first thing that hits your mind might be something augmented reality-related like the HoloLens.
But View, which just closed a $200 million funding round after securing $70 million from BlackRock alongside an earlier investment from TIAA, is using smart glass to make better windows that adjust to the outdoor environment.
The internet-connected windows can be made more or less transparent via a smartphone app, eliminating the need for blinds. The windows also can automatically adjust based on weather conditions so that they are ready when the beating sun comes out or you’re trying to make the most of your natural light during a more cloudy day.
Putting the production pipelines in place to put smart glass on 20 million square feet worth of buildings is expensive; this raise puts the company’s total up to nearly $650 million in disclosed funding.
“Our demand has gone up significantly where we are now production-limited as a company,” CEO Rao Mulpuri told TechCrunch. “This funding is to drive that growth that we are seeing.”
Mulpuri believes that people’s windows will see more and more tech get stuffed into them in the next several decades, and says View is already researching what’s next, like embedding transparent displays into their windows.
The company is focusing the majority of its efforts on North American markets. Most recently, it was announced that more than 66,000 square feet of View’s dynamic glass will be used for the redesign of Terminal 1 at SFO airport. The company has 150 commercial installations in process and has finished more than 350 projects.

Volvo tuner Polestar, which the carmaker acquired in 2015 to build its own race-ready Volve cars, is now being set up as its own separate company within the Volvo group, with a new focus on performance electric vehicles. The new Polestar will have its own branding, distinct from Volvo’s – though it’ll still produce performance versions of Volvo cars in addition to its own models, Slashgear reports.
The new Polestar will build its own EVs, as mentioned, but the focus will still be on making these attractive to those in the market for high-performance vehicles. This could put the new Volvo subsidiary in direct competition with Tesla and its Model S, currently the easy first choice for those looking for a vehicle that has both an all-electric drivetrain and the ability to deliver track-topping speed, acceleration and handling.
We’ll find out more about what exactly Polestar has planned for its own vehicles this fall, the company says, which could coincide with a bunch of announcements from Tesla, too, since that’s roughly when it says it’ll reveal its electric semi-truck plans. Musk has been dropping hints that an updated Roadster reveal is in the works, too, and noted that we should expect some surprises at the September truck event, so maybe fall will be a very interesting season for performance EV fans.

83,Mayor of London’s plan for city transport aims for zero emissions by 2050,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/21/mayor-of-londons-plan-for-city-transport-aims-for-zero-emissions-by-2050/,2017/06/21,"
London could be a lot more green by 2050 – Mayor Sadiq Khan has outlined a plan for transportation service (via Engadget) in the city that would make the whole system, including taxis, cars and buses, totally emission free by that year. Even though that’s over 30 years away, it’s still an incredibly ambitious plan that will require a lot of pieces to fall into place.
Those pieces are also taken into consideration, as Khan’s “Transport Strategy” draft describes how this would include stages like making all taxis and for-hire private vehicles zero-emission “capable” as of 2033, then buses and all other road vehicles meeting that same standard by 2033 and 2040 respectively.
Also included in the plan are staged introduction of emission-free city zones, which start small in 2025 and grow eventually to cover the whole city. And the plan isn’t just about encouraging emissions-free cars; Khan suggests walking, cycling and public transit should grow from making up 64 percent of in-city transport today, to 80 percent by 2041. That alone would help with the metrics.
This isn’t a plan that’s set in stone or binding at this stage by any means, but it’s an interesting sign of where regulators and top city officials are thinking in terms of ensuring cities remain livable as they swell and grow even more densely populated.

Tesla’s next Gigafactory could be in China, according to a report from Bloomberg. The electric car maker is in talks to build its vehicles in the country for the first time, and it’s nearing an agreement with the city of Shanghai to construct the manufacturing facility in a nearby industrial development zone.
The final details of the agreement are still in flux, and Bloomberg says timing about when it’ll be made official could still change. Tesla will also need to partner up with a local automaker to create a joint venture in the company, as other automakers entering local production from overseas have done, in keeping with local requirements.
A local presence could be a huge boon for Tesla, which is seeing big growth in its business in the country. Currently, Model S and Model X vehicles bought in the country face a 25 percent import tax, and as Tesla expands its business to more affordable market segments, sidestepping that tax with local assembly facilities will be key.
China also has aggressive targets and incentives for vehicle electrification, which could help Tesla with its larger global goals. Back in March, Tesla also received investment from Tencent, which acquired a five percent stake in the energy co. for $1.8 billion – that could help it pave the way for  heightened local footprint, too.
Elon Musk has said that Tesla is looking at new global locations for Gigafactories, and could announce as many as four new spots for the gigantic manufacturing facilities within the next year.

85,Lyft sets goal of 1 billion autonomous electric rides per year by 2025,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/15/lyft-sets-goal-of-1-billion-autonomous-electric-rides-per-year-by-2025/,2017/06/15,"
Lyft has set itself some concrete goals for its renewed commitment to the Paris climate agreement, in spite of Trump’s announcement that the U.S. as a nation would be pulling out of the accord. Those goals focus primarily on Lyft’s autonomous ambitions, and so are contingent on the ride hailing company accomplishing its self-driving vision at scale, but they’re laudable goals nonetheless.
The targets Lyft has set include powering 100 percent of the autonomous electric vehicles using its platform in the future from 100 percent renewable energy – starting from day one, which means beginning with the couple of cars Lyft is fielding in partnership with Nutonomy on Boston streets starting a little later on this year. Lyft announced that it would be running some Renault Zoe electric cars outfitted with Nutonomy’s autonomous vehicle tech earlier this month.
Lyft is also seeking to provide at minimum 1 billion rides per year via electric autonomous vehicles by 2025. That’s a tall order, given that Lyft provided 160 million rides in 2016, the company revealed at the beginning of this year. A minimum of 1 billion rides in 2025, solely from autonomous electric vehicles, envisions dramatic, sustained, year-over-year growth between now and then.
Finally, Lyft says it will reduce CO2 emissions across the U.S. transportation sector by at minimum 5 million tons annually by 2025, which sounds like a reasonable result provided it manages to achieve the above ride numbers.
These are all goals that seem to rely heavily on Lyft making good on its plans to combine autonomous and electrification trends with a wide range of automaker and self-driving company partnerships to maximize its reach. It’ll also require driverless tech to continue to develop, to accelerate its advent and to be received smoothly by regulators, all of which seem like optimistic goals. Eight years can seem like a long time in some contexts, but as a timeframe for a change this dramatic, it seems like no time at all.

London’s Mayor Sadiq Khan has announced a clean tech incubator aimed at sparking a new startup cluster in the UK capital focused on helping to foster the development of low-carbon and clean-tech products which are aimed at tackling the causes and effects of climate change.
Among the issues the mayor wants London-based businesses to contribute ideas and ingenuity towards improving include air pollution, housing and the future of transport.
London’s air quality has been generating bad headlines for years — and tackling pollution is an area Khan has pledged to prioritize as mayor.

“The potential for cutting-edge technology to tackle a host of social, economic and environmental challenges is immeasurable. From air pollution and climate change to housing and transport, new technologies and data science will be at the heart of the long-term solutions to urban challenges,” said Khan in a statement today.
The £1.6M incubator, which is being called Better Futures and is part-funded by the European Regional Development Fund, will support 100 London-based clean tech small businesses, including with leadership and management support, access to co-working space and business support in areas such as marketing, supply chain and product development.
Some of the startups will also be offered research collaboration — with Imperial College London being one of the partner organizations for the initiative, via its Centre for Cleantech Innovation, which aims to support the development of a new economy based on low-carbon and resilient businesses.
Sustainable business incubator, Sustainable Bridges, is another partner of the project.
It’s not yet clear when the incubator will begin accepting applications from startups, nor over what time period the money will be portioned out to successful applicants. We’ve reached out with questions and will update this post with any response.
Startups interested in applying for the Better Futures incubator can register their interest here.
As well as seeking to spark clean tech startup activity directly, the Better Futures project will also target enterprises with support for 50 to develop innovations that have the potential to save green-house gas emissions, and support for 25 enterprises to design, develop and introduce new products to the firm — with up to 10 “new innovations” set to be trialled as part of the program.

Elon Musk couldn’t help but include some teasers in his Tesla shareholder meeting address on Tuesday, reiterating that the company would be holding a special event to reveal its Semi Truck at the end of September, but noting also that he would “really recommend showing up” for the event because “maybe there’s a little more than we’re saying here.”
The truck should be news enough – Musk said he believes it’s very possible for the company to create a practical, all-electric semi truck that will fit the needs of large freight trucking companies. He also said that Tesla is talking to those potential clients throughout the design process, so that the vehicle will be tailor-made for their needs once it comes to market.
He said that the response from most people they show their work on the project to in the industry has been “How many can we buy and how soon,” and added that what we’ll see in September at the unveil will be a “working prototype.” He also added that he expects Tesla to be able to achieve production at scale on the semi within “about two years,” or possibly even 18 months.
The comments around wha else to expect at the event made it seem like Tesla will have other news to share totally unrelated from the vehicle itself, however. Musk was coy about the additional news, but did take a tangent later on to talk about music in response to a question about his own musical tastes. He said that it’s currently “very hard to find good playlists or good matching algorithms” in music, and said Tesla will have an announcement about finding the right music later this year.
It didn’t sound like that was the special additional reveal coming at the semi truck event, but as always, it’s hard to tell with Musk. Still, it sounds like September will be big for Tesla – 18 wheels big, sure, but maybe even bigger still.

Henrik Fisker, who’s been teasing his new electric vehicle company after a stutter step first attempt with the original Fisker co. and the Karma, is back with the EMotion, the first car from Fisker Inc. The EMotion gets its first official eyes-on today via photos, not renders, that show us the vehicle in the aluminum and carbon fiber, finally.
The car also gets its official pricing for the first time: $129,900 to start, which is in line with the ‘north of $100K’ pricing info we’d been hearing. That price includes an “ultra-large” battery pack, which makes possible its 400+ mile electric range, and upper speed of 161 mph.
Fisker Inc. still isn’t looking to ship this car before 2019, but as you can see, it’s come a long way in terms of industrial design. Pre-orders kick off on June 30, too, with more details to be revealed this month in order to drum up interest from those willing to put down some early cash.
Here’s what we do know about the car now, from the company itself: It’s built using carbon fiber and aluminum, has a patented, unique “frontal crash structure” designed to boost safety, uses carbon fiber and aluminum wheels for decreased mass and higher range, and uses patented fast charge tech to achieve 100 miles of range in nine minutes. It also has a healthy selection on onboard sensors, including LiDAR and mirror cameras that enable 360-degree optical sensing. Fisker is teaming up with The Hybrid Shop to offer customers white glove service, too, the company says.

Danish-born Fisker originally helped design a range of iconic cars including the Aston Martin DB9 and V8 Vantage. Fisker’s design firm also contributed to the original design of the Tesla Model S, before he began his own EV company called Fisker Automotive. That company eventually fizzled due to bankruptcy and sold to Chinese auto parts firm Wanxiang, where it was rebranded as Karma Automotive.
Fisker, Inc. is a completely new, separate entity, but it’s hard not to consider its founder’s last attempt at building an EV company when considering its chances. Still, the design chops are solid, so more than a few car and EV buffs out there will be watching to see the Emotion’s full reveal.

89,Evaptainers decouples refrigeration from electricity to help rural farms and families,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/02/evaptainers-decouples-refrigeration-from-electricity-to-help-rural-farms-and-families/,2017/06/02,"
Some 1.4 billion people lack access to electricity worldwide today, most in rural areas across Southeast Asia, China, India and Sub-Saharan Africa, according to data from the OECD.
While others are focused on wiring up those places and developing new energy sources, a startup called Evaptainers has created a kind of refrigerator that requires no electricity, runs instead on water and can keep food and drinks significantly cooler than the temperature outside.
Evaptainers’ co-founders Spencer Taylor, Quang Truong and Jeremy Fryer-Biggs developed their cooling units as a kind of modern take on an analog invention, the “zeer pot,” or pot-in-pot refrigerator. The way these things work is something like sweating.
Evaptainers co-founders: Spencer Taylor, Quang Truong and Jeremy Fryer-Biggs.
Taylor said, “As we sweat, water molecules draw heat out of our bodies to go through a phase-change, and evaporate. As that happens we cool down. This machine has water in a tank, and permeable membranes that deliver water to evaporative walls.”
Each unit of the company’s newest EV-8-model refrigerators requires about 1/3 of a liter of water to operate per day in a place that’s got less than 65 percent humidity on a hot day. They can store 60 liters, about 5 gallons of milk, and chill contents by about 35 degrees Fahrenheit from the ambient air temperature.
To turn on the device, users just pour water into a port on the top of it. The water doesn’t have to be potable. The Evaptainers can be folded up, which makes them portable and easy to transport into rural communities that need them most.
While the company is on a mission to reduce food spoilage in places where sustenance is hard to come by, it is operating as a for-profit, for-good business with five employees in North America and two in North Africa at this time. The company has raised nearly half a million dollars in grant funding to get started.
Evaptainers EV-8 refrigerator is collapsible, and runs on water, not electricity.
Truong told TechCrunch his original idea for the company was inspired by courses that he took at Tufts Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy and MIT, as well as by failed efforts by non-government organizations and philanthropists to feed the world.
The founder said, “With a variety of agriculture projects you’ll see people spending millions to try to build a cold storage warehouse in places were graft, corruption and other issues make it hard to even get something built. But then there’s this issue of what to do if you don’t have a reliable electric system, or grid in the first place. The short answer is to do something that doesn’t require electricity.”
Besides the company’s interest in helping people who live without reliable access to food and electricity, Evaptainers is considering developing a version of its refrigerators for outdoor sports and camping enthusiasts.
“We’d like to do something where the higher margins in the U.S. support our ability to put this technology in the hands of people who wouldn’t be able to pay for poor rural consumers and food producers in emerging markets,” Taylor said.

Unscaling politics




Pulling out of the Paris agreement on climate change will become one of the greatest economic blunders by a U.S. president in our lifetimes.
People can disagree about the scientific premise behind climate change, but it’s an inescapable fact that the world is driving ahead to replace carbon energy with clean energy anyway. That makes advanced energy technologies one of the biggest business opportunities of the next couple of decades. The companies and nations that take the lead will become the next economic superpowers.
President Trump said that he is pulling out of the agreement because it would cost American jobs. But while he might save a relatively small number of coal and oil jobs, he is harming the nation’s chances to create vast numbers of advanced energy jobs. 
Many coal and oil jobs are eventually doomed anyway — those industries have a limited future as the world leaves carbon behind. Advanced energy jobs will multiply year after year. If the U.S. doesn’t capture that work, other nations will.

Companies gain market leadership because they thrive on local markets first and then become global. This is what happened in China with solar panel manufacturing — the government spent heavily to create a local market for the technology.
It pumped $89.5 billion into the industry in 2015 alone, and in January 2017 its National Energy Administration announced it would spend $360 billion through 2020 on renewable energy. As Chinese companies have perfected the process and scaled up manufacturing, they were in position to dominate solar panels around the world. Today the three biggest solar makers are based in China: Trina Solar, JinkoSolar and JA Solar. 
If ending our participation in the Paris Accord slows the U.S. advanced energy market, our American companies will be at a huge competitive disadvantage globally. They won’t have a robust local market to build on. Before long, we will find ourselves buying energy technology from other countries, just as other countries now soak up our digital tech products. 
Worse, the damage can go beyond energy to all U.S. industry. New energy sources aren’t getting adopted just because they might stave off climate change — they’re getting adopted because they are becoming cheaper than carbon-based energy. 
Solar is on a trajectory that echoes Moore’s Law, which explained why computers got twice as powerful for the same price every 18 months for decades. The cost of solar has dropped 95 percent since the 1980s while efficiency has rocketed. And solar farms, with acres of solar panels laid out in a sunny climate, can be the most efficient of all.

With today’s technology, solar panels covering just a few counties in Texas could supply all the electricity needed for the entire United States. In May, California on some days generated 80 percent of the total power used in the state with renewable sources — because it has become cheaper than carbon.
So if the U.S. falls behind in advanced energy and our companies instead rely on carbon, eventually U.S. business will be operating at a higher cost than competitors around the world that rely on clean sources. 
Anticipating Trump’s announcement, in early May, 25 major U.S. companies — including Apple, Facebook, Mars Incorporated and Morgan Stanley — published a full-page letter in several newspapers that read: “By expanding markets for innovative clean technologies, the agreement generates jobs and economic growth. U.S. companies are well positioned to lead in these markets. Withdrawing from the agreement will limit our access to them and could expose us to retaliatory measures.”
 If the U.S. falls behind in advanced energy and our companies instead rely on carbon, eventually U.S. business will be operating at a higher cost than competitors around the world that rely on clean sources.— Hemant Taneja
Competing nations already know that Trump’s actions spell opportunity. Chinese premier Li Keqiang, visiting Germany, said his country would remain committed to combating climate change. 
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker declared: “The vacuum that would be created has to be filled, and Europe has aspirations for a natural leadership in this whole process.”
At least U.S. companies have pushed ahead despite the Trump Administration’s rhetoric. Walmart, which installs solar panels on the rooftops of its stores, announced it intends to operate on 100 percent solar, and Google, which in 2016 consumed as much energy as the whole city of San Francisco, said that by the end of 2017 all its data centers globally will run entirely on renewable energy.
The best news about Trump’s action is that it will take four years to get out of the Paris Accord, so the final decision would land about the time of the next presidential election. Between now and then, U.S. industry has to send a clear message: our economic future lies in leading the world away from carbon. Otherwise, we will surely wind up as followers.

91,Elon Musk leaving Trump advisory councils following Paris agreement withdrawal,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/01/elon-musk-leaving-trump-advisory-councils-following-paris-agreement-withdrawal/,2017/06/01,"
Elon Musk is making good on his promise to leave President Trump’s White House advisory councils, he said today on Twitter. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO promised Wednesday he would step down from his official advisory roles with the administration should Trump go through with his plan to leave the Paris Climate Accord. Trump announced the U.S. would be removing itself form the agreement on Thursday.


Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017



Musk cited climate change and the downsides of leaving the Paris agreement both for the world and for the U.S. as his reasoning. The prolific tech entrepreneur said previously that he has attempted to convince the President to support of the Paris agreement, through his council involvement and through White House connections.
Prior to this decision, Musk served on Trump’s economic advisory board, as well as his manufacturing jobs initiative council. He’s received criticism from supporters for his close relationship with the administration in the past, particularly in the face of Trump’s executive order on immigration from Muslim-majority countries, and subsequent doubling down on that position by the White House.
Musk held fast even following Uber CEO Travis Kalanick’s departure from Trump’s economic advisory council, when Kalanick left following the issuance of the immigration order. Musk noted then that he believed “engaging on critical issues [would] on balance serve the greater good” as his reasoning for sticking with the council at the time.
Update —  The departures continue. Disney CEO Bob Iger is resigning from the president’s council as well, calling it a “matter of principle”:


As a matter of principle, I've resigned from the President's Council over the  #ParisAgreement withdrawal.

92,Marijuana media giant High Times sells majority stake for ~$42 million,https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/01/high-times-acquired/,2017/06/01,"
High Times, the most prestigious brand in pot, has been valued at $70 million in a deal that sees it selling a 60% majority stake for roughly $42 million to investment firm Oreva Capital. Originally a marijuana enthusiasts magazine founded in 1974, High Times has blossomed into a set up web properties and the Cannabis Cup marijuana contest event series.
With wide scale marijuana legalization looming, Oreva tells me it saw High Times as ill-equipped to roll up the massive opportunities for expansion. “I wouldn’t say the current company was sleeping at the wheel, but they haven’t optimized” says Oreva Capital founder Adam Levin. The media and event business will now be known as the High Times Holding Company (HTHC) — a crafty play on the psychoactive compound in marijuana known as THC.

While upstart marijuana media and ecommerce companies like WeedMaps and Leafly are earning up to $60 per user per year, Levin says High Times earns just $0.17 per visitor. Levin sees ways to close the gap by bringing some basic best practices to a company that had only had two previous owners, both affiliated with the founder Tom Forcade’s family.
Yet as the longest-running and most recognizable brand in pot, rivaled only perhaps by Snoop Dogg himself, High Times online sees a flood of 20 million unique visitors per month beyond its 236,000 print subscribers. “There wasn’t a Pepsi to its Coke” Levin laughs.”
The best chance for High Times to fire up some more revenue could be expanding the Cannabis Cup to more states as legalization rolls across the US. Designed as a trade expo for local pot dispensaries and quality contest for growers, there are already 58 Cannabis Cup events each year which account for 75% of High Times’ revenue between ticket sales and sponsorships. TechCrunch itself has seen how parleying a media business into a contest and expo event series like Disrupt can be incredibly lucrative.

New management will be baked in beside the whole existing High Team staff, including a new head of entertainment and VP of biz dev. TechCrunch has obtained a memo sent by Levin to the High Times team, embedded below.
With marijuana going mainstream, we’re amidst “the green rush”. This proliferation of pot companies, from delivery services to consumer brands to point-of-sale business software, are seeking to capitalize on end of a prohibition era. And when new smokers come looking for which dispensary to buy from or weed tourism trips to take, a trusted media property like High Times could grow its role of defining what’s dank.

93,Your windows become powerful with SolarGaps,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/31/solargaps-power-blinds/,2017/05/31,"
If you’re about to replace your roof, Tesla has you covered, but roofs have a long life span, and besides, not all of us have the luxury/misery of having a roof to replace in the first place. Most of us have walls with glass in them, however, and that’s the window of opportunity SolarGaps is reaching for, with a Kickstarter campaign for its solar panel window blinds.
At first glimpse, this sounds like a brilliant idea. Per square footage, we probably have more window glass than roof space in the world; why not leverage it? The slick Kickstarter campaign shows the company’s vision, which is undoubtedly ambitious. SolarGaps integrates with a smartphone app, Google Home, Amazon Echo and the Nest Thermostat. It can either feed electricity back into the grid or into a battery system like the Tesla Powerwall. On top of all that, the campaign claims the product can be custom-made for the same cost as (non-solar) motorized blinds.
In theory, the product is sound: On a south-facing wall, the most direct sunlight you can expect (averaged through the year) is about 10 hours per day. For a 10-square-foot panel (which the company quotes at $385), the company indicates around 1.5Kwh per day on average, or 500 kWh per year. At current prices, that’s power generation of around $88 per year, assuming it’s sunny every day. At a cost of $385, it means it’ll take about 4-6 years to earn the SolarGaps back, assuming all the estimates are correct, and you live in a place that has perfect sunshine year around.
Right off the bat, I spot a couple of challenges. Ask a 5-year-old to point at a window and they’ll point sideways. Ask them where the sun is, and they’ll point straight above. Which means that the sides of walls are already at a disadvantage to roof-mounted panels. Of course, the panels do live on slats, so it’s possible to point the panels toward the sun, but still.
The SolarGaps team sent me a small, approximately 3.2-foot panel to try out. The build quality looks solid, and when you think of it as a set of blinds to keep the sun out, it works great. However, when trying to measure the company’s stated performance, I fell short; the panel wasn’t delivering even close to what I ought to be measuring. It doesn’t help that the panel I was sent had a 220V to 110V converter, and that the DC-DC converter box I was supplied for testing is a lot less efficient than what the company is planning to ship. I questioned the wisdom of sending a review sample to a journalist with so many bottlenecks that it’s hard to evaluate whether or not it’s working properly, and received a photo of the company’s testing setup in response.
SolarGaps’ testing rig in Redwood City, California
You’ll probably have spotted that the panel is balanced at a wall at an angle, outside. Which is cool for prototyping, of course, but also highlights the challenge mentioned above: Walls and windows tend to be vertical, without the luxury of angling the panel.
“To get best results your SolarGaps should be facing the sun and not under any shade, and you should rotate blinds using our application to get the best results,” says SolarGaps’ CEO Yevgen Erik. On the other hand, he also points out that “SolarGaps provides active window shading. This will help reduce energy wasted on AC by up to 40% and your payback period may just be 3 years or less depending on how frequently you are using AC. We can reduce this and try to help solve climate change.”
SolarGaps also suggests that they’ve been able to improve the efficiency of its product by 20 percent with software updates. They suggest further optimizations will be possible.
The company is recommending that you mount the panels on the outside of your windows, rather than on the inside. Of course, that brings its own challenges, as installation, wind-proofing and cable installation is likely to get more complicated on the outside of a building, compared to on the inside.
Ultimately, I think that SolarGaps is a good solution for areas that suffer from brutal heat, high air-conditioning bills and consistent sunshine. Wearing my business hat, though — on the company’s behalf, I worry about how small that makes its potential target market. Having said that, with 14 days to go, 231 people believe in the product to the tune of about $60,000, comfortably beating SolarGaps’ $50,000 goal on Kickstarter, so perhaps they’re seeing an opportunity that’s missed on me.

94,Tesla Model 3 said to do 0-60 mph in 5.6 seconds,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/25/tesla-model-3-said-to-do-0-60-mph-in-5-6-seconds/,2017/05/25,"
The Tesla Model 3 is so close you could taste it (probably tastes like car) but we don’t yet know final specs on the vehicle. A new retail comparison chart surfaced at the Tesla Model 3 Owners Club forum (via InsideEVs) that offers some insight into what we can expect for specs, though it seems primarily designed to remind prospective buyers how great the Model S is by comparison.
In the diagram, we see that the Model 3 has a 0-60 mph acceleration time of 5.6 seconds, which is more than double the Model S best time of 2.3 seconds (which is achieved with the P100D variant operating in Ludicrous Mode). That’s in keeping with Tesla’s announced specs of “under 6 seconds” for the base model, which was made public in April, 2016.
The rest of the info from the chart was previously known, including a “215+” mile range from a single charge, and delivery time extending out beyond the one year mark, as well as pay-per-use charging at Tesla’s high-speed Supercharger stations. The trunk space detail also shows the value gap between the two cars – the smaller Model 3 has less than half the interior storage volume across both its trunk and its ‘frunk’ (front trunk).
While a 5.6 second 0-60 time isn’t going to break any records, it does put the Model 3 in comfortable company with the Audi A3 and near the BMW 330i, and it’ll definitely feel like a fast car, especially for sedan owners coming to electric from the first time from fuel injection vehicles.

95,"New Smart Fortwo EV: fewer dollars, more miles",https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/24/new-smart-fortwo-ev-fewer-dollars-more-miles/,2017/05/24,"
Mercedes-Benz announced the price of its new electric 2017 Smart Fortwo: $23,800 for the hard-top coupe and $28,000 for the cabrio with a sliding canvas roof. The new coupe’s price is $1,200 less than the outgoing model, but the cabrio’s price is exactly the same.
Besides the price, there are some practical improvements for the new Fortwo EV. There are a few more batteries on board — 96 lithium-ion cells versus the old 93 — though the battery capacity stays the same at 17.6 kWh. The on-board charger is more powerful, so the charging time drops in half, to three hours or less. The range gets a little bump from 68 miles to 70-80 miles, enough for daily urban commutes.
The 2017 Smart Fortwo EV will be available in the United States this summer, but these tiny two-seaters have had a tough time finding a niche in America, the land of SUVs and wide roads. Parent company Daimler decided to discontinue sales of gasoline-powered Smart cars in the States this year to focus on the EVs. It also decided to stop using Smart cars in its Car2Go point-to-point car-sharing service, with Mercedes-Benz cars replacing fleets in the U.S. beginning in 2017.
Smart doesn’t intend to compete with SUVs and pickup trucks, so who is the competition? The Tesla Model 3, the forthcoming small (but not micro) car, will have a 215-mile range for $35,000. The Chevy Bolt starts at $37,500 and has a range of more than 200 miles. The Volkswagen e-Golf gets 83 miles per charge, which is similar to the Fortwo’s range, but it starts at about $29,000 before tax incentives are applied. The new Hyundai Ioniq has more miles per charge, at 124, but its price starts at $29,500.
So for shorter-range emissions-free commuting and errand-running, the Smart Fortwo is an inexpensive option. But for carrying more than two people — or if you have a near-crippling case of range anxiety — you’ll need to pay more for one of the other EVs.

96,SolarCity founder Lyndon Rive is leaving Tesla in June,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/16/solarcity-founder-lyndon-rive-is-leaving-tesla-in-june/,2017/05/16,"
Lyndon Rive, the CEO and co-founder of SolarCity prior to its acquisition by Tesla, will leave the automaker/energy company in June. Rive announced his departure on Monday in an interview with Reuters, saying he’s departing in order to spend more time with family and to spin up a new company sometime next year.
Since the two companies combined, Rive has been working as the head of sales and services for Tesla’s energy division, which includes SolarCity’s rooftop panels and Tesla’s Powerwall batteries, along with both companies’ commercial operations. Rive is Musk’s cousin, and co-founded SolarCity in 2006 with his brother Peter. Peter will remain at Tesla, with a role focused specifically on Tesla’s new solar roofing product, which opened for orders last week.
Rive told Reuters that he’s more interested in “starting and running companies,” but it’s also true that Tesla has changed its strategy regarding installations on homes, which definitely impacts Rive’s original vision of providing a means to get to low-cost, widespread distribution of aftermarket installations for everyday people.
A Tesla spokesperson provided the following statement from the company regarding Rive’s departure:
Lyndon Rive co-founded SolarCity eleven years ago, and built it into the number one solar provider in the nation. Thanks in large part to the foundation Lyndon helped create, Tesla has now built the world’s first integrated sustainable energy company, from generation to storage to transportation. Because of his leadership and dedication to our mission, Lyndon has helped position Tesla for an amazing future. We know he’s an entrepreneur at heart, and we wish him the very best on his next venture.

97,CityConnect shows you how climate change will impact your own home,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/14/cityconnect-shows-you-how-climate-change-will-impact-your-own-home/,2017/05/14,"
We’ve all seen the maps that show Florida being consumed by rising sea levels. But many of us still underestimate the impact of climate change because we can’t actually visualize its effects on the places we care about. In just a few hours at the TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2017 Hackathon, James Butler, Caitlin Squyres and Florian Carls put together CityConnect, a tool that lets people see flood levels for the City of Cambridge using Google’s Street View.
Butler, a startup founder with a passion for city planning, came up with the idea after watching his city struggle to explain how future flooding would impact residents. CityConnect aggregates data to build a 3D model of flooding at the street level. The team built two models, one to show the depth of water during a 100-year flood in the year 2035 and another to show depth during a 100-year flood in the year 2070.

Residents can actually see flood levels lined up next to their homes so they can determine what parts of their property might end up underwater when disaster occurs. This allows people to take pragmatic steps like repositioning electric meters or reinforcing seals on windows. Visualizing the impact of climate change on your own home makes the changes personal.
“If you hand someone Google Earth, the first thing they do is go to their address,” noted Squyres in an interview after her demo.
CityConnect modeled Cambridge for their project but the same process could be repeated for any other city. Unfortunately the project isn’t online yet, but the team plans to work on this and a VR implementation in the future that would make it possible to walk down a flooded street.
Beyond VR, IBM Watson could also be used to set up a multi-language warning system if CityConnect added in stream gauge data. Butler told me that he plans to present the team’s work at an Alewife zoning board meeting next week to put the hack to real use.

98,Val.ai lets self-driving cars bid for parking spots,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/14/self-parking-vehicle/,2017/05/14,"
Where will self-driving cars go once they drop you off? In big cities, parking can be expensive and take forever to find. But TechCrunch Disrupt NY hackathon team Val.ai built a way for autonomous vehicles to participate in auctions for nearby parking spaces.
When a self-driving car needs to park itself, it can submit real-time bids for local spots occupied by others. If a currently parked car knows it needs to pick someone up soon, and it will earn more from selling the parking spot now than the gas it might burn driving around until its pick-up time, it can accept a bid. The winning bidder vehicle gets directions to the spot, and the one parked there vacates when it arrives.



While there aren’t so many self-driving cars on the road that we need this just yet, technology like Val.ai could eventually reduce congestion and pollution by more efficiently routing cars to spaces. The project was built using Clarifai, ThingSpace and MapQuest.
But there’s one big problem with Val.ai. The pitch made it sound like the cars would be auctioning off public parking spots. Squatting in these spots until another car pays enough could be seen as abusing public resources for private gain. When a few startups tried to do this a few years ago for human-driven cars, we labeled these resource-abusing startups as “#JerkTech.”

The real opportunity here for a business that doesn’t unfairly profit off the commons is to set up commercial parking lots that use this real-time bidding system.

99,"Tesla opens up Solar Roof pre-orders, answers the most important question: how much will it cost you?",https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/10/tesla-opens-up-solar-roof-pre-orders-answers-the-most-important-question-how-much-will-it-cost-you/,2017/05/10,"
Back in October of last year, Tesla unveiled a new project it had been secretly cracking away at behind the scenes: solar roof tiles. Unlike traditional solar panels that sit on top of the roof, these solar tiles would replace your roof outright — and, if all went to plan, they’d look as good as any other roof. Just… maybe a little shinier.
The first question that popped up on everyone’s mind seemed to be the same: “Cool! How much will it cost?”
Alas, that question has proven challenging to answer. Tesla has given ballpark estimates and comparison numbers, but there’s no one concrete answer that fits all homes. Different homes have different energy needs; different structures have different roofs and different challenges (chimneys, trees, etc); different states have different tax breaks.
This afternoon, pre-orders are going live ($1,000 deposit, refundable if you change your mind before signing the final contract). They can’t really expect people to pre-order without some idea of what they’ll pay in the end, so they’ve built a cost calculator that tries to crunch the numbers for your specific house.
Punch in your address and it’ll spit out a custom estimate.
Here’s what one looks like:

Tesla is tapping Google’s Project Sunroof here, which uses some 3D mapping trickery to give them a rough idea of how much roof area (square footage) you’ve got, and how much of it is actually good for solar use. That gives them a ballpark estimate for the roof cost (including materials, installation and the cost of removing your old roof), at which point they factor in the cost of a Powerwall battery. Then they wrap in offsets like local tax credits and the money saved on your electric bill to give you a final cost after 30 years.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk also shed a bit of light on how the ordering process works: Once you’ve placed your order and made your way up the waiting list, they send out an engineer who works out exactly what your roof needs. How much square footage of tile? How much of it should be solar versus non-solar?
That last bit is an interesting note: not all tiles they install will actually be solar tiles. Spots on your roof that don’t get much sun, for example, will get non-solar tiles — but they’ll look exactly the same from the street, says Elon.
The company also tightened up the timing window of various panel styles a bit: installations of the the smooth/textured glass solar panels will start this year, while the wavier Tuscan and Slate panels won’t start hitting houses until 2018 (Elon tweeted that it’d be in “about 6 months,” so it sounds like he’s aiming for sooner than later.)

100,Ceres Imaging raises $5 million to pinpoint crop stress for farmers,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/10/ceres-imaging-raises-5-million-to-pinpoint-crop-stress-for-farmers/,2017/05/10,"
Oakland, Calif.-based Ceres Imaging has raised $5 million in a Series A investment led by Romulus Capital. The startup uses cameras, sensors and software to pinpoint crop stress in the field for farmers, so that they can apply herbicides, pesticides and irrigation just where it’s needed.
Ceres, like several other startups, started out with the notion to build a drone just for agricultural use. However, according to CEO and founder Founder Ashwin Madgavkar, the company quickly realized commercial farmers needed to cover thousands of acres, proving too big a job for most drones.
Instead, Madgavkar said, the company has developed a proprietary sensor and camera which pilots in traditional aircraft, like Cessnas, can fly over vast swathes of farmland every day.
Besides its sensors, the company has created image analyzing software that can zero in on just the vegetation, leaving out soil and shadows in post-processing analysis. “We translate spectral signatures into what’s happening on the ground,” the CEO said. The company has worked closely with researchers and data from UC Davis to perfect its analytics.
Romulus Capital founder Krishna K. Gupta said Ceres stood out from other agtech players because it is using hyper spectral imaging to provide “ground-level insights” to farmers. Many other companies rely on the “NDVI,” the normalized difference vegetation index for crop analysis. This provides a measure of leaves per unit area. “Ceres can get a finer grain detail on what a farmer’s crops, irrigation and nutrient profile looks like,” Krishna said.
Ceres is already working with six out of ten of the world’s largest tree nut and vine growers with most of its work in California and Australia today, Madgavkar said. It provides imaging for at least 10% of the global almond industry now.
The company plans to use its Series A funding for hiring, expanding its sales and marketing efforts, and to adapt its analytics to help growers of corn, soy and other commodity crops in the Midwest, the CEO said.
Competitors include TerrAvion, Intelinair, and drone-based solutions like PrecisionHawk to name a few.
Prior to raising its Series A round, Ceres attained $1 million in non-dilutive grant funding from the likes of water tech accelerator ImagineH2O, and the Elemental Excelerator, a non-profit backed by Laurene Powell Jobs’ Emerson Collective.
While regulation can hamper some startups, Madgavkar said it’s actually aiding demand for Ceres’ technology. “Farmers are dealing with increased regulation which prevents them from just applying a lot of chemicals and fertilizers like they used to,” he said. Being able to look on a map, and quickly see where a crop is experiencing stress, or where the soil may be lacking nitrogen or potassium, helps them work within the new rules.

101,Tesla’s solar roof tiles go up for pre-order today,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/10/teslas-solar-roof-tiles-go-up-for-pre-order-today/,2017/05/10,"
Tesla is opening up pre-orders for its solar roof tiles today — a little later than previously slated.
CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the company will be accepting orders for the tiles from later this afternoon. Although only two of the four possible tile styles are being made available at this point.
Responding to a question via Twitter Musk said the first version of the tiles that can be pre-ordered are the black glass smooth and textured versions.
Tuscan and French slate versions will be available to order “in about six months”, he added.
Musk said the tiles can be ordered “for almost any country”, including specific confirms for Australia and the UK.
He also confirmed that deployment — i.e. delivery and installation — will be this year in the US, and in 2018 for overseas orders.
There’s no official confirm on price yet which really is the key detail here. Because, while traditional solar panels may look unsightly, the historical cost of the renewable technology has undoubtedly been the biggest barrier to wider uptake — though the price of solar has also been falling significantly in recent years.
Previous hints from Tesla on the cost of its solar tiles have suggested the price of the system will amount to the price of an ordinary roof plus the cost of electricity.
Which implies solar tiles will require an initial outlay that’s more than the upfront cost of a traditional slate roof. But we should know more in a few hours…


Tesla solar glass roof orders open this afternoon. I think it will be great. More in about 10 hours …
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 10, 2017



Tesla announced the quartz glass solar roof tiles last fall, showing off four aesthetic looks that resembled fairly closely a current roofing material style.
The tiles are transparent to allow sunlight to penetrate the cells from above but appear opaque when viewed from an angle. And they have roughly equivalent efficiency of traditional solar power gathering cells, while aiming to blend in rather better with traditional roofing aesthetic.
The product is being billed as being able to generate enough energy to fully power a household. While any excess power generated could be stored in Tesla’s Powerwall 2.0 battery units, giving the homeowner a backup energy source to cover demand spikes.

102,Cover raises $1.6 million to make in-law units easy to add to any backyard,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/09/cover-raises-1-6-million-to-make-in-law-units-easy-to-add-to-any-back-yard/,2017/05/09,"
Whether you call them granny units, in-laws or backyard studios, accessory dwelling units are rising in popularity in the U.S., in part due to new regulations that make it easier to obtain permits to build them in California.
Now, a startup called Cover Technologies Inc. has raised $1.6 million in seed funding to give accessory dwelling units a high-tech makeover. General Catalyst and Khosla Ventures led the round.
According to Cover co-founder and CEO Alexis Rivas, the Gardena, Calif. startup is on a mission to make well-designed and energy-efficient housing affordable and accessible. “We’re the first to use software to make custom-designed housing possible, and scalable as a business,” Rivas said.
Cover’s software helps people determine what kind of livable shed they’re permitted to build on their properties, according to local regulations. It jogs them through a survey of 50 to 100 questions about the land they’re building on, and how they plan to use the new living space, then churns out design options.

Other companies that offer “prefab” housing, for example Blu Homes, present users with a list of already designed layouts and let them figure out the rest. Most people still rely on contractors and architects for custom work to design and install an in-law or shed where they live.
General Catalyst Managing Director Niko Bonatsos said he expects Cover to use its funding for hiring, and to produce demo units and prefabricated backyard studios that are already spoken for by early customers.
Bonatsos said, “Most buildings on the planet have been custom designed and custom built. That’s a good idea if you are talking about building the Parthenon or Golden Gate Bridge. But everything else, from what we drink to our furniture, is now made in a factory. The prices come down and quality goes up with manufacturing. This space, housing, really requires this kind of innovation.”
General Catalyst, which is an investor in Airbnb, also sees the potential for Cover to help expand the supply of non-hotel lodgings in the highest-demand markets in the U.S., Bonatsos said.
Cover’s prefab homes and plans are only available for Los Angeles residents at this point. The company charges users $250 to generate designs and has not yet established pricing to make and install the completed “backyard studios.” The units are made from steel, bamboo and other ecologically sourced materials, Rivas said.

103,Abundant Robotics rakes in $10 million for apple harvesting robots,https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/03/abundant-robotics-rakes-in-10-million-for-apple-harvesting-robots/,2017/05/03,"
GV (formerly Google Ventures) is leading a $10 million investment in Abundant Robotics, a company building apple-picking robots that could eventually be adapted to harvest other fruits. Joining GV in the round were BayWa AG and Tellus Partners, along with the company’s earlier backers Yamaha Motor Company, KPCB Edge and Comet Labs.
Abundant Robotics chief executive and co-founder Dan Steere said his company began working with the apple industry four years ago to figure out how to automate the cumbersome task of picking apples. “It’s very difficult to locate fruit that’s ready to be picked within a canopy and then retrieve it without turning it into apple sauce,” he said.
Every fall in the U.S. and in Australia, the company’s engineers can be found in different orchards testing their technologies and working alongside farmers to understand what’s still needed. The company’s robots are designed to work around-the-clock, identifying and picking apples even in the dark of night.
On the hardware side, as TechCrunch previously reported, Abundant Robotics’ machines have tackled some of the challenges around “manipulation,” or handling of fragile fruits, by using a vacuum instead of any claw or hand-like graspers to pull apples from the branch.
GV General Partner Andy Wheeler said, “In essence, they’ve made self-driving cars, with a diesel engine and power train, that have to pick apples as they go along. Theirs is a complex product to solve a complex problem.” Given the Series A round of funding, Wheeler said, Abundant Robotics should be able to get commercial units picking in the field.
Abundant Robotics is part of a new generation of hardware companies developing autonomous equipment for use on farms, both on the ground and in the sky. Its peers include companies like Harvest Automation, Deepfield Robotics, Kespry, Lely and the Autonomous Tractor company.
Prior to its Series A, Abundant Robotics had raised $2 million in seed funding and spun out of SRI International via its SRI Ventures arm.
Agriculture in the U.S. and much of the world is facing a tremendous labor shortage today. Meanwhile, the World Bank estimates we’ll need to make 50 percent more food by 2050 to sustain the growing, global population, with climate change decreasing crop yields by 25 percent outdoors.
While pessimists see robots as “bad for jobs” in agriculture, robots could be a critical means of increasing food production while keeping costs, and the environmental impacts of farming, as low as possible.

Elon Musk was on stage at the 2017 TED Conference in Vancouver on Friday, and he revealed some of his tunnel work and aspirations, but he also talked about a few ongoing Tesla projects he’s referenced before. The multi-CEO showed a shadowy image that gives us our first look at what his forthcoming electric Semi Truck will look like, and also let drop the suggestion that Tesla will likely announce four new global Gigafactory locations sometime this year.

The truck looks exactly like you’d expect a transport truck to look, roughly, but with a smooth continuous design between the windshield and the upper facade. There’s also headlights that resemble the ones used on existing Tesla cars, including the Model X and Model S, so it’s reasonable to expect some design continuity between Tesla’s consumer and commercial vehicles.
The truck gets more from Tesla’s existing lineup than just its looks – the CEO said on stage that it’ll be a “spry” vehicle, which can be driven like a sports car. Musk said he himself has already taken the prototype for a ride.
We’ll still have to wait until September to see the truck in its full glory, but Musk said it should be able to not only hold its own with, but also outperform current diesel-powered big rigs.
Meanwhile, Musk also said that there will be likely four new Gigafactory sites announced this year. This is also something Tesla has touched on before; the company said in its most recent earnings report that it plans to finalize locations for up to three new Gigafactory sites this year, in addition to the existing Nevada location, and the New York plant for solar technology it’s operating in partnership with Panasonic.
Electrek recently reported that Musk’s meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang could’ve included discussions around a possible Gigafactory site, which follows a recent significant investment by giant Chinese Internet firm Tencent.

105,BMW’s plug-in hybrid 530e iPerformance will get wireless charging,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/28/bmws-plug-in-hybrid-530e-iperformance-will-get-wireless-charging/,2017/04/28,"
BMW revealed its newest electric vehicle, a plug-in hybrid called the 530e iPerformance. The variant’s options include a forthcoming wireless charging pad, targeting a 2018 release window, which will include a charging pad drivers can install in their garage and drive over to provide a power supply with rates up to 3.2 kW, with a total charging time for refilling the vehicle’s onboard battery of about three and a half hours.
BMW is already showing the wireless pad and its charging capabilities in prototype form, and the system includes visual feedback and instructions for the driver via the in-car infotainment dash display, so that they know when they’ve pulled in for an optimal charging connection. Wireless charging is a big carrot for EVs and hybrids, since it takes away the added mental component involved in remembering to plug your car in once you’re done driving. It seems like a small thing, but it goes against many decades of learned behavior for most drivers.

The other interesting component here is that BMW is offering its Digital Charging Service for the 530e iPerformance, which intelligently manages charging when plugged in so that the car remains topped off for when it needs to drive. The service also adjusts the planned charging to draw power mostly during off-peak hours, and to prefer power supplied by the customer’s own solar power generation capacity, if they have both that and BMW’s Wallbox Connect dedicated vehicle charging solution.
Getting customers excited about electric vehicles is in part about making sure they see that it’s also not going to change their lives dramatically in terms of their daily routine and how they use their cars. These charging technologies help with that, and wireless charging in particular should be a hit if BMW can deliver it as promised.

106,ChargePoint is ready for flying EVs,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/26/chargepoint-is-ready-for-flying-evs/,2017/04/26,"
Yesterday I wrote about a poll conducted by researchers at the University of Michigan that found people were interested in flying cars if they were autonomous, shared and electric. As soon as I posted that, I found an email in my inbox saying that ChargePoint and Uber Elevate, among others at the recent conference on flying vehicles, had partnered to prepare for just that exact scenario.
ChargePoint announced the Express Plus charging platform at CES 2017, which allows for faster, more powerful charging and modularity. That means that owners of the stations can expand their charging options as they need to — which includes charging electric flying cars. The latest estimates say that it will take a minimum of 300 kW to charge a flying car 25 percent in 5 minutes, or 25-90 percent in 15 minutes. ChargePoint’s Express Plus stations can deliver up to 400 kW per port right now, so operators could add a station for flying vehicles in the future without ripping out infrastructure that’s already in place.
ChargePoint already knows that charging quickly generates a lot of heat, which is why it developed liquid-cooled hoses for its Express Plus stations. But charging a flying vehicle would likely require extended cooling, even around the battery pack itself during fast charging. The vehicle needs to be able to ascend to altitude within about 90 seconds, and the batteries need to be cool enough to take that strain.
ChargePoint’s stations will be able to support vertical takeoff and landing, aka VTOL, which is again exactly what people said they preferred in the University of Michigan poll. The fundamental elements are already in place for charging VTOL vehicles, but the Express Plus stations themselves will need to be redesigned to accommodate them, and the plug and hose will likely need to be redesigned to fit the particulars of the vehicles, whatever that may be.
Why would ChargePoint bother to jump onto a technology bandwagon that seems kind of out there? The answer is that ChargePoint is already developing charging solutions for electric cars, buses and trucks. The company seems to be up for charging anything that needs electricity to move now and in the future — even flying cars.

107,Taylor Farms wants to make food without fossil fuels,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/26/taylor-farms-wants-to-make-food-without-fossil-fuels/,2017/04/26,"
As industries go, agriculture represents one of the worst environmental offenders, according to research by the United Nations Environment Programme. Farms need tending around the clock. So besides all the fertilizers, pesticides and water they use, farms also burn a lot of fossil fuels and money to keep the lights on, tractors rolling and refrigerators humming.
Now one major agricultural player in the U.S., Taylor Farms, is making an effort to make food without fossil fuels, and shrink its environmental footprint. The company recently completed a makeover of the systems used to power its Gonzales, Calif. facilities, where it makes fresh-cut salads and other vegetables.
Taylor Farms produce is sold at major groceries like Target, Walmart, Publix, Sam’s Club and Stop & Shop. Its competitors include the likes of Dole Fresh Vegetables, Chiquita-owned Fresh Express, Ready Pac Produce and Earthbound Farms.
Nicole Flewell, director of sustainability at Taylor Farms, told TechCrunch, “We have three different technologies at this one site. So it’s a unique ecosystem of energy production.” Previously, the company had tried solar, wind and fuel cells but never used more than one renewable energy source at a time on any of its farms.
“We are a 24-hour, 365-day business, so to tie these elements together, we had to shut down for 6 to 8 hours, and that was a substantial challenge. You can’t kill power for a substantial time where you have a refrigeration facility,” Flewell explained.
The company had to batten down the hatches around its chilled rooms, ship out as much product as it could at once, and push their food production schedule ahead to prepare shipments for buyers early, for days ahead of the switch.
The Gonzales facility now employs: solar, wind and co-generation systems from REC Solar, Foundation Wind Power and Concentric Power. While solar and wind power are already familiar technologies to most, co-generation may not be.
The Concentric Power system installed at Taylor is a “cogen plant,” that’s about 40 x 60 feet. It uses natural gas and waste heat to provide low-temperature refrigeration for Taylor’s vegetables. Installing such a system requires tie-ins to a facility’s pipes and electrical systems. It’s not quite like plugging in a new refrigerator at home.
Taylor Farms’ co-generation plant
Why pack three different types of cleantech into one farm? Wasn’t solar enough in the sunny Salinas Valley? Flewell explained, “We are located in a wind channel off the Monterey Bay. We wanted to take advantage of that. And we could easily install 1MW of rooftop solar. But those are intermittent energy sources… We worried if we’d have enough power every night and every season. Cogen let us meet that baseline capacity.”
According to Taylor Farms CEO and founder Bruce Taylor, the company started testing renewable energy technologies five or six years ago, purchasing the first version of the Bloom Energy cell, and installing solar arrays at its Salinas retail plant.
Some things didn’t go according to plan, he reflected: “We learned a lot of things like you may have to clean your solar panels more frequently than you expected if a construction site next door starts blowing a lot of dust.” Other things were a happy surprise, he said. Taylor Farms has been able to generate far more power from solar than it thought it might, and now has more surplus to sell back to the grid.
“It does feel like we are moving quickly relative to other food producers,” he said. “Our goal is for energy independence. We are working to get ourselves off the grid.”

Uber’s Elevate summit, which brings together experts in the vertical take-off and landing industry, is happening in Dallas, Texas starting today and continuing through tomorrow. The conference includes a number of sessions, with participation from experts from some of the largest aeronautics companies in the world, as well as regulators and leading academics.
Basically, if you’re looking for a ‘state of the VTOL’ summary snapshot for 2017, this will be your best possible chance to get it all in one place. The opportunities for electric VTOL craft include building on-demand, fast, efficient transit networks of essentially flying cars for use in dense, urban environments, and Uber wants to encourage everyone to focus on making it a reality from a hardware and vehicle standpoint, so that Uber can provide the ride hailing infrastructure and software to make it run.
The Summit begins with a keynote at 11 AM EST (10 AM CST or 8 AM PST), though they appear to be running a bit behind schedule, so you can tune in now.

109,"Tesla to double its Supercharger network in 2017, topping 10K chargers globally",https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/24/tesla-to-double-its-supercharger-network-in-2017-topping-10k-chargers-globally/,2017/04/24,"
Tesla is getting ready to produce the Model 3 at volumes unprecedented for the company, but it hasn’t forgotten about that other key ingredient in the electric vehicle mix – charging infrastructure. The automaker announced today that while it began 2017 with over 5,000 Superchargers installed globally, it will end the year with double that, offering 10,000 Supercharger connections worldwide.
The Destination charging connectors, which are commercial equivalents of the high-capacity home chargers EV owners install in their garage, will also get a boost, from over 9,000 installations today, to over 15,000 by end of year. In total in North America, the number of Superchargers will increase 150 percent, and EV-loving California will get over 1,000 new Superchargers during 2017 within the state alone.
Tesla’s global doubling of the Supercharger network in 2017 represents an exponential acceleration of its expansion; the Supercharger program launched in 2012, meaning it’s taken five full years to get to the 5,000 charger milestone. The expansion also includes increasing capacity at existing sites, adding more in dense areas like urban centers, and generally trying to eliminate and alleviate existing and expected wait times for drivers.
In the end the Tesla infrastructure push will be much-needed, since the additional demand brought about by a Model 3 vehicle population that could swell by as many as 500,000 units per year (if Tesla meets its ambitious production goals) will come with an equivalent spike in charging location demand. And since most Model 3s will likely have lower top range capacity when compared to Model S and X vehicles, demand could spike further still.

110,Planet enlists machine learning experts to parse a treasure trove of Amazon basin data,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/20/planet-enlists-machine-learning-experts-to-parse-a-treasure-trove-of-amazon-basin-data/,2017/04/20,"
Planet, the satellite imaging company that operate the largest commercial Earth imaging constellation in existence, is hosting a new data science competition on the Kaggle platform, with the specific aim of developing machine learning techniques around forestry research. Planet will open up access to thousands of image ‘chips,’ or blocks covering around 1 sauce kilometre, and will give away a total of $60,000 to participants who place in the top three when coming up with new methods for analyzing the data available in these images.
Planet notes that each minute, we lose a portion of forest the size of approximately 48 football fields, which is a heck of a lot of forest. The hope is that by releasing this data and hosting this competition, Planet can encourage academics and researchers worldwide to apply advances in machine learning that have been put to great use in efforts like facial recognition and detect, to this pressing ecological problem.
“We’re putting together this competition as a way to get people excited about the kinds of data that Planet provides,” explained Planet machine learning engineer Kat Scott in an interview. “Particularly when you’re analyzing imaging and that sort of thing, everyone works off the same sort of jpgs, but our satellites have these sort of superpowers. We get multiple bands at very high resolution, and deep bit depth, so we put together this interesting data set of all the interesting things that are gong on right now that we’d like to monitor. So things like deforestation, new agriculture, what we call artisanal mining which is basically illegal mining, and all these other effects.”
The goal is to see if competitors can come up with new ways to monitor these situations with machine learning tools created to make sense of the data. It’s a bit like finding a needle in a haystack, according to Scott, which is why the need exists for this machine learning-driven approach, taken on from multiple teams tackling the data from multiple angles.
“These mining areas might only be a couple of kilometers across, but we’re providing you with 37 million acres of imagery, so how do you sort that really quickly, and find those changes that occur over time,” Scott explained.
Competitors will submit their results using Kaggle, and Planet retains ownership rights to the IP, but the plan is to release all resulting data under a Creative Commons share-alike license to help continue to drive large improvements in machine learning in this area over time.
The first-place winner will receive $30,000 for their efforts, and the second and third-place teams will get $20,000 and $10,000 respectively. More information regarding the competition can be found at the Kaggle website.

Electric production vehicles may be relatively rare, but electric concepts abound, and most of them are targeting 2020 for a rough production date, as is the Volkswagen I.D. CROZZ, an all-electric design whose name I hope dies in a horrible fire between now and whenever (if ever) it does end up hitting the street.
The name does do one thing adequately well — it conveys that this is a “crossover,” that adulated category of vehicle everyone everywhere is going gaga over lately. We once called these small SUVs or large hatchbacks, but we’ve all grown up since then. And as grown-ups, someone felt that when another person said CROZZ in a board room it was a good idea.
It was not; but the car bearing that name sounds perfectly okay — maybe even good. It’s got around 300 miles of electric range, and full all-wheel drive, along with boosted charging capabilities that let it recover 80 percent of its driving time in just 30 minutes of charging using 150kW DC chargers. The concept also has full self-driving capabilities, which are of course aspirational at this stage, but which a driver will be able to engage just by touching the VW badge in the center of the CROZZ’s steering wheel for three continuous seconds.

As with Volkswagen’s initial I.D. series concept vehicle, this electric car has digital “eyes” made up of LEDs on the outside that are meant to communicate with other drivers and pedestrians, and its inside also offers augmented reality displays to surround the driver with info overlaid right on the world around them.
Volkswagen goes so far as to call this concept a “smartphone on wheels” in a press release, which is about the most direct, unvarnished and accurate expression of the current strategy of most automakers I think I’ve ever heard. Truth in advertising.

113,Audi’s latest concept is a new all-electric Tesla Model X competitor,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/18/audis-latest-concept-is-a-new-all-electric-tesla-model-x-competitor/,2017/04/18,"
Audi’s newest electric vehicle is a crossover SUV with a 4.5-second 0-60mph time, and an impressive range of around 300 miles when its 95kWh battery is topped up. The Audi e-tron Sportback is set for production starting in 2019, and it’s part of Audi’s larger strategy to bring at least three fully electric cars to market by 2020, and to have a quarter of its overall lineup equipped with EV batteries by 2025.
The carmaker is pursuing electric options fairly aggressively, likely part of an overall shift dictated by its parent company Volkswagen, which has been more emphatic about its EV plans since its diesel emissions scandal. The e-tron Sportback definitely sounds like it could be a strong contender to help show that the electric strategy is full of potential for a range of buyers, and it would be nice to see a vehicle that can compete in many ways with Tesla’s gull-wing luxury electric SUV, the Model X.
Audi has already announced the all-electric e-tron quattro, which is set to begin being offered for sale in 2018, and by then, not to mention when the e-tron Sportback hits the market, there should be no shortage of options in the high-end electric SUV market, judging by the announced roadmaps of a number of carmakers.

Futuristic tech touches make the Audi a sight to behold, including Matrix LED, laser lighting and OLEDs designed to provide new levels of light-based communication with the outside world, as well as passengers within. Based on this and other concepts we’ve seen, if you’re not crazy about the idea of cars becoming “expressive” anthropomorphized futurist love bugs, the future isn’t for you.
The e-tron Sportback also all but does away with blind spots thanks to strategically positioned cameras that pipe real-time images to displays built into the interior of the car’s doors, giving you a view as to what’s going on all around.

114,Tesla will reveal the final production Model 3 in July,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/13/tesla-will-reveal-the-final-production-model-3-in-july/,2017/04/13,"
Tesla is going to show Tesla 3 buyers what their call will officially look like in July, Elon Musk revealed on Twitter on Thursday. The Model 3’s first unveiling took place in April of 2016, where it said cameras weren’t allowed (unless they were built into your phone). Because smartphones are as good as they are, we got a fairly decent look at what the Model 3 looked like at the time, but the car maker isn’t showing off what CEO Elon Musk terms ‘final’ hardware until July: A lot can change in over a year.
The Model 3 has been spotted since April, of course; Tesla has official press images, and had one sitting in a garage at its solar tile product unveiling late last year. The company has also shown off a short video of the “release candidate” version of the car accelerating quickly out of a parking lot, and the car looked relatively similar to what we saw at the unveiling.
More recently, spy shots have also been circulating, as those release candidate vehicles are going through the paces in real-world testing in and around Tesla HQ, where anyone with a camera can snap a spy shot. The images from this Autoblog gallery (more photos at the source) again don’t reveal much in the way of dramatic changes from what was on stage last April, but it does bear a more direct resemblance to the Model S than it did originally, which is likely a good thing given general reaction to the more expensive car’s design.

Surface resemblance aside, Musk and Tesla have taken steps lately to remind people that the Model 3 is not the top-end vehicle in Tesla’s lineup. The CEO said on Twitter in March that the Model 3 is clearly the lower-specced option, despite what some may think about it being some kind of “upgrade” in terms of tech because it follows the Model S chronologically.
In July we should also get clarity on the exact specifications and capabilities of the Mode 3. What we know so far is that it will have a minimum of 215 miles of range from its electric battery, and that it will cost $35,000 U.S. prior to incentives for the base model. Musk also teased a forthcoming “Performance model” in the works, but noted that this wouldn’t be available for sale for at least a year from now.

Tesla plans to show off an electric pickup truck sometime within the next two years, the company’s CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter today. The pickup was teased originally when Musk revealed the second part of his “master plan” for Tesla, which began with selling expensive vehicles like the Roadster and Model S, and eventually leads to producing a wide range of more affordable vehicles at scale.
The truck was previously described as a “new kind of pickup” by Musk, though he’s alluded to the concept even prior to that. Tesla’s desire to create a pickup makes sense given the success of the category in the company’s home country, and it’s likely planned alongside an upcoming lower cost compact SUV, sometimes referred to the Model Y.
Musk also teased a forthcoming semi truck announcement, set for September, and a convertible version of the Roadster coming in the next iteration of Tesla’s first vehicle, which is a high priced car targeted at luxury buyers.
There’s also good news for those customers still hoping to receive their Model 3 pre-orders relatively soon: The final reveal of the production version of the Model 3 is coming in July, Musk said, which would fit with reports of multiple prototypes on the streets around Tesla HQ, and its anticipated shipping timeline, which should see the first units go out to customers by the end of this year.
Musk has said that by offering the Model 3, along with the Model S and Model X premium vehicles, it should be able to offer a future compact SUV and a pickup to cover most of the available consumer market. For lower cost segments, he believes that group transportation options, including a forthcoming shuttle bus vehicle for multi-passenger transit, is the better way to go vs. lower coast consumer cars.

116,Tesla will reveal its electric semi truck in September,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/13/tesla-will-reveal-its-electric-semi-truck-in-september/,2017/04/13,"
Elon Musk just let us know when we’ll get a look at the electric semi truck that he’s teased in the past: The Tesla transport vehicle will be revealed in September, the CEO said on Twitter on Thursday, noting that the team has “done an amazing job” and that the vehicle is “seriously next level.”
Plans at Tesla for an electric semi truck have been in the works for a while now: The vehicle was first mentioned back in July of 2016, when Musk revealed part 2 of his fabled “master plan” for his electric vehicle company. The Tesla Semi, as Musk called it, is designed to help reduce the cost of cargo transportation, and improve safety for drivers, according to the CEO at the time.
Tesla’s not the only company targeting electric drivetrains for transport vehicles; Nikola revealed its One vehicle last year, too, though that’s a hybrid that also uses compressed natural gas in addition to its electric battery.
Tesla’s goal overall is to “expand to cover the major forms of terrestrial transport,” according to Musk’s “master plan,” and the transport truck is part of that goal. It addresses commercial goods transportation, which represents a significant portion of the commercial transport market; Musk has also teased that the company will eventually reveal a shuttle bus-type of vehicle that will address the other major aspect of that market.

Lucid is continuing down its path of shipping a Tesla competitor, and the Air just underwent another milestone: High-speed testing. A performance-targeted prototype version of its flagship Air car, the first it’s intending to bring to production, hit Ohio’s 7.5-mile TRC test track to check out how it holds up under high-speed use, including a (software limited) top speed of 217 mph.
The performance testing is designed to help the team identify where the car is performing as expected in conditions that, while not likely to be encountered often in daily use, will still prove part of the appeal of the vehicle to its first customers. The Lucid Air will cost $52,500, once federal tax credits are applied, so while it’s not at the lofty height of the Tesla Model S, it’s still very much a vehicle owners will expect to keep up with others in the premium category.
The high-speed capabilities of the car also aren’t at odds with Lucid’s core goal of creating a vehicle that’s extremely efficient; to the contrary, Lucid says that the same things that make it an excellent performance vehicle will help it maximize its energy consumption when driven more normally, too.

118,"In Portland, Uber launches initiative to add electric vehicles to its fleet",https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/12/uber-electric-vehicle-initiative-in-portland-oregon/,2017/04/12,"
With a new electric vehicle initiative, Uber is finally speaking Portland’s language. The company shares a rocky history with the famously green city, but that won’t stop Portland from becoming the first U.S. market where Uber will push a set benchmarks for electrifying its fleet.
For the Portland version of Uber Electric, a program that the company rolled out to London last year, the ride-hailing company will team up with Drive Oregon, a partially state-funded nonprofit that seeks to get more electric vehicles on the road. With a combination of incentives and educational initiatives, Uber aims to make 10 percent of its Oregon fleet electric by 2019, statewide. Right now, the company says that 100 of the 6,000 active Portland Uber drivers use electric vehicles, so it has considerable work to do (beyond all of that other work it has to do).
To reach its 10 percent goal, Uber is pursuing a range of local collaborations. The company will work with Portland’s Black Parent Initiative to expand electric vehicle access to underserved communities, Cynergy E-Bikes to connect UberEATS couriers with electric bikes and Arcimoto, an Oregon-based EV company. Uber is expected to use its auto-lease subsidiary Xchange Leasing to offer in-house deals to drivers wishing to get behind the wheel of an EV.
“The City of Portland has also adopted some of the nation’s most aggressive measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” Uber stated about its mission in the city. “Uber Electric will help Portland and the state of Oregon achieve these important clean energy goals.”
Uber isn’t the only alternative transportation company going electric in Portland. Late last year, the city became the second market for BMW’s ReachNow, a Zipcar-like service with a focus on electric vehicles, and a previous initiative by Car2Go that sprinkled electric smart cars onto its rainy streets all the way back in 2012.
In a world where a quarter of cars could drive themselves by 2030, Uber’s decision to take two years to recruit a few hundred EV drivers is more incremental than revolutionary. Still, it shows that the company is implementing both long- and short-term strategies for rethinking transportation, even in the midst of one of the worst PR crises the tech industry has ever known.

119,Full Harvest raises $2 million to stop farmers from tossing ‘ugly’ fruit and veggies,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/12/full-harvest-raises-2-million-to-stop-farmers-from-tossing-ugly-fruit-and-veggies/,2017/04/12,"
Full Harvest, a San Francisco-based startup, has raised $2 million in seed funding to reduce food waste at the farm level. Founded by Christine Moseley, formerly the head of business development for cold-pressed juice makers Organic Avenue, Full Harvest connects farmers with food makers who want to buy the fruit and veggies that grocers deem too ugly to sell in stores.
While she was helping grow Organic Avenue’s retail business, Moseley wanted to figure out how to secure lower-priced organic produce. It felt strange that her company was buying picture perfect fruits and vegetables knowing they’d soon be cold-pressed into juices. Organic Avenue also paid a high price for that pretty produce, driving the cost of its healthful juices above $10.
But Moseley’s true a-ha moment came when she was visiting an organic, romaine lettuce farm, she said: “I was standing with beautiful green romaine leaves up to my calves. The farmers were throwing out all these crunchy, green leaves because they were looking for just the perfect heads of lettuce for the stores.”
World awareness of food waste has increased in recent years, partly owing to better tools to study the phenomenon. In 2014, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization released startling research that found at least one-third of food produced each year is wasted, and saving just one-quarter of it could feed the world’s starving people. That same report pointed out food wasted on the farm level in industrialized nations was a major culprit. That’s when Moseley started Full Harvest.
Startups and reports like this are making a cultural impact. By now, groceries including Sainsbury’s and Tesco in the UK, and some Whole Foods Markets in the US, are starting to sell a limited amount of twisted carrots, twinned strawberries and lumpy potatoes, for example. But farms still waste 20% to 40% of produce that they grow because it does not fit grocers’ cosmetic standards.
Greater and immediate demand for “ugly” fruit can be unlocked by tapping into other markets, Moseley believes, like companies that make juice, soups and sauces, baby food, frozen foods and even pet foods. Full Harvest is not alone in its mission. Its competition includes regional food nonprofits like Borderlands Food Bank that divert produce before it goes to a landfill, and other tech startups, most directly Boston-based Spoiler Alert. Spoiler Alert helps large food makers sell, or donate, what would be wasted.
Full Harvest’s seed investors included: Wireframe Ventures. BBG Ventures, Early Impact Ventures, Impact Engine, Radicle, Astia and Joanne Wilson. The deal represents a first from Radicle’s new agriculture-focused fund. Radicle’s CEO and Managing Partner Kirk Haney said, “Now, it’s all about market adoption for Full Harvest. As they get more farmers and growers on the sell side, and buyers on the marketplace, they will start to have a bigger impact, and experience the ‘network effect’ we see in other marketplaces whether that’s Alibaba, Amazon Prime or Rent the Runway.”
Moseley said her company will use its funding to add new features and functionality to its platform, to expand their team from 10 to about 20 employees over the next year and to let food industry players know they now have a means to curb food waste at the farm level.

120,"A $150 million fund, The Engine, will back startups others find ‘too hard’",https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/09/a-150-million-fund-the-engine-will-back-startups-others-find-too-hard/,2017/04/09,"
A fund and accelerator for advanced technology startups, The Engine, closed its debut fund at a robust $150 million this week, according to its president, CEO and managing partner, Katie Rae. Last year, TechCrunch reported that MIT was investing $25 million into The Engine, becoming the anchor LP for the fund.
While The Engine is not owned and operated by the private research university, it has strong ties with MIT. Several of its board members and advisers are faculty and staff at MIT. Additionally, startups backed by The Engine can use the fund’s booking app, The Engine Room, to rent or get access to labs, equipment and other resources at MIT.
Rae is careful to note, however, that The Engine will invest in teams and technologies that hail from a variety of industry and academic backgrounds, not just from the MIT ecosystem. The Engine Room, which is a unique resource to the fund’s portfolio companies, also helps founders and technologists get access to equipment and facilities at organizations beyond MIT in the greater Boston area.
Rae said, “My philosophy on working with founders is, and with this fund will be, bet early, stay their ally through the long period of ‘figuring it out,’ and be willing to look at things that other people would find too hard or unusual.”
Most venture firms start out with far less capital to manage in a debut fund. Rae is a seasoned, early-stage investor and technologist, having previously led funds like Techstars Boston and Project 11. Her reputation helped The Engine close a sizable debut fund, one that looks more akin to the third or fourth “vintage” for a typical software-focused fund.
The Engine’s focus also justifies a large capital pool to invest in startups. Rae said, “We hit a nerve.” She explained that it typically costs more to start an advanced tech company than it does to start even the most ambitious B2B or consumer app. Her firm is interested in everything from advanced materials and manufacturing technologies to medical devices, robotics, artificial intelligence, nuclear energy, fusion and more, Rae says.
Products or services built using advanced technologies and nascent scientific discoveries can take a longer time to prototype and test. Founders building these businesses often have a harder time finding a place to work and test their inventions than their peers in software, and navigating licensing or other business services specific to advanced tech. It’s not as easy to get a bench in a lab, or access to high-end equipment and testing facilities as it is to book a desk at a co-working space. And, of course, there’s always a risk that technology or science that works well in a controlled environment may not scale to work as well as hoped in commercial applications.
For this and other reasons, few venture funds have been willing to primarily invest in very early-stage, advanced-tech companies. Instead, they optimize their investments around companies that have already “de-risked” their technology, commercialized it to an extent, and optimized their business for growth rather than, say, ongoing tech and science breakthroughs.
The Engine stands alongside a few other firms that do early-stage deals in hard-tech startups, like Breakout Labs or SOSV, and firms focused on one technology type like Grishin Robotics, a $100 million VC fund. Rae said she hopes that the tools and services that The Engine works to secure for its portfolio founders lower the cost of business for them, and ultimately encourage more entrepreneurs to work on so-called “hard tech.”

121,This Porsche-based electric supercar has a 215-mile range and crazy acceleration,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/06/this-porsche-based-electric-supercar-has-a-215-mile-range-and-crazy-acceleration/,2017/04/06,"
Austrian EV tuner Kreisel is making a name for itself in the world of high-performance electric conversions. After creating a purely electric Mercedes G-Class with Arnold Schwarzenegger, the company has now revealed the EVEX 910e, a converted Porsche 910 that has a fully electric drive train, max speeds north of 185 mph, a 0 to 60 time of under 2.5 seconds and more.
The electric supercar is street legal, and was developed in partnership with EVEX Fahrzeugbau GmbH, a car maker that focuses specifically on 1970s and 80s vintage sports cars. The car can be bought, in limited quantities, provided you have considerable resources: It’s priced at a lofty 1 million euros.
Kreisel’s conversion gives the EVEX 910e 490HP via its electric motor, while producing zero emissions. It features a unique 2-speed transmission created by the Kreisel brothers, which can also be purchased separately. The car’s max range of around 215 miles on battery power is described as “realistic” by the company, rather than guided by official measurement systems like the EPA standard. Rapid charging can quickly boost the power, and it’s been built so that when paired with a home solar installation, it can act as a battery and store power to feed back into the house.

122,"Ford to bring plug-in hybrid to China in 2018, targeting mostly electrified lineup by 2025",https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/06/ford-to-bring-plug-in-hybrid-to-china-in-2018-targeting-mostly-electrified-lineup-by-2025/,2017/04/06,"
Ford is going to be focusing on electrification across its lineup in China, with plans to electrify most of its vehicle offerings in the country by 2025, Reuters reports. The long-term plan will begin with the launch of a plug-in hybrid electric sedan called the Mondeo Energi with local partner Changanin China in 2018, and then a fully electric SUV sometime within the next five years, Ford says.
The electric rollout makes sense given the mandate set by the Chinese government to encourage the development and sale of electric vehicles, alongside aggressive targets for vehicle fuel economy and emissions limits, along with subsidies available for automakers who embrace alternative, clean fuel systems.
China announced tighter restrictions on electric vehicles and new-energy cars (the category of vehicles in China that includes plug-in hybrids) in January, but these were designed to discourage startups and other smaller companies from venturing into the market in search of subsidies when they couldn’t deliver actual quality vehicles. The change in practice is actually likely to benefit automakers like Ford, by avoiding a market crowded with low quality entrants that still woo potential customers by undercutting on price.

123,"Tesla now worth more than GM, making it the most valuable U.S. automaker",https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/04/tesla-now-worth-more-than-gm-making-it-the-most-valuable-u-s-automaker/,2017/04/04,"
Tesla is trading up again today, after a strong run yesterday that saw its total market cap value leapfrog Ford’s. It passed GM’s market cap on Tuesday, meaning it’s now the most valuable U.S. automaker as measured by the stock market’s standards.
It looked quite likely that this was going to happen yesterday, and Tesla’s stock has been on a tear following its report that both car production and car deliveries were up during the first quarter of the year. The big established U.S. automakers, by contrast, had bad news to report for first quarter vehicle sales in the U.S., which makes Tesla look like a strong growth stock and competitors look like stable performers, at best.
Tesla’s stock is buoyed in large part by its potential: The company has been readying to launch its Model 3 electric vehicle, with a price tag starting at $35,000 U.S. before tax incentives for green vehicles. Demand is incredibly strong, with around 373,000 pre-orders as of May last year. So far, it seems on target to meet its goal of beginning shipment this year, and even delivering some of the first vehicles by the end of 2017.
Tesla was trading up around 1.8 percent as of this writing, with a stock price of $303.89 per share and a total market cap of $53.06 billion, while GM was tracking at around $34.40 per share, with a total market cap of $49.80 billion.

124,Graphene used to sieve salts from seawater,https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/04/graphene-used-to-sieve-salts-from-seawater/,2017/04/04,"
Scientists continue to explore the potential of graphene, aka the one-atom thin sheet of bonded carbon atoms that was created more than a decade ago after researchers first peeled a few layers off a block of graphite with some Scotch Tape — before going on to refine their technique until a sheet just a single atom thick was produced.
The nanomaterial has been posited for all sorts of potentially revolutionary uses, from faster, thinner and even transparent electronics; to biotech implants; to better battery capacity. Now researchers at the University of Manchester say they have come up with a method for controlling the permeation of graphene oxide membranes so they can act as a sieve to desalinate seawater.
By controlling the size of the pores in the membranes the team was able to prevent common salts passing through the material — turning seawater into drinking water.
While graphene has previously been demonstrated for filtering small nanoparticles, organic molecules and even large salts, the challenge with common salts found in seawater is their small size. Graphene membranes also swell in size when immersed in water — meaning smaller sieves were required in order to block these common salts.
The team at Manchester say they used physical confinement to control the interlayer spacing within graphene laminates immersed in water — enabling them to achieve what they describe as “accurate and tunable ion sieving”, and to provide a sieve size smaller than the diameters of hydrated ions.
And while they found that permeation rates for the membranes decrease exponentially with decreasing sieve size, they also report that water transport itself is only “weakly affected” — meaning the filtered water flows through the membrane relatively quickly; an important factor if the aim is to develop affordable desalination technology.
As well as potential uses for desalination, the team envisages wider industrial applications for “on-demand filtration capable of filtering out ions according to their sizes”. Their research is detailed in a paper published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology.
Commenting in a statement, one of the researchers, Professor Rahul Nair, said: “Realisation of scalable membranes with uniform pore size down to atomic scale is a significant step forward and will open new possibilities for improving the efficiency of desalination technology.
“This is the first clear-cut experiment in this regime. We also demonstrate that there are realistic possibilities to scale up the described approach and mass produce graphene-based membranes with required sieve sizes.”
Scientists at the university, which houses the £61M National Graphene Institute research center, have also been looking at using graphene membranes for gas separation, such as filtering carbon dioxide molecules from power station flue gases — hinting at a possible route for enabling economic carbon capture and storage at scale.

125,Mercedes-Benz speeds up the launch timeline for 10 new electric vehicles,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/29/mercedes-benz-speeds-up-the-launch-timeline-for-its-10-new-electric-vehicles/,2017/03/29,"
Mercedes-Benz had already committed to launch 10 new electric vehicle models within the next decade, but now it’s looking to launch them by 2022, which is at least three years earlier than it had previously discussed. Mercedes sees the shift to electric as a more urgent one than it anticipated, and wants to lead, rather than follow as the industry makes this shift.
Bloomberg reports that Daimler-owned Mercedes-Benz will put over $10 billion into its effort to bring the new vehicles to market, and that the transition will require “fundamental” changes at the automaker according to Daimler Chairman Manfred Bischoff, who discussed the revised timeline at a company shareholder meeting in Berlin on Wednesday.
Emissions pressures are one cause, as Daimler has been affected by the diesel’s fallout among automakers after the Volkswagen scandal. The electrification efforts also help with long-term goals, including fielding reliable autonomous vehicles and fleets. Daimler’s multiple mobility service initiatives include car2go, Moovel and Mytaxi, all of whose models would benefit from improvements in EV range and affordability.

126,Shared EV access is expanding in Portland,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/28/shared-ev-access-is-expanding-in-portland/,2017/03/28,"
Portland, Oregon, has started a pilot program to bring car sharing and alternative fuels to low-income neighborhoods where residents might not consider either type of transportation accessible. A partnership between electric-vehicle advocates at Drive Oregon, local utility Pacific Power and the Hacienda Community Development Corporation formed to bring three used Honda Fit EVs and chargers to the Vista de Rosas affordable housing apartment complex.
In communities like Portland, where electric vehicles were adopted pretty quickly and the infrastructure to support them is growing rapidly, pre-owned EVs are not hard to find. They’re also far less expensive than new EVs, even when you figure in the federal tax credit. And they’re cheaper to operate than gasoline vehicles. According to Drive Oregon, fueling and maintaining an EV is about a quarter the cost of a gasoline vehicle.
It’s not unusual for lower-income communities to have higher rates of air pollution and the health impacts that come along with that. These communities are often close to highways and industrial areas; Vista de Rosas is near a busy arterial road and Portland International Airport. Adding shared EVs to the neighborhood reduces emissions for the neighborhood, at least a little. There’s certainly room to improve.
Charging stations were installed at the apartment complex by CarCharging Group to make recharging as convenient as possible and keep the cars in rotation. The cars can be rented by visiting the peer-to-peer site Turo.com.
Keeping shared EVs charged has been a challenge for other businesses. Part of the car2go fleet in Portland was electrified a few years ago, but the service had to abandon the EV idea when it became apparent that the cars were out of rotation for too long while they recharged.
The neighborhood where Vista de Rosas is located in Portland is served by car2go, though it sits in a far corner of the service area. There are fewer shared cars available at the edges; the bulk of the vehicles are in the downtown core of the city. Offering a small fleet of shared EVs in a neighborhood like this one brings the benefits of both car sharing and alternative fuels for errands, appointments and commutes where public transportation can be inconvenient and car ownership can strain a budget.

127,Samsung will sell a refurbished version of the Note 7 to address environmental concerns,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/27/samsung-note-7-refurbished/,2017/03/27,"
The final chapter of Samsung’s lengthy Note 7 saga apparently has yet to be written. Following pressure from environmental groups that culminated with a on-site protester at the company’s Mobile World Congress press event, Samsung has confirmed its intentions to re-release the Note 7 back into the wild in refurbished form.
After announcing last year that it would simply “safely dispose of the phones,” the company today addressed plans to offer them back to the public in a newer, safer form. The move is an attempt to address vocal environmental concerns over its initial plans to trash a whole bunch of handsets all at once, no matter how safe it insisted the process would be.
“The objective of introducing refurbished devices is solely to reduce and minimize any environmental impact,” a spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch. Samsung is still hammering out the details of the resale, which will depend on, among other things, conversations with carriers and local authorities.
Though the company did hasten to add that it won’t be bringing the handset back to the States in refurbished form. “The product details including the name, technical specification and price range will be announced when the device is available,” the statement continues. “Samsung will not be offering refurbished Galaxy Note 7 devices for rent or sale in the US.”


Great news! Because of your action, Samsung will recycle MILLIONS of recalled Galaxy Note 7 phones. https://t.co/q1qFwbUIHM #SaveTheGalaxy pic.twitter.com/VABLsXvh2a
— Greenpeace USA (@greenpeaceusa) March 27, 2017



The device is rumored to be arriving with a smaller capacity battery, in order to avoid the mistakes that got the company in hot water with two separate recalls during the seemingly endless saga, though Samsung is also apparently still working on those spec specifics.
Of course, this is likely the last thing (or second to last, perhaps) the company wants to be discussing during such an important week for the brand. On Wednesday, Samsung’s set to announce the Galaxy S8, its first major release since everything went down with the Note 7.
Samsung has spent the months in the lead up to the release of its new handset pushing its newly instituted safety precautions, starting with a global press conference in which it discussed its findings and culminating with an aggressive ongoing ad campaign. At the very least, it’s likely managed to avoid a repeat of February’s press conference protester.

128,Faraday Future cancels plans to build an assembly factory in California,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/27/faraday-future-cancels-plans-to-build-an-assembly-factory-in-california/,2017/03/27,"
Faraday Future, the would-be Tesla rival facing well-documented challenges in terms of capitalization and efforts to bring its first production vehicle to market, has scrapped plans to construct an assembly facility and “experience center” (read: showroom) in Vallejo, California on Mare Island. The car maker had already secured a negotiating agreement with the Vallejo city council regarding the site, but the company has been scaling back some of its ambitions in the interest of protecting its core interests.
Faraday’s planned North Bay site would’ve been its second assembly plant, intended to begin operation sometime after its Nevada factory maximized its own production capacity. The Nevada plant has faced its own challenges, after the 3 million-square-foot, $1 billion facility saw work stop on its construction late last year due to contractor non-payment. The Nevada facility plans have been reset, with a more modest 650,000- square-foot facility planned for completion sometime this fall. Faraday says it’ll resume work on this Vegas facility shortly.
The electric car company hasn’t closed the door entirely on future potential projects with Vallejo, noting in a statement to TechCrunch that it “would like to thank the City and its officials for their generosity and professionalism throughout this process, and looks forward to exploring future opportunities with the City.” But despite an optimistic launch of the FF 91 at CES earlier this year, its first production target vehicle, it’s unclear where the future will lead for Faraday.
A Faraday spokesperson noted that while it found through its initial study that the Mare Island site was appropriate for its needs, its focus is now on the North Las Vegas facility, for which construction efforts will resume “soon.” The full statement from Faraday is included below:

Faraday Future (FF) has an update on its planned manufacturing facility and user experience center on North Mare Island in Vallejo. Due to the new strategy to focus corporate efforts on development of its first production vehicle and plant in North Las Vegas, FF has decided to end its Exclusive Right to Negotiate (ERN) with the City of Vallejo. FF will stay in contact with the City, and remains interested in acquiring land on North Mare Island in the future. FF would like to thank the City and its officials for their generosity and professionalism throughout this process, and looks forward to exploring future opportunities with the City.
As part of its due diligence, FF conducted various technical studies to assess the Island for development feasibility. The 157-acre North Mare Island site was found adequate to support development of a manufacturing facility and user experience center, and the results of these studies will be shared with the City as part of the original agreement.
FF’s new multi-phased manufacturing strategy in Nevada is designed to bring FF 91, the company’s flagship vehicle, to production more quickly, allowing FF to fill vehicle reservations that were collected following the car’s launch at CES 2017.
FF plans to restart construction at the North Las Vegas site very soon.

129,London’s social impact accelerator BGV plans seed fund,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/27/londons-social-impact-accelerator-bgv-plans-seed-fund/,2017/03/27,"
London-based “social impact” accelerator Bethnal Green Ventures, which backs pre-seed startups with ideas for using tech to tackle social and/or environmental problems, has taken £1.3 million in funding from three social tech and innovation funders: Big Society Capital, Nominet Trust and Nesta.
BVG says its intention with the new raise, its third, is to support social impact startups through more of their first steps — ideally up to seed stage in the future, not just helping teams accelerate early-stage “tech for good” ideas.
At this point, BVG has invested a total of £1.4 million in 86 startups since first opening for applications back in March 2012. Of those, it says 56 companies are still active, with its portfolio having collectively raised more than £23 million in further funding, and the businesses having an estimated 6.5 million people using their products and services.
The fund’s current model combines a twice-yearly, 12-week accelerator program in which chosen startups receive a £20,000 investment (in exchange for 6 percent equity), along with mentoring and access to co-working space in London.
Last year it also expanded to be able to offer a further £50,000 to startups in the cohort. But it’s evidently hoping to go a stage further still — aiming to create a seed fund to support more companies to the next stage.
It says the funding it’s taking now will be used to develop the planned “later stage impact investment products,” as well as for expanding its operations and building further partnerships — presumably to help it raise the capital for the hoped-for seed fund.
A BVG spokeswoman confirmed it will also have “more capacity” to do investments up to £50,000 in its cohort startups, “usually in the form of a convertible note.” She said the plan is to do 20 accelerator-stage investments this year, plus 10 to 12 follow-on investments.
Commenting on the raise in a statement, BGV CEO Paul Miller, added: “We’ve proved our accelerator model works, but it’s not enough on its own. Startups require ongoing support and funding to scale up their operations, this is especially true for startups focused on social impact. Last year we expanded our offer by being able to invest up to £50,000 in great teams after the accelerator stage. This year we’re planning a fund to be able to back alumni and other tech for good ventures with next stage capital. This will help to plug a notable hole in seed-stage impact investment available to startups in the tech for good space.”
BVG’s spokeswoman said that when it comes to the social impact funding space, it’s “often” the lead investor role that’s missing. “Angels are great and really plugging a gap but someone needs to set the terms, and we feel we can do that, especially in our role as an impact investor,” she told us.
In terms of which “tech for good” early-stage startups face the biggest funding gap challenge, she said it’s a problem across the board, but also noted it can be more of an issue for those with “large slow moving customers” — such as local authorities or the U.K.’s National health Service — or else those with “vulnerable users requiring a responsible approach to growth.”
The fund’s broad themes within its “social impact” mission remain health, education, sustainability and democracy. But the spokeswoman said it’s also working with a few partners to target some specific areas.
“For example we’re looking at startups targeting the gig economy and ways to improve prospects for low paid workers. We’re also interested in solutions for young people facing multiple disadvantages,” she added.
One BVG portfolio company we covered recently is Fairphone: a European smartphone startup that’s created a modular phone design aimed at encouraging users to hold onto the same device for longer — thereby reducing the environmental impact associated with owning a smartphone.
Another, DrDoctor, is a hospital booking system which BVG says is used by more than 4 million NHS patients in the U.K.
U.S. startup factory Y Combinator has also, in recent years, placed more of an emphasis on supporting startups aiming to have a wide social and economic impact.

130,Arable raises $4.25 million to demystify farming with sensors and data,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/27/arable-raises-4-25-million-to-demystify-farming-with-sensors-and-data/,2017/03/27,"
Arable has raised $4.25 million for solar-powered sensors and software to help farmers produce more food with fewer resources, and more accurately predict their yields. Middleland Capital and S2G Ventures led the Series A investment in Arable, joined by Princeton, New Jersey-based Chase Field, SparkLabs and Cantos VC.
Believe it or not, farmers in the U.S. have faced a labor shortage for years. U.S. citizens aren’t drawn to agriculture the way they were in previous generations, and everything from a complex visa program to anti-immigrant hate groups keep people from coming here to join the agricultural work force. The labor trend has pushed farmers to automate some of the tasks done by agronomists and field workers in the past, using software, robotics and IoT devices like Arable’s.
Arable’s sensors constantly gather data about plant health, density, light and weather. The company boasts that they precisely measure more than 40 different, relevant data types, a more comprehensive amount than other IoT “smart farming” devices that tend to focus on just one issue in the field, like irrigation or soil tension.
It’s not necessary to send people walking across acres as often if you have a machine eye on the field. And with more accurate forecasting, which is possible by collecting and analyzing that data, farms aren’t as likely to over- or under-staff their operations as harvest approaches.
Farmers’ uptake of technology is also driven by the rising cost of land, supplies (like seeds or fertilizer) and water. “Smart farming” and “precision agriculture” let farmers make decisions about what needs tweaking in the field before it’s too late, reigning in irrigation where sensors can tell that conditions are humid enough, for example, or working to connect with more food producers or other buyers if they are about to deliver a bumper crop.
Arable CEO Adam Wolf said his company’s Arable Mark (formerly known as the Pulsepod) and Arable Insights platform are valuable across different types of farms. The data also becomes valuable to food buyers, not just farmers.
Wolf said, “The farmer wants to sell. The processor wants to distribute. The grocer wants to buy it. Nobody wants a deal not to go through. We are in a position to gather and analyze more data than anyone. We can see things in the field that you’ve never witnessed before, like the onset of blooms or development of clusters and coloring. This amounts to helping all parties reduce supply chain risk.”
Asked if he’s worried farming will go inside, as “vertical farms” and technology to control them are rapidly advancing, Wolf said, “As far as I’m concerned, you don’t get any cheaper than the sun. And you can’t beat 10 acres in Salinas.” Arable intends to use its Series A capital for hiring, especially more scientists and engineers, and to ramp up production of its sensors.

131,Japanese authorities decry ongoing robot failures at Fukushima,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/25/japanese-authorities-decry-ongoing-robot-failures-at-fukushima/,2017/03/25,"
Six years ago, a massive earthquake, consequent tsunami and nuclear crisis struck Japan. International organizations rushed to help the country’s devastated residents, and to figure out how to clean up Fukushima Daiichi, the wrecked nuclear power plant. Robots offered a ray of hope amid unfathomable loss. At least they did, until recently.
As the Asahi Shimbun reported yesterday, members of Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority are now urging plant operators Tokyo Electric Power Company to find new technology and methods to aid in the cleanup. Robots keep getting fried on their missions, literally from radiation damage, or stranded on-site wasting precious money and time.
The implication is that, perhaps, the clean up will move faster if Tepco’s energy and the government’s money is redirected to chemistry, biology, and so-called “safe containment,” building some sort of structure around Fukushima Daiichi like the “sarcophagus” around Chernobyl. Or perhaps humans need to trust AI to move robots through some of their tasks. All of the robots deployed in the cleanup effort have been remote-operated by humans, so far. The government watchdog’s critical comments followed the latest robo-fail revealed by Tepco.
The PMORPH survey robot is being used to clean up Fukushima.
On March 23 the company said it had attempted to send a survey robot into a containment vessel to find fuel debris, information it needs to decommission the plant. But the PMORPH survey robot, developed by Hitachi-GE Nuclear Energy and the International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning (IRID), couldn’t get its cameras to the predetermined location. As a result, it only sent back a partial report.
Just one month earlier, Tepco aborted a mission using a Toshiba “scorpion” robot that was built to scramble over rubble, capture images and data inside the plant’s facilities. The robot could tolerate up to 1,000 sieverts of radiation. And yet, it had trouble within the hostile environs of the number 2 reactor where it was dispatched.
These followed a string of earlier robot losses at the plant going back to the Quince 1, the first robot to enter the facility after the disaster. Developed by the Chiba Institute of Technology, the International Rescue System Institute, and Tohoku University in Japan, Quince went into the power plant’s reactor 2 building where it measured radiation levels, collected dust samples and video footage. It ran several missions but eventually disconnected from its communications cable and got stranded within the building.

This “scorpion robot” was built to investigate inside containment vessels at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.
It’s not like anyone thought it would be easy to make robots capable of finding and retrieving molten nuclear fuel, or decommissioning and decontaminating a nuclear power plant. Japanese researchers have been trying to create robots with these capabilities since the 80s, as Timothy Hornyak wrote in the journal Science last year. Robots remain incredibly tantalizing technology.
With cameras, dosimeters, and other tools on board, robots can ostensibly go where conditions would prove fatal to humans. If they were strong and agile enough, they might be able to bring core samples up for scientists to test, or find and plug leaks, clear paths and scour away radioactive materials. The ultimate task would be for robots to identify and retrieve some 600 tons of molten nuclear fuel and debris from Fukushima.
Despite the nuclear watchdog’s most recent admonition, many robots, even the fried ones, have been helpful in what little progress has been made in cleaning up the site.
iRobot’s PackBot 510 E.T.
Early on, iRobot’s ground-based PackBot and Warrior robots, and Honeywell’s T-Hawk drones helped TEPCO get a handle on radioactivity and conditions around its facilities, including around damaged reactors within weeks of the disaster. Swimming and crawling robots, also developed by Hitachi and GE Nuclear energy, were used in a 2014 mission to capture images and readings from within a damaged reactor.
Still, with every failed or aborted mission, every $1 million spent, it gets harder to tell people devastated by a crisis that robots are their greatest hope. Japan’s 3/11 crisis killed tens of thousands, left thousands missing and displaced a quarter of a million people. As radiation first gushed from the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear plant, millions of residents were left mourning without electricity or water through cold and wet, end-of-winter weather.
More than half of those who fled or were evacuated from the area have no plans to come back, even still, according to Japanese government surveys. Scientific studies have concluded that certain areas are safe for residents’ return. But there’s not much in the way of schools, stores or other critical community support around Fukushima, and fears linger.  The Japanese government estimates the cleanup effort will cost $189 billion and will take decades.
Let’s hope the next “step change” in technology, whether in robotics or another promising area, will hasten the Fukushima recovery, and prevent nuclear disasters from ever happening again.

132,Tesla’s solar roof tiles will be available to order starting in April,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/24/teslas-solar-roof-tiles-will-be-available-to-order-starting-in-april/,2017/03/24,"
The Tesla solar roof tiles the company unveiled last year, which look like regular roof tiles and yet have roughly equivalent efficiency of traditional solar power gathering cells, will be up for order starting in April, according to Tesla CEO Elon Musk.
These are a key step in Tesla’s combined vision for its solar energy generation and storage business, along with its electric vehicle operations. The solar tiles are aimed at popularizing the tech, by turning it from something that appeals to hardcore techies and green energy enthusiasts, to a practical option for everyday homeowners just looking to either save money, increase the resale value of their homes, or just take more direct control over their energy needs.
Tesla’s solar tile designs include four visual styles, which mimic four different types of traditional roofing material, but the company said that only one or two of these will be available at first. The cost of the roof solution will be at or under that of a traditional new roof for a home – even before you factor in energy cost savings, according to news shared by Musk in November.
Installations won’t necessary start in April – it’s likely that Tesla will build up a queue via pre-orders and then begin installation later on. Volume production is expected to start at some point in 2017.

133,"Tesla Model 3 is ‘just a smaller, more affordable’ Model S, says Elon Musk",https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/24/tesla-model-3-is-just-a-smaller-more-affordable-model-s-says-elon-musk/,2017/03/24,"
The Tesla Model 3 is not a product iteration along the lines of successive iPhones, Elon Musk clarified on Twitter on Friday. Instead, it’s a “smaller model affordable version of Model S” with less range, less power and fewer features, according to the Tesla CEO. The Model S is still going to be the leader in terms of it technological capabilities — so think more iPhone SE than iPhone 7 versus iPhone 6s.
Musk’s tweets were sparked by observation that many watching for the release of the Model 3, which is set for later this year, would be a kind of next-generation Tesla vehicle. Per the CEO, it’s more like Tesla will be leveraging its existing and past technical achievements, adding in the benefits of having nailed down their production processes to build them affordably at scale.


Model 3 is just a smaller, more affordable version of Model S w less range & power & fewer features. Model S has more advanced technology.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 24, 2017



This is where the frequent Tesla comparisons to Apple start to break down a bit, and we’re reminded that, at heart, it’s a car company. Automakers typically debut new tech in their high-end line, and then bring this to their more mass-market models over time — often spanning many years or even decades — as costs associated with manufacturing decline and make it possible to achieve decent margins with lower retail prices.
Musk also reiterated the reasoning behind the car’s name — the intent was to call it the Model E, but Ford blocked this because of its trademark on that name. The crude humor behind the idea was to have the names of Tesla’s first three models spell out “S–E-X.” Awkward dad joke CEO at the height of his craft.

134,Zero Motorcycles CTO Abe Askenazi on the future of two-wheeled EVs,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/23/zero-motorcycles-cto-abe-askenazi-on-the-future-of-two-wheeled-evs/,2017/03/23,"
Electric cars and buses have already begun to take over the world, as evidenced by daily sightings of EV brands like Tesla, Prius, Bolt and Proterra on U.S. roads. But two-wheeled EVs are still a rare sight. The motorcycle industry has been much slower to put out all-electric and hybrid models relative to peers in automotive.
Big brands like Harley, Honda and Ducati don’t have EV motorcycles on the market today, though customers have indicated interest when they’ve teased electric concepts. And a few startups have failed to make electric bikes that could give combustion engine models a run for their money.
Mission Motors went bankrupt. Brammo put its Empulse EV motorcycles out there to some fanfare, but the small Oregon-based startup sold its bike business to Polaris. The parent company of Victory Motorcycles, Polaris eventually killed off the Empulse. And Brammo now sells power systems to other vehicle and equipment makers.
Survivors and newcomers are still churning out EV motorcycles, though. They include Zero Motorcycles, Lightning Motorcycle and Alta Motors in the U.S., Energica Motor in Italy and China’s Evoke Motorcycles. All are helping to awaken market demand. According to forecasts from ID Tech Ex, the market for smaller electric vehicles, including motorcycles, will comprise about 5 percent of overall EV sales, generating some $35 billion annually by 2027.
Zero Motorcycles CTO Abe Askenazi.
TechCrunch recently caught up with Zero Motorcycles CTO Abe Askenazi, who has been in the motorcycle industry for about two decades, to get his take on what could make electric motorcycles the first choice for riders.
Askenazi said right now, a lot of Zero Motorcycles’ customers buy the company’s EV bikes alongside market-leading V-twins and V-4s. To him, that indicates Zero’s bikes perform at the same or better levels as riders’ long-held favorites.
Besides that, he said, electric bikes are quiet, so riders can hear what’s happening around them, and won’t disturb the peace, which their neighbors appreciate. That quietude is one reason police departments buy Zero Motorcycles for their fleets. They can ride at any hour, and approach suspects stealthily if they drive electric.
Of course, electricity costs less than gas most of the world over. That’s appealing to a certain set of riders — so is the ability to power your bike with solar or wind-generated electricity for those most eco-minded motorcycle enthusiasts.
Zero Motorcycles’ dual-sport electric, the Zero DS.
Zero’s today makes everything from lightweight “hot rods” to sporty off-road models that cost from $8,495 to $15,995. Appreciated for their acceleration, speed, control and easy-to-read instruments, in the past the bikes drew complaints around range. The company has worked hard to improve its battery tech, however, and some bikes in Zero’s 2017 lineup promise 200 miles per charge. That compares to e-motorcycles with a 40-mile range made by Zero just a few years ago.
“Optimization of chemistry has gotten us here. The beautiful thing is that batteries are plug-and-play. When that battery comes that will give you 1,000 miles, we’ll be able to use it,” the CTO said. “Where the industry is going though is not so much a bigger battery to go further between charges, but faster charging so you can go grocery shopping, plug it in, come back and then you’re ready to go again.”
Over time, batteries will take up less weight and space on e-motorcycles, beyond what we can even envision today, the CTO said. That will leave room for cargo and other components, potentially. Already, Zero Motorcycles S and DS bikes give riders a large storage space behind the batteries. “You gain a lot of practicality with this bike,” Askenazi said. Lighter-weight and stronger materials will also transform design, he predicts.

135,Causes of the global water crisis and 12 companies trying to solve it,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/22/causes-of-the-global-water-crisis-and-12-companies-trying-to-solve-it/,2017/03/22,"
It’s World Water Day. Time to wake up and take shorter showers. That is, if we’re fortunate enough to have them. Water scarcity and pollution are persistent global problems. According to End Water Poverty, some 663 million people around the world have absolutely no reliable access to clean, safe water year-round. And two-thirds of the world population faces water scarcity for at least one month every year.
In the wealthy US, we’re facing a different kind of water crisis largely of our own making. In 2016 only 9 states reported safe lead levels in their schools’ water supply. Lead and copper contamination can come from irresponsible industry, aging pipes, ineffectual water treatment plants and too little investment in our public water infrastructure.
Droughts and natural disasters can cut off access to potable and sanitary water anywhere in the world, too. Haiti is known as a “pipeless nation,” still recovering from 2010’s catastrophic earthquake and consequent natural disasters. In Haiti, only one-quarter of residents have access to toilets, according to the World Bank. And it’s hard to believe it, but giant freshwater sources in North America like Lake Mead in Arizona or the Colorado River may not be able to keep pumping to residents’ homes and businesses much longer thanks to drought and pollution.
Our daily consumption of water affects future supply, of course. Right now, according to research by WWF, wasteful irrigation systems on farms consume about 70% of the world’s freshwater, over double that of any other industry. By contrast, municipal water represents a mere 8% of global use. Bad irrigation practices in farming can hurt our water in other ways, washing pollutants into rivers, streams or other freshwater ecosystems.
At TechCrunch, we’re lucky to see the hopeful ways that startups, investors and other organizations are working to solve huge problems plaguing humanity with tech, including the global water crisis. Here are 12 to watch:
1. Water Is Life

The nonprofit Water is Life makes and distributes portable water filters that look like big straws. The components inside the straws are “membranes, iodized crystals and active carbon,” which eliminate harmful bacteria and viruses including typhoid, cholera, E. coli, and reduce other harmful particles so people can drink safely wherever they go. Water is Life also creates educational campaigns, and even a VR game, to teach kids why and how they should clean or filter water before they drink from a potentially unsafe source.
2. charity: water

Charity: water is focused on helping people get access to clean water. Founder Scott Harrison has gotten support from the tech community throughout the years, with entrepreneurs like Sean Parker and Michael Birch involved with the organization.
3. The Human Utility: Detroit Water Project 

Backed by Y Combinator, TeeSpring and the Shuttleworth Foundation, The Human Utility is helping low-income families get help paying for their water bills so their taps won’t be turned off by utilities leaving them thirsty in their own homes.
4. WaterSmart

WaterSmart’s software helps the water industry understand what’s happening to every last drop of H2O. It aggregates and analyzes information from millions of water meters, predicts demand, and helps utilities communicate with customers about everything from leaks at home to service or rate changes. WaterSmart is making moves with a recent $7 million raise at a $21 million pre-money valuation.
5. Valor Water

Backed by Y Combinator, Valor Water helps utilities understand who is wasting and who is conserving water among their customers. With that data, they can target rate hikes at water pigs, and cut conservationists a good deal to incentivize responsible water use. The company previously competed in TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield in San Francisco.
6. TOTO

TOTO manufactures high-efficiency toilets and has been named a Water Efficiency Leader by the US Environmental Protection Agency, which lauded its sustainable manufacturing and advocacy efforts. The company’s toilets clean themselves with electrolyzed water after every use. TOTO invited TechCrunch to test-drive their latest bidet-and-toilet model at CES this year, but our reporter declined since he was doing the story on camera.
7. Pluto AI

This company, which was one of our favorites from 500 Startups’ 19th class, is developing an application of deep learning for water management. Pluto.ai uses data and machine learning to predict infrastructure failures and to monitor water usage. The company is striving to reduce operating costs at two of the 10 largest water companies in the world who it counts among its partners today.
8. ImagineH20

Imagine H2O is a water-focused accelerator and fund providing water entrepreneurs with “the resources, insight and visibility to launch and scale successful businesses.” The company’s annual water innovation prize rallies entrepreneurs to focus on solving different water-related problems with their technology. This year’s winner, Utilis, uses satellite imagery and big data analytics to find leaks in underground water supplies to large, urban markets so that cities can stop them and save that water for residential use.
9. XPV Water Partners
A Toronto-based venture firm called XPV Water Partners has developed a specialization around startups in the water industry, one of the most regulated sectors in every nation. Its portfolio includes microbial monitoring tech startup LuminUltra, water reclamation and reuse venture Natural Systems Utilities, and Shenandoah Growers, a grower of organic herbs that uses 90% less water than required with traditional farming methods, but no photo-sharing or dating apps.
10. Planet Water Foundation

This nonprofit installs water filtration systems in rural communities and at schools around the world so they can have clean, safe drinking water. The systems, called Aqua Towers, trap harmful particles, and kill bacteria and viruses, providing 1,000 people with 10,000 liters of clean water per unit daily.
11. RWL Water 

New York-based RWL Water builds desalination plants and wastewater treatment systems around the world.  The company works to provide a power supply to customers who are in geographically remote areas but need water to power their communities and businesses. Most recently, RWL acquired a water plant in São Paulo, Brazil, a market that has been struggling to keep its residents and businesses in clean water after a two year, El Niño drought.
12. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is a tour de force supporting tech to solve problems that plague humanity. The foundation’s Water & Sanitation Hygiene Challenge, and Reinvent the Toilet fair award grants to organizations that improve sanitation in the developing world. According to the foundation’s own research, “Better sanitation contributes to economic development, delivering up to $5 in social and economic benefits for every $1 invested through increased productivity, reduced healthcare costs, and prevention of illness, disability, and early death.”

136,Wright Electric unveils its commercial electric plane business,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/21/wright-electric-planes/,2017/03/21,"
Gas is the biggest cost for airlines. The easiest way to reduce these costs? Don’t use gas at all. That was the pitch from Wright Electric, a startup building a commercial passenger plane that runs on batteries and can handle flights under 300 miles. These short-haul trips make up 30 percent of all flights and is a $26 billion market.
Today Wright Electric gave its first preview to the world at Y Combinator’s Demo Day, where Silicon Valley’s most prestigious startup accelerator puts its new companies in front of investors. Wright Electric announced it’s building a 150-seat plane to disrupt the 737 market. It’s struck a partnership with budget British airline EasyJet, which could put its design in the air. And it even showed off its own electric plane in the parking lot.
“This is one of best hard tech teams I’ve seen,” said Michael Seibel, the head of Y Combinator’s accelerator program. Wright Electric hired a team that had been previously funded by NASA to investigate the potential for electric planes, which its co-founder Jeff Engler says puts the startup years ahead of the competition.
Wright Electric co-founder Jeff Engler presents at Y Combinator’s Demo Day.
The plan for exactly how the planes will work depends on advances in battery technology. If batteries get a lot better in the next decade it will go all-electric — and if they don’t, it will use a hybrid system similar to a Chevy Volt. Last year Boeing and Airbus sold 967 planes in the 737 style at about $90 million each. Even replacing a fraction of that market could be a big opportunity.
For now, gas will still be necessary for long-haul flights across the country or the world. But Wright Electric’s technology could make jumps like New York City to Washington, D.C. much cheaper, and potentially more environmentally friendly, depending on where the electricity to charge the batteries comes from.
Wright Electric is only a year old and has a long way to go before its planes are operational. The image above is just a mock-up. But with every airline desperate to reduce costs and undercut the competition, it could fly high once it’s off the ground.

137,Vinsight gives grape and almond growers a high-tech crystal ball,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/20/vinsight-gives-grape-and-almond-growers-a-high-tech-crystal-ball/,2017/03/20,"
Farmers know how hard it is to predict yield accurately. High-value crops like grapes or almonds prove particularly challenging. Farmers expect, and settle for, twenty to forty percent uncertainty with these crops. Vinsight founder and CEO, Megan Nunes, who grew up in the farming business, found that unacceptable.
After almost a decade-long career in the satellite industry, she turned her tech knowledge back home. Her Redwood City, Calif.-based startup now offers forecasting software and data analytics to farmers who are growing almost anything that’s not corn, wheat or soy. While Vinsight did not have permission to name its early customers, the CEO says, it is already working with one of the world’s largest wine making businesses and the world’s second largest producer of almonds.
Rather than installing its own proprietary sensors or weather stations in the filed, or scanning farmland from on high, Vinsight amasses all the data that it can from growers, government agencies and other sources. It analyzes the data in aggregate, and comes to understand when optimum yield is likely or not, based on a wide variety of correlations.
For example, even if you experience a perfect balance of sunny days and rainy ones, if windspeed is high enough, grapes in your vineyard will shatter and won’t be salable. Or, if your decidedly more durable almond trees bloom too quickly, they won’t yield the maximum amount of nuts they could. In an ideal weather year, that could be due to bee flight hours and a lack of pollination.
Nunes said Vinsight has hit a 10% error rate, which is a step in a positive direction, and three-times better than industry standard. Here’s how they make it happen, she said. “What we do is constantly analyze and take in data on a daily basis, including from remote sensors, weather stations and satellites, to identify what is happening on a farm as it correlates with crop performance or yield. We also look at data trends on a ten to twenty year historical series. That means we’ve taken a lot of data out of old Excel files and run it through our system.”
Vinsight will compete for a share of the farmer’s wallet against scores of other agtech providers, including startups like Fruition Sciences or Arable, and others who promise to help farmers accurately predict what will happen in their fields. However, Nunes sees more room for collaboration than anything else. “We give growers insight that improves the bottom line. If you have a great data set, we want to work with you. Now, processors are using us for market research too, asking thigns like will almonds be high or low this year and where? Who do we buy from and how do we hedge our costs?”
Farmers pay Vinsight per acre analyzed, while processors and government offices pay per seat for use of the market data and software. The startup, which launched this week and was part of Y Combinator’s latest batch, is planning to expand beyond California to work with farms in Australia this year, which will help the company keep tweaking its predictive analytics all year, thanks to the juxtaposed growing seasons.

138,"An eBay for grain trading, FarmLead, raises $6.5 million Series A",https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/20/an-ebay-for-grain-trading-farmlead-raises-6-5-million-series-a/,2017/03/20,"
Farmers work to feed the world. Yet somehow, corn, wheat and rice sales are still happening at a local level through antiquated paperwork and phone negotiations. Now, an Ottawa-based startup called FarmLead has raised $6.5 million in venture funding to connect grain producers and buyers automatically online, and help farmers get fair prices for what they grow. The platform is something like an eBay for grains.
Monsanto Growth Ventures led the Series A deal, and was joined by Avrio Ventures, the MaRS Innovation Accelerator Fund and Serra Ventures. MGV investment director Kiersten Stead said, “We see FarmLead as a tool that creates optionality for farmers. That’s what is most important to us. But their platform also gives buyers more choices. They can create a large portfolio of vendors to work with, and get access to a more diverse set of crops than what they had before.”
After they set up a free account, growers or buyers can post sell or buy offers on FarmLead, browse existing offers, sort offers by location or other terms and engage in negotiations. The company generates revenue through transactional fees. The FarmLead app also includes a “forward contracting service and escrow payment option,” which helps growers sell to buyers based on their projected grain yield. Knowing they’ve locked in a buyer helps farms better manage their finances. And for buyers, committing early can help score a good deal.
FarmLead has focused on the North American market, but co-founders Brennan Turner and Alain Goubau often talk about transforming the international grain trade. A growing world population, combined with economic growth throughout Asia, South America and the Middle East, has helped drive demand for grains in recent years. Meanwhile, wheat consumption has generally declined in the U.S. since the 1990s.
Hopefully the adoption of online marketplace and financial technology in agriculture will reduce post-harvest loss and waste of food. “Low capacities to adopt innovations or respond to changing consumption patterns contribute to the post-harvest loss of 1.3 billion [metric] tons of food waste each year,” according to the 2016 Global Food Report from the International Food Policy Research Institute.
Investors expect FarmLead to use their funding for hiring (especially in their Chicago office), marketing and continued product development. “We simply want them to keep making it easier to buy and sell grains,” Stead said.

139,Santa Fe enlists Rubicon Global to curb waste and ramp up recycling,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/17/santa-fe-enlists-rubicon-global-to-curb-waste-and-ramp-up-recycling/,2017/03/17,"
Humans, especially Americans, are kind of slobs. We mess up the Earth by throwing out about 4.5 pounds of garbage per person on average every day. Two-thirds of that waste could be composted, but isn’t. And half of the rest of it could be recycled, according to research from the Duke Nicholas School of the Environment, corroborated by studies from the Global Footprint Network and others.
Now, the city of Santa Fe wants to do something about it. Santa Fe has enlisted tech startup Rubicon Global to figure out what its residents toss in the trash, recycle or send to compost. Using data gathered by garbage collectors and trucks on their normal routes, Rubicon helps municipalities quantify their trash and pinpoint neighborhoods for improvement when they clearly need more education or different waste management services.
Funded by Nima Capital and a number of high-profile angel investors, including actor and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio, Rubicon Global first generated buzz as the “Uber of garbage.” It promised to make garbage pick-ups available on demand, not just at pre-scheduled times.
In its early days, Rubicon generated revenue by helping businesses like restaurant chains or hospitals divert waste from landfills and instead send it to be recycled or used elsewhere. Doing that, businesses avoid “tipping fees” charged by landfills. They also get to ballyhoo their efforts in sustainability for positive PR.
Rubicon’s long-term goal in Santa Fe is to enable garbage hauling on demand, or just when and where it’s needed. But before making any changes to the way it hauls waste, the city wants to get a handle on its own hot mess. Head of public policy at Rubicon, Michael Allegretti, said the company’s app asks garbage collectors to submit notes about anything unusual on a given job.
If a collector can’t complete a weekly pick-up because there’s simply no garbage at an abandoned and boarded-up house, the city learns where flight and blight are happening. If they pick up a trash bin that’s full of recyclable bottles and cans, repeatedly, at the same address, the city can target that home for educational outreach on recycling.
“Cities want to be smart. They want all the data they can get before they make decisions to spend time and money on programs with a constrained budget. We give them the tools to turn their existing assets into the brains of the smart city,” Allegretti said. Its expansion into Santa Fe marks the first time Rubicon Global has struck a municipal-level contract outside of its hometown of Atlanta, CEO Nate Morris said.
Asked if Rubicon is installing new sensors, or robotic arms, into the fleets of trucks it works with, Morris said not yet. The cameras and mobile devices that are already on-board these vehicles do such a good job of gathering data with humans at the wheel that Rubicon hasn’t needed to automate further. However, he noted that Rubicon will always investigate emerging technologies that can help waste management workers do their jobs more efficiently and with less risk.

141,Utilis takes top water innovation prize at Imagine H2O for tech that finds leaks underground,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/16/utilis-takes-top-water-innovation-prize-at-imagine-h2o/,2017/03/16,"
An Israeli tech startup called Utilis has taken top honors at Imagine H2O this year, for technology that can detect underground leaks in underground, potable water supply systems through analysis of satellite imagery. Americans waste 1 trillion gallons of water every year thanks to leaky faucets, faulty sprinkler systems and other small systems. Utilis’ tech can find leaks to systems that are much bigger, serving urban markets, and help utilities to repair them before the waste has a detrimental effect on people living nearby.
Each year, IH2O rallies tech startups to develop solutions for particular problems around our global water supply. This year’s theme was simply, “data.” IH2O President Scott Bryan said, “Data is a building block you must have in water. Communities cannot make big decisions around a desalination plant if they don’t have data about leaks, or how much energy it may takes to move water from point a to point b, for example. Without data you can’t plan, and you can’t do things, big things, in water.”
Judges at the IH2O annual event ranged from Silicon Valley venture investors to technologists from water utilities and large industrials, to sustainability experts and policy makers. All 12 companies invited to be finalists in this competition were accepted into the IH2O accelerator. But Utilis also scored a cash prize of $25,000 and will have the option of free business services and mentorship provided by partners of IH2O.
The announcement of the winning water tech innovators fell on a date when President Donald Trump sent an aggressive budget to Congress seeking to dramatically cut funding for the E.P.A., and the United Nations both of which are running multiple initiatives to study and conserve the world’s clean water supply. For example, the E.P.A. runs regional projects like the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. And the United Nations recognizes access to safe and clean drinking water and water for sanitation are human rights.
That budget is getting pushback. But no matter the outcome, it’s at least heartening to know that if the U.S. government stops supporting such initiatives financially, and otherwise, some (if too few) private sector organizations are banding together to find technological approaches to water conservation, and protection.

Lucid’s first electric vehicle doesn’t cost what you think it does – the company revealed basic pricing information for the Air on its blog, basically just to mute speculation that its price tag would begin north of $100,000. The Lucid Air’s actual price will start at $60,000, hitting $52,500 once you apply the federal tax credit for EV buyers.
That’s for the base model, of course, but the base model sounds relatively well-equipped, with a 240-mile range on a single charge, 400 horsepower from its rear-wheel drive motor and all the sensor and computer hardware on board for a future update to provide autonomous driving.
Lucid’s other base model features include trunks at both front and rear, power front seats, four displays (three of which are touch-sensitive) and a 10 speaker audio system. The upgrades available on higher trim models include 315 and 400 mile batteries, a boost in horsepower up to a max of 1,000 HP, a glass canopy roof and more. Top line models will run north of $100,000, Lucid says, but it’s not revealing exactly how much more.
The first 255 Lucid Air vehicles off the line will be special Launch Edition cars with unique trim, including 315 miles of range, 1,000 horsepower and better in-car audio – these will also be priced above $100,000, but it sounds like they may differ from the general production top trim vehicles in at least a few regards.
Lucid’s already seeking reservations for the Air, with a $2,500 deposit required for the standard production models, and a $25,500 commitment required for those first 255 special edition vehicles.

143,Tesla’s Kauai solar storage facility offers a glimpse of the company’s future,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/10/teslas-kauai-solar-storage-facility-offers-a-glimpse-of-the-companys-future/,2017/03/10,CONTENT ERROR
144,Tesla’s Kauai solar facility will offset 1.6M gallons of fuel use per year,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/08/teslas-kauai-solar-facility-will-offset-1-6m-gallons-of-fuel-use-per-year/,2017/03/08,"

Tesla’s Kauai solar power facility is officially open for business as of Friday, with a 13 MW SolarCity solar farm installation providing power to a Powerpack storage facility with 52 MWh of total capacity. The beauty of the new facility, in terms of the specific needs of the sun-soaked island in the Pacific, is that it can capture energy from the sun during peak daytime production hours, and then keep that power ready for peak consumption hours at night.
This is a relatively new reality for solar power generation, made possible by Tesla’s Powerpack tech, which is essentially the commercial version of its Powerwall home storage batteries. Hawaii is already a big solar power consumer, which makes sense for the same reason it makes sense that the state is such a draw to tourists, too. But Tesla’s initiative is the first to answer the problem of peak production time overlapping almost exactly with times where need for power is at its lowest.
Tesla’s new solar facility in Kauai isn’t going to completely reduce its dependence on fossil fuels — the island will still rely on diesel shipped in to provide some of its power requirements. But the new facility will offset some of that use of dirty burning fuel, reducing overall usage of fossil fuels for power needs by around 1.6 million gallons per year.
The new energy project was developed by Tesla for the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative, and it’s the biggest solar storage facility in the world, according to KIUC president and CEO David Bissell. It occupies a field that was once used to grow sugarcane. The project is a key part of Hawaii’s goal of using 100 percent renewable energy by 2045, and for Tesla, it’s the perfect way to demonstrate how it can deploy these kinds of facilities to fit similar needs around the world.

KIUC’s Tesla solar plant uses Powerpack 2, Tesla’s second-generation commercial storage, which is made at Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada. The project began with an RFP issued by KIUC in 2014, which led to a year of discussions between itself, Tesla and Grove Farms, which owns the land upon which it’s built. In 2016, the companies struck a deal and Solar City brought Tesla in as its storage supplier — then later that same year, Tesla acquired the solar energy provider.
Tesla’s hoping that the example of what it’s done in Kauai will act as a roadmap for what it can do for other commercial energy providers around the world. It’s also a key proof point for why it made sense to tie up Tesla and SolarCity via their merger last year.
Tesla CTO JB Straubel said that the unique aspect, and the most important, with this facility is that it’s the first time that a solar facility can deliver really reliable power delivery 24 hours a day, and operate when it’s needed most. It’s also a necessary step toward achieving 100 percent renewable energy sourcing, he says, since without the ability to defer power delivery the most you can ever hope for is 20 to 30 percent. He added that it’s a sign that they’re ready to truly deliver fully scalable facilities to suit the increasing size of demand across markets.
It can easily scale the other way, too, according to Straubel. He said at the launch that they’re seeing more customers who are looking to Powerpack for single-site energy backup, and also highlighted Powerwall, which offers the same to residential customers.

Straubel also stressed that Tesla wants to provide an “integrated, collaborative approach” to energy production and supply along with utilities, rather than espousing an “either/or approach,” which is a very sensible stance to take when you’re presenting alongside a utility company partner and client.
Hawaii governor David Ige also spoke at the event, highlighting the Hawaiian people’s commitment to renewable energy sources, which he says they see clearly “are the future.” He added that “storage is the challenge” for the state, despite abundance of renewable sources, including geothermal, solar and more. “The challenge is making energy available when the consumer needs it,” Ige said, which is why the project is something that the state found so attractive.
Ige said that he truly believes companies like Tesla who are willing to raise and invest funds in the task of making renewable energy affordable for everyday consumers are the way forward in achieving the state’s 100 percent renewable power goals.

145,John Deere partners with Kespry to bring drones and aerial data to construction and forestry,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/07/john-deere-partners-with-kespry-to-bring-drones-and-aerial-data-to-construction-and-forestry/,2017/03/07,"
Heavy equipment makers Deere & Co., better known as John Deere, have forged a strategic alliance with drone-tech startup Kespry, the companies announced Tuesday in Las Vegas at CONEXPO, an international trade show for the construction industry. The deal could prove a boon for sales of Kespry’s drones and data analytics software. It could help John Deere tap into a new, high-tech means of generating sales and profits in construction and forestry, an area in its overall business that slumped in 2016.
Based in Menlo Park, Kespry helps mining, construction and other businesses put drones to work gathering data and images from on high, then using these to decide where and how to cut costs and improve productivity and safety on job sites. Kespry offers cloud-based software and big data analytics, as well as their own unmanned aerial vehicles. A predecessor that does not have its own hardware to offer but does provide sophisticated software and analytics to the same industries, Airware, has a similar partnership with and an equity investment from Caterpillar.
Through the new partnership, John Deere construction and forestry equipment dealers will offer their customers Kespry Aerial Intelligence systems for use on job sites around the world. Kespry leases its drones but does not sell them outright. John Deere offers a mix of leases and sales.
Why would John Deere equipment users want Kespry’s drones and software? They capture topographic data that can be used to guide projects in road building or maintenance, or to understand volumetrics, meaning how much is growing in, or coming out, of a given tract of forest.

Recently, Kespry appointed a new CEO, enterprise software veteran George Mathew, formerly the president and COO of Alteryx. It also released the Kespry Drone 2, which can take off, fly a mission along a designated path and land without needing human operators at the controls every minute.
The Kespry Drone 2 has one-dimensional, forward-facing lidar sensors that help the flying robots avoid obstacles like trees, cell towers or other structures. That could come in handy around ever-changing construction sites, and forests where trees fall unexpectedly. The company’s latest drone also uses precision GPS to create three-dimensional models of everything below. The models are accurate within centimeters, which could help architects and construction businesses gauge progress or issues on various jobs.
Mathew said, “Kespry from the get-go had the idea to make a complete, turnkey intelligence platform to really serve a specific set of users. The first use case was in mining and aggregates where we have acquired over 100 customers last year. Now we are simply expanding where we see demand.” Mathew views drones as “the new sensor network,” and believes this technology will completely transform heavy industries over the next decade.

146,Farmer’s Business Network cultivates $40 million to help farmers buy seeds at favorable prices,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/07/farmers-business-network-cultivates-40-million-to-help-farmers-buy-seeds-at-favorable-prices/,2017/03/07,"
GV (formerly known as Google Ventures) and DBL Partners co-led a $40 million investment in Farmer’s Business Network, Inc., the company announced on Tuesday. FBN started as something of a professional network for farmers and other agronomists. It allowed people working in agriculture to anonymously share information about what they were paying for seeds, fertilizers and other “inputs” that they need to raise healthy crops. It also allowed them to exchange information about the effectiveness of all of these products.
Bringing crowdsourced, price transparency and product information to the industry would help farmers negotiate for fair prices, FBN founder Amol Deshpande believed. The company claims to be saving farmers up to 50 percent on all the inputs they buy through the site’s service FBN Direct.
Formerly known as FBN Procurement, FBN Direct allows users to buy 500 different farm chemicals, fertilizers, seeds and seed treatments, at prices they set themselves. They tell FBN what price they are willing to pay, and then the tech startup goes out to attain what they need at that established price. Farmer-members of FBN can opt to pick up their supplies at a nearby warehouse, or have them shipped to their farm.
Along with GV and DBL Partners, investors in FBN’s Series C round of funding included Bow Capital and FBN’s earlier backers, Acre Venture Partners and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (KPCB). Venture capitalists have increasingly plowed funding into agriculture tech deals ever since the sale of Climate Corp. to Monsanto for about $1 billion in 2013. The presence of large, acquisitive companies and the uptake of technology like drones, robotics and sensors by farmers are all driving the investment trend.
The new funding for FBN brings the company’s total capital raised to $88 million. Last summer it announced a $20 million round led by Acre.

147,How Hazel Technologies keeps fresh fruit and vegetables from spoiling,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/06/how-hazel-technologies-keeps-fresh-fruit-and-vegetables-from-spoiling/,2017/03/06,"
Chicago-based Hazel Technologies is on a mission to reduce food waste. The company has developed packaging inserts that, through the magic of basic chemistry, can ward off fungus and mold and slow the spoilage of fruits and vegetables.
How big a problem is food waste? The most recent available reports from the U.S. Department of Agriculture have found that each year we waste more than 25 billion pounds of post-harvest fruits and vegetables domestically, worth some $30 billion in value. That number is staggering, and even more depressing when you consider the 42.2 million people, including 6.4 million children, living without enough to eat in the U.S.
According to Hazel Technology’s CEO Aidan Mouat, the company’s BerryBrite and FruitBrite products were developed with farmers and food waste top of mind. They take the form of pads that fit into fruit containers, or sachets about the size of a sugar packet that can be tossed in alongside packed produce. The inserts actively emit ingredients including, respectively, ethylene inhibitors and anti-fungal agents.
Ethylene is a natural plant-ripening hormone. Inhibiting its production keeps produce looking and tasting better for a couple of weeks versus a couple of days. The active ingredient in Hazel Technologies’ FruitBrites packets is more specifically 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), which mimics the effects of ethylene but blocks ethylene receptors in produce. This molecule has been used commercially to keep food and flowers fresh in the past including by companies like AgroFresh and FloraLife.
The biodegradable and non-toxic packaging inserts allow farmers to extend the sale-ability of their fruits and vegetables without having to spray on any chemical solutions, Mouat said. And besides reducing food waste, his startup aims to help farmers sell into new markets. “The geographic range of produce distribution is limited by shelf-life. If I’m a Florida grower of starfruit, it’s hard to sell it in Vancouver. This technology allows me to get it all the way there in shape where customers and consumers will want it,” the CEO said.
In recent weeks, Hazel Technologies raised $800,000 to ramp up manufacturing, while developing new products. Rhapsody Venture Partners led the seed round joined by the donor-advised fund VentureWell and Valley Oak investments. The company, which was started by Northwestern University alumni, previously attained SBIR grant funding via the USDA.
Hazel Technologies’ investor Niko Hrdy, with Valley Oak Investments, said one reason he backed the company was that its products work with farmers’ and shippers’ existing infrastructure. “Their solutions are low cost with substantial, easy-to-measure benefits,” Hrdy said. “Many shippers and growers are already looking for new ways to ship food further, enter new markets, extend the growing season, and have less food rejected at the retail level.”
Given the funding, he expects the company to add employees to its ranks, and begin working with a wider number of growers and shippers around the world, especially throughout the agriculture hubs of the Americas.

148,HowGood raises $4.2 million to guide shoppers to products that match their values,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/02/howgood-raises-4-2-million-to-guide-shoppers-to-products-that-match-their-values/,2017/03/02,"
Millennial consumers care about the sustainability of what they buy more than any other generation that came before them. This point is illustrated in studies from Pew Research, Clemson University and Nielsen, to name a few. Now, a New York-based consumer data company called HowGood has raised $4.2 million in a Series A round of venture funding to help retailers answer every question these discerning customers may have.
HowGood provides ratings on food, personal care items and other household products. The company assesses products for environmental, health and trade impacts. Its ratings appear on signage in stores, and on HowGood’s website and mobile apps. The mobile app allows shoppers to scan the barcode of a given item to obtain its rating.
So far, HowGood has analyzed 200,000 products, mostly food and beverages. It amasses and crunches data from its own proprietary sources, and from a huge range of open government and third-party firms to derive a complete score for different products. Its analysis encompasses everything from ingredient sourcing to chemicals and processing, packaging, shipping and labor practices.
A HowGood user scans the barcode on a yogurt to learn its sustainability rating.
Customers license HowGood’s data and can display scores in their stores if they choose. Some groceries license the data and use it privately to assess their merchandise and make decisions about what they will and won’t continue to stock. Brands may also license the data to see how they stack up against the industry overall from a sustainability perspective.
Alexander Gillett, CEO and co-founder of HowGood, said while only 5 percent of products can attain the top score, many have improved over the years since the company first started as a bootstrapped small business in 2007, an indication that sustainability is actually driving sales for consumer brands. “White label brands often do well, which may surprise consumers,” he added. “It’s no longer true that the more sustainable choice will be prohibitively expensive for someone with a constrained budget.”
HowGood’s Series A round was led by FirstMark Capital and joined by Contour Ventures, the labor rights advocacy foundation Humanity United, Serious Change LP, Great Oaks Venture Capital, High Line Venture Partners and individual angels Jake Lodwick and Joanne R. Wilson.
Rick Heitzmann, founder and managing director of FirstMark Capital, said his firm backed HowGood because ratings are driving a huge lift in sales for certain brands and groceries, while making consumers happier about their choices. He doesn’t expect the trend to wane.

“Consumers have a blindness to different issues. Au naturel, healthy, fat-free… They see all these confusing labels and say ‘screw it, I’m just buying the cheapest thing.’ But if you say hey, this is the best thing for you to buy based on qualities you care about, then they will buy it and be happier with what they bought,” the investor said.
Besides guiding consumers, he said, HowGood gives brands and groceries a far clearer understanding of how sustainable their products really are, compared to the industry, and how that correlates to sales.
HowGood CEO Gillett said the company plans to use its new funding to cover an even wider range of products, and work with a greater number of retailers and grocers. Cosmetics and grooming ratings are under way. While he did not yet have permission to name the companies that plan to use its ratings, he said HowGood struck an agreement with at least one major beauty retailer already.
Some of the funding will also go to technical research and development. HowGood is always looking for new ways to deliver its data to shoppers, whether through wearables and health apps, or new in-store displays and voice-enabled platforms like Google Home or the Amazon Echo.

Campbell, Calif.-based ChargePoint secured a new $82 million funding round, led by automaker Daimler. The new funding will help ChargePoint expand its network of electric vehicle charging stations in Europe, as the company pursues its goal of making charging stations for EVs as readily available and convenient as gas stations.
The funding round also includes existing investors BMW i Ventures, Lines Capital, Rho Capital and Braemar Energy Ventures. But having Daimler join brings a new board member from the automaker, Axel Harries, who previously served on Daimler’s commercial vehicles business, and who now works on its connected, electric mobility services strategy. That makes this investor, and this new senior board resource, very strategic as far as partnerships go.
ChargePoint has already had good success at home in North America, with more than 33,000 charging ports across its various stations and installations. It’s a big provider of corporate charging spots, too — the kind you see in parking lots for large tech companies in the Valley, for instance — with 6,500 corporate customers in total.
Daimler is already partnering with Ford, BMW and Volkswagen Group to build out a fast-charge network for EVs in Europe, and the company is also building out its EQ brand, which is entirely focused on electric mobility.

150,Amazon begins large-scale rooftop solar installation across its warehouses,https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/02/amazon-begins-large-scale-rooftop-solar-installation-across-its-warehouses/,2017/03/02,"
Amazon is looking to improve its renewable energy track record, with a new project that will see it install large solar energy gathering arrays on the rooftops of many of its global fulfillment and sorting facilities. The plan is to start with 15 system installations in the U.S. by the end of this year, with a longer-term plan of putting them on about 50 buildings by 2020.
The initial 15 solar projects will generate a combined output of around 41 megawatts. Individually, one facility’s solar array could provide it with around 80 percent of its energy needs annually, Amazon says, depending on how much sun exposure it receives, what kind of installation Amazon’s able to do, and what operations the facility manages. One concrete example Amazon provides is of its Patterson, CA fulfillment center, where over 75 percent of the building’s 1.1 million square feet of roof will be blanketed in solar panels, which will then help power the hundreds of Amazon sorting robotics within.
Amazon’s green energy initiatives include wind and solar plants across various states that provide power to its AWS data centers, and the company says it has committed to projects which will eventually generate 2.6 million MW of energy from renewable sources in total.

Despite its commitments, Amazon received criticism from environmental watchdog Greenpeace, which said in a report in January that the ecommerce provider still lags behind Apple, Facebook and Google in terms of its renewable energy promises and projects. Solar installations will help defray its use of power from the grid and improve its energy record overall, but Amazon will still need to invest in large-scale dedicated purpose energy generation facilities to address Greenpeace’s larger concerns.

151,Volkswagen’s e-Golf gets a range boost to 125 miles for 2017,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/24/volkswagens-e-golf-gets-a-range-boost-to-125-miles-for-2017/,2017/02/24,"
The e-Golf, Volkswagen’s electric version of its popular compact car, officially gets around 50 percent more range this year than it did in the previous model. That means it now has an EPA rating of 125 miles on a single charge (via Autoblog), compared to 83 miles before. The 125-mile range is still a far cry from the Chevy Bolt’s industry-leading EV range, but the e-Golf is not a vehicle designed for purely electric drivetrains, and it’s also a big enough boost that you can add a few more errands to your daily chore list.
The VW boost is similar to other range additions made by EV makers who are looking to get the most out of advancements in battery tech without completely going back to the drawing board to revamp their car designs. It may not seem like much, but breaking that 100-mile barrier is likely a good way to convince a new category of buyer that they can indeed manage all the driving they need to do on a regular basis without having to stop mid-day to recharge.
Range anxiety is real, and a boost of around 40 miles should actually open up a whole new group of potential customers, alongside other factors that could help drive more EV sales, like increasing familiarity and comfort with the technology among average car buyers.

152,Thistle launches meal kits to make nutritious baby food at home,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/23/thistle-launches-meal-kits-to-make-nutritious-baby-food-at-home/,2017/02/23,"
Food delivery startup Thistle was never in the business of making meal kits, those boxes of pre-measured ingredients and recipes to help customers cook at home. The startup’s married cofounders, Ashwin Cheriyan and Shiri Avnery, thought that prepared meals, ready-to-heat or raw and ready-to-eat, were a better fit for their busy customers. Meal kits, they said, felt like time consuming and frustrating cooking lessons when they tried them personally.
But the startup has made an exception and is launching Thistle Baby meal kits for busy parents who want to make nutritious foods for their babies and toddlers at home. Avnery said, “When I became a mom, I would buy things at the grocery and feel like they were not up to my quality standards all the time. Even a lot of the healthier options are over-processed, pureed, with a watery consistency. They also don’t taste like real fruits or veggies. And you’re left wondering how long this has been on the shelf and in what kind of conditions.”
Thistle Baby sends recipes and pouches of organic ingredients to parents to make baby food at home.
Thistle Baby was designed to give parents the health and taste benefits of homemade, organic and gluten-free baby food, as well as the feeling of pride that comes from making meals for their little ones. Cheriyan said, “We think this takes 80% of the hassle out of making the food at home. And because you steam, puree and add spices on your own, you start to really learn your baby’s preferences, while instilling healthy eating habits as early as possible.” Thistle specializes in plant-based ingredients. Its service has always been vegan and vegetarian-friendly, though they offer omnivore meals, too.
The Thistle Baby meal kit consists of vacuum-sealed bags of apportioned, organic ingredients, flash-frozen to preserve flavor. A parent would open up the pouch, and steam and puree it however they like, then add spices also provided in the meal kit at levels they or their kids like best. The company says its prices work out to $2 per toddler or infant meal. Before now, the startup was trialing its Thistle Baby service with an invitation-only group of subscribers. As of next week, Thistle Baby will become available to any customers who sign up for it.
Thistle co-founders Ashwin Cheriyan and Shiri Avnery with their child.
The startup sees its main competition as baby foods sold in boxes, pouches, and jars by groceries. However, a few other e-commerce food businesses deliver kid-friendly meals or meal kits to families’ doors, too. For example, Lily & Bella in Dallas delivers organic ingredients and recipes to make baby food at home; Los Angeles-based Caer offers low-sugar organic, prepared baby foods for delivery; and NurtureLife in Chicago offers ready-to-eat meals tailored to kids’ developmental stage and food preferences.
According to a recent Nielsen survey, globally 14% of consumers are already buying groceries and household goods online and via mobile. A full 30% of customers said they would be willing to do so. It remains to be seen what portion of the massive baby foods and formula market may shift to e-commerce models like Thistle’s. Nielsen estimates that market generates over $30 billion in annual sales today.

153,Tech War: Prius Prime vs. Hyundai Ioniq,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/20/tech-war-prius-prime-vs-hyundai-ioniq/,2017/02/20,"
By a lucky coincidence, I had a chance to drive both the 2017 Prius Prime and the 2017 Hyundai Ioniq in the same week. The Prius Prime is a plug-in hybrid with a futuristic vibe; the Hyundai Ioniq comes in hybrid, plug-in hybrid and electric versions.
The Prius lineup and the Ioniq lineup are competing for the same buyers, so there will be plenty of comparisons in the automotive press. But this is TechCrunch, so let’s take a look at the technology in each.
Instrument cluster
The first thing anyone is going to look at as soon as they slide into the driver’s seat is the dashboard. The Hyundai Ioniq puts everything where you expect it to be, with a TFT LCD cluster right in front of you. Controls on the steering wheel allow you to choose which information (besides the basics like speed and fuel level) is displayed.
If you’ve never been in a Prius, you might be surprised to have to look a bit to the right to see your instrument cluster. It’s in the center of the dashboard under a curved plastic cowl. There’s loads of information over there, and you can select what’s displayed. It looks, cool but requires you to glance sideways while you’re driving. The Prius Prime I tested had a heads-up display that I found very useful for just this reason.
Infotainment
The Ioniq hybrid I test drove had a clean, basic center console with an 8-inch touch screen with navigation included as part of the Ultimate package. Standard equipment included Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, plus Hyundai’s Blue Link telematics system. (I also drove the EV version, which had a nearly identical infotainment system.)
The Prime Advanced that I tested, which is the top of the Prime line, had a massive 11.6-inch display, but no integration for Apple or Android phones. It was compatible with Siri Eyes-Free and had Toyota’s Entune App Suite, which includes Pandora, iHeartRadio, OpenTable, traffic and weather.
Safety
The Prius Prime comes with Toyota Safety Sense, which is standard on most of its new cars. It includes pedestrian detection, lane departure alert with steering assist and radar cruise control. These aren’t standard features for the Ioniq, but the Ultimate package I tested did have similar safety tech. Both vehicles come with a rear-view camera, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alerts.
Connectivity
The Prius Prime Advanced adds Prime Apps that can be used to manage your charging status from your phone, find a charging station, warm or cool the interior while it’s still plugged in to preserve range and find your vehicle when you’ve forgotten where you parked it.
Hyundai takes that further by connecting the Ioniq to everything it can. Blue Link does all that Prime Apps do, plus integrates with Amazon Alexa (and soon Google Assistant), Apple Watch and Android Wear watches. And it has roadside assistance and stolen vehicle recovery.
Which vehicle has the best tech depends on what you want your vehicle to do. If the idea of Alexa monitoring your every move gives you the creeps, maybe the super-connected Ioniq is too much. But if you have to have Android Auto, the Prius Prime won’t have it. If you like quirky, the Prius Prime exudes quirky. If you want a low-key commuter car, the Ioniq blends in on the highway.
And if you absolutely must have wireless charging for your phone, your decision just got harder. Both the Prius Prime and the Hyundai Ioniq have it available.

154,Ornithologists are using drones to eavesdrop on songbirds,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/18/ornithologists-are-using-drones-to-eavesdrop-on-songbirds/,2017/02/18,"
When conservationists put drones to work in field research, they typically function as flying eyes that gather imagery of the habitat and wildlife below. Now, ornithologists from Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania are using drones as flying ears to monitor songbirds in the Appalachian Mountains.
Results of their drone study were published in the peer-reviewed journal The Auk: Ornithological Advances this week. The study concluded that data gathered by drones was about as effective as data gathered by human experts on the ground in deriving an accurate population estimate of songbirds. The full study, “The feasibility of counting songbirds using unmanned aerial vehicles,” was authored by Gettysburg College environmental studies professor Andy Wilson with two undergraduate students in his lab, Janine Barr and Megan Zagorski. 
A male Cerulean Warbler.
Wilson said he had the idea to use drones to listen to songbirds when he was studying Cerulean Warblers in the area just a few seasons earlier. “It was a hilly area and we were doing surveys mostly from ridge tops. I knew we got a great sample of that habitat, but we were missing steep slopes to either side of us,” the scientist said.
It’s not just steep hillsides but muddy marshes, icy conditions and man-made obstacles from highways to dams, that can block scientists from all the places they’d like to study wildlife. In ornithology, Wilson said, “Sometimes traversing terrain can disturb the birds and stop them from singing.”
Birds sing to mark their territory and attract mates. Constant singing burns a lot of energy. If a bird senses that its songs won’t be heard, due to noise from human activity especially, they may stop singing to save energy. A lack of birdsongs, as the book Silent Spring by Rachel Carson portrays, can indicate burgeoning environmental problems that can have dire consequences to human life, too.
Wilson’s team tied audio recorders to drones with a fishing line 8 meters long to eavesdrop on birds. The lines were long enough that the microphones wouldn’t pick up noise from the drones themselves. The set up also allowed drones to hover at a reasonable distance from the birds they set out to observe. Rather than flying for miles, the drones hovered to act like a human ornithologist conducting what’s called a point count. In a point count, an observer jots down a note about all the birds they can see and hear from a certain location for a set period of time.
The Gettysburg College researchers used DJI’s Matrice 100 quadcopter drones to conduct their study. Research-grade drones used by the likes of large agricultural businesses would have been nice, Wilson said, but aren’t particularly affordable for academic purposes.

While population estimates derived from drone-recorded birdsongs were generally of the same high quality as estimates made with data gathered by ornithologists on the ground, there were a few exceptions. Unmanned aerial vehicles didn’t pick up lower frequency birdsongs like those of the Mourning Dove. And it was hard to suss out a count of Gray Catbirds, because of the high density of their calls. But audio data from drones worked to count other species typical to the Appalachians.
Wilson tells TechCrunch his lab will continue to explore the feasibility of drones to study bird populations. He is planning new studies to evaluate whether or not, and at what point, drones may effect bird behavior. For example, do birds react to drones flown at 50, 60 or more meters away? And how do they change their behavior, if yes? He also wants to compare the quality of birdsong data gathered by recorders on the ground, to that of drones.
Wilson said environmental scientists generally would like to use drones in their studies, but two things are needed to embrace them more commonly. Even top of the line quadcopters only fly for about 22 minutes in clear conditions per battery, Wilson said. And they’re still loud enough that scientists are concerned about disturbing wildlife. “It’s not just the scientific community that would want this. I think there’s a general market for quieter drones,” he said.
Indeed, nobody wants a whining or roaring robot flying overhead.

155,TesLab is the companion app Tesla owners have been waiting for,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/17/teslab-is-the-companion-app-tesla-owners-have-been-waiting-for/,2017/02/17,"
Tesla actually makes a lot of data available to vehicle owners via APIs and other endpoints, but it’s not always easy to find and make use of that info. Enter TesLab, a new app that tracks data and links it to your profile, while also letting you share it out to a community of other Tesla owners in a way that, during the beta spotted by Teslarati, users have really enjoyed.
The app doesn’t require much on the user’s end. Basically you install it on your mobile device, connect your car and create an account (Facebook and Twitter login required for now, though that’s changing soon with original account creation directly in the app). It then monitors your trips, looking at factors including average speed, starts and stops, braking and more. Based on that info, it’ll tell you your overall efficiency (as a percentage of the total ideal mileage rating for the vehicle).
You can see this info as a color-coded heat map on a literal map, showing you where exactly you dipped below max efficiency and where you performed best. The app displays a total efficiency percentage for the trip, too, as well as total time driving, actual miles driven versus charge depleted as represented in miles and the average temperature — along with that most celebrated of EV stats, gas money saved.
“We both drive Teslas and we’re both really passionate about alternative energy, let’s dig into the technology behind Tesla and let’s see how far they’ll let us go, not being employed by Tesla,” said TesLab co-creator and HappyFunCorp co-founder Ben Schippers in an interview, explaining how he and partner Will Schenk came up with the app. “We also saw an opportunity because you buy this really nice car, and then you have this app and the car is super connected, but the app is not super exciting.”
“We thought, what if we could build a framework for what the connected car could be,” Schippers continues. “What if Tesla gave us enough access to our individual cars that we could build a community around what we envision the connected car of the future could be, across all connected cars?”
TesLab is the result of that experiment, and it does pull a lot of data from your vehicle, and attempts to answer that infinitely debated question among EV owners: How much range am I actually getting, as compared to the EPA rating, and why am I seeing the range I’m seeing? It can even provide data on a phenomenon known in the community as “phantom drain,” which is how much range your vehicle loses just from sitting idle between charges, which is hugely dependent on outdoor temp, among other factors.
Schippers and Schenk made a bet that Tesla owners would be willing to share a lot of information regarding their trips and their vehicles, including specific location data, in exchange for that kind of return info and an active community. It’s essentially the same bet Mark Zuckerberg made with Facebook early on, Schippers tells me, but in the specific realm of Tesla owners instead. But the idea isn’t to keep it limited to the exclusive Tesla driver club forever.
“We believe Chevy, and Ford, and BMW and all the big car manufacturers are going to see this and are going to say ‘we should do that, this is the connected framework people are going to want when they buy these cars,'” Schippers said. They key to driving appeal among other makers of EVs will be showing the momentum they’ve already captured with the Tesla community, and growing that with Tesla’s forthcoming entry into the mass market will be a key step toward that goal.

“We already have a huge percentage of the Model X and Model S owners on the beta, and now we need to really focus on getting to the Model 3,” he added. “Once we get to the Model 3, I think it’s game over. Once we get to the Model 3, I think we’ll really be able to show what you can do with a massive amount of data.”
That includes things like crowdsourcing information about Supercharger occupancy, as well as putting a finer point on real-world range that incorporates factors like weather and road conditions, as well as hyper-local gas pricing to show you more exactly how much you’re saving. But it also means extending the app’s current connected controls, which allow remote unlocking and climate settings, to the connected home, too.
“People that drive Teslas, they have a Nest [connected thermostat], so we’ll be able to start doing things from the car to the home,” Schippers explains. “We’ll be able to pre-condition your house, we’ll be able to pre-condition your oven, because we know where you are in space. Once we know where you are in space, then we can connect all the other devices.”

156,Daimler’s Smart will focus on electric vehicles exclusively in North America,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/14/daimlers-smart-will-focus-on-electric-vehicles-exclusively-in-north-america/,2017/02/14,"
The adorable little Smart cars you see on North American roads from here on out will likely be primarily electric, as the company has decided to cease sales of its gas-powered Fortwo and Fortwo Cabrio in the U.S. and Canada from 2017 on.
It sounds like the decision has less to do with overwhelming demand for electric Smart cars, however, and more to do with the North American market’s tremendous preference for crossovers, SUVs and larger vehicles, all of which remained resilient categories in a year that was challenging for consumer car sales for many manfacturers. The micro segment, where the Fortwo remains one of only a few options, did not fare well in 2016, with Fortwo selling only just over 6,000 units in total for the year, as Roadshow notes.
The EV versions of the cars didn’t make up a huge percentage of those sales, either, according to Automotive News, comprising only 25 percent of sales in 2014. But the EV strategy with Smart is more about maintaining a foothold in what could become the next big market – and restricting options could drive more customers interested in the Smart lineup to begin with to go for the zero emission options that remain.
As a city runabout and second car, Smart’s Fortwo with an electric powertrain make a ton of sense, with an estimated range of 76 miles in regular city driving conditions. Still, this could also just be the first step in a general end of the line move for Smart in North America, especially if buyer habits continue to trend towards crossovers and trucks.

Lucid’s Air is a 1,000 HP electric dream car, which is still in the early stages of real-world testing, but which already has more than a few EV fans excited. Now, the company is showing off its winter conditions testing, courtesy of a video shot in Minnesota that makes the state far more appealing than any tourism bureau marketing I’ve ever seen.
The video includes footage shot during the Lucid team’s testing, which was designed to help it prove out its computer-based simulations in actual snow, ice and mixed road conditions. The temperatures during these drives reached lows of -18F, which is cold even by my subarctic Canadian standards.
As anyone who does a lot of snow driving can tell you, all we do is try to achieve maximum, Fast and Furious-style drift arcs, all the time – whether we’re out for a quick trip to grab some groceries, or just doing our daily commute.
No but really this looks super fun, and yet also under control (at the hands of experts, of course), which is right in keeping with Lucid’s pitch that the Air will be a vehicle built for drivers. The Air is still aiming for 2018 for a production time frame, and should hit around the $100,000 mark for pricing, in case you want to start saving those pennies for this winter warrior.

159,Tesla answers claims of poor factory working conditions and unionization efforts,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/09/tesla-answers-claims-of-poor-factory-working-conditions-and-unionization-efforts/,2017/02/09,"
Jose Moran, who claims to be a Tesla employee working at the company’s Fremont, California assembly facility, took to Medium on Thursday to detail working conditions at the company, and to detail efforts on behalf of factory employees to unionize, an initiative in the beginning stages of being supported by the United Autoworkers Union, the U.S. automotive industry’s largest labor union.
In his post, Moran claims that Tesla factory employees earn less than the national average for auto workers, despite residing in the Bay area, where the cost of living is much higher than where most car factories reside. Moran says in the post that Tesla has begun to respond to worker concerns, with a base pay raise in November, yet it also has taken steps that seem to run counter to employee organization, including asking workers to sign a new confidentiality policy.
Moran also makes an appeal to Tesla management’s desire for more smoothly run production operations, likely an attempt to get through to the company as it gears up for Model 3 production and will need to focus on maximizing efficiency.
A Tesla spokesperson provided the following response to Moran’s post:
As California’s largest manufacturing employer and a company that has created thousands of quality jobs here in the Bay Area, this is not the first time we have been the target of a professional union organizing effort such as this. The safety and job satisfaction of our employees here at Tesla has always been extremely important to us. We have a long history of engaging directly with our employees on the issues that matter to them, and we will continue to do so because it’s the right thing to do.
Gizmodo also received direct comments from Elon Musk via Twitter DM regarding the Medium post and Tesla’s treatment of its employees. Musk countered each of Moran’s claims to Gizmodo, saying that mandatory overtime is occasionally required but that its use is dropping weekly, and noting that starting wages are higher than those offered to UAW employees, with total compensation also exceeding equivalent UAW wages when you factor in stock grants.
Musk doesn’t claim to be anti-union in the exchange with Gizmodo, referring instead to his company as “union neutral,” and he characterizes the Medium post an “attack” that’s “morally outrageous” and potentially funded by UAW sources in order to further its agenda of creating a union at Tesla.

160,Tesla said to be aiming to start test production of Model 3 on February 20,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/09/tesla-said-to-be-aiming-to-start-test-production-of-model-3-on-february-20/,2017/02/09,"
Tesla is pausing production at its California assembly plant in Fremont in order to prepare for Model 3 production, the company announced on Wednesday, and Reuters reports via separate sources that it will look to start test production of its Model 3 on February 20, ahead of planned wide-scale production beginning sometime later this year.
The Model 3 is Tesla’s more affordable all-electric vehicle, which has seen over 373,000 pre-orders and which will offer a range of at least 215 miles with pricing starting at $35,000 U.S. before government tax incentives. The vehicle will test the limits of Tesla’s production capability, since the company’s CEO Elon Musk has said they’re targeting production volume of 500,000 cars per year by 2018, in response to strong demand for the Model 3. Tesla is currently making around 100,000 vehicles per year, based on its production total for the final quarter of 2016.
Test production of the vehicle could help the company finalize design details, a process which sources told Reuters is still underway. The stated production start date target for the Model 3 is July 2017, a date considered very ambitious given internal progress, according to Reuters’ sources. Musk himself has also noted these dates may change depending on supplier ability to meet Tesla’s requirements.
Tesla faces more pressure than ever regarding getting Model 3 production underway, since Chevrolet has made good on its promise to produce and begin sales of its own Bolt EV with a 200+ mile range and price tag under $30,000 once you bake in green car incentives. The company also has a lot to prove in terms of investors, so any signal it can provide that it’s on its way to production at scale will be welcome.

161,Ford plug-in hybrid sales rose 38% in 2016,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/08/ford-plug-in-hybrid-sales-rose-38-in-2016/,2017/02/08,"
Ford saw some significant year-over-year growth in its plug-in hybrid sales in 2016, despite gas prices that on average saw historic lows throughout the year. The total number of hybrids sold by Ford numbered 23,895 – which doesn’t seem like a lot, but in relative terms it’s a large jump, and Ford’s hybrid lineup is still relatively modest and focused on only a few market segments for now, while the company has big plans to expand its offerings by 2020.
Ford’s current lineup includes the Fusion Hybrid, C-MAX Hybrid, C-MAX Energy and Focus Electric, as well as the Fusion Energy, which saw its highest ever growth in sales during 2016 with a 63 percent increase over its sales in 2015, helping drive Ford to its record 18 percent ownership of the total electrified vehicle market during the most recent sales year.
Not surprisingly, the coasts are hot spots for sales of Ford’s hybrid lineup, including the Energi, which saw sales double in the New York area, and continues to see strong sales in both LA and California. Ford’s also emphasizing that this uptick in sales is especially noteworthy not just because consumers have typically shown decreased interested in electrified vehicles when fuel prices go down, but also because car sales overall saw a big dip in the year vs. SUV and crossovers, which are seeing significant growth.
All of which suggests Ford will remain committed to its goal of offering a range of 13 electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles by 2020, including a fully electric SUV with a max range of at least 300 miles per EPA rating standards. The category may still be very young, and small in relative terms to overall vehicle sales, but growth like this bodes well for long-term trends.

162,Faraday Future said to be scaling back its electric car model lineup,https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/02/faraday-future-said-to-be-scaling-back-its-electric-car-model-lineup/,2017/02/02,"
Faraday Future is scaling back some of its ambitions, according to Reuters, taking its planed product portfolio from seven electric vehicles to just two, and also reducing the size of its planned assembly factory in Nevada. The factory size reduction was confirmed by a North Las Vegas city manager, and will see the facility occupy less than a third of its original planned footprint.
The report says that Faraday still intends to create a larger facility, but that it will do so later instead of initially, and it has no specific timetable to share in terms of achieving the expansion. The company said it would be building its first assembly facility in Nevada, targeting a yearly output of 150,000 vehicles, back in 2015, and it committed to an investment of over $1 billion in the facility – a commitment which the company told Reuters it still intends to honor. The changed plans will see a capacity of only 10,000 cars per year, at the facility which will open in 2019 instead.
Interestingly, the report also gave us a closer look at what Faraday might be planning beyond its FF 91, the vehicle it unveiled at CES which aims at the high-end luxury segment, and sounds like it could have a price tag of almost $300,000 when it’s released. Reuters says an “FF 81” is planned, too, and is the other vehicle that survived the rethinking of its planned product pipeline. This would be a more affordable crossover vehicle, which would compete directly with the Model X, according to the report.
Faraday faces issues include work stoppages on the facility and a lawsuit from a graphics company due to non-payment of contractors, so it’s understandable to see it scale back its plans. The company’s future is still very much in doubt, but perhaps some of these setbacks will have it avoid making over-bold and splashy statements about its glorious future, which increasingly seem hard to back up.

163,Chevrolet ends production of the Spark EV now that the Bolt EV is out,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/31/chevrolet-ends-production-of-the-spark-ev-now-that-the-bolt-ev-is-out/,2017/01/31,"
Chevrolet is putting its electrified bets on the Bolt EV, as the company announced today that it’s ending production of the Spark EV, the compact car with a relatively meager 82 miles of electric range. The decision to end production of the car likely has a lot to do with the Bolt EV’s much more attractive options, which include 238 miles of EPA rated range.
The price delta between the two cars likely would’ve made it hard for anyone interested in an electric vehicle to opt for the Spark EV, too – it started at just under $26,000, while the Bolt retails for $37,496 MSRP in the U.S., before the federal tax credit of $7,500 cuts that down to much closer. The Spark EV was only sold in three states, and Chevrolet told Detroit News that it sold only around 7,400 of them in total since its introduction in 2013.
Chevrolet’s Bolt EV is a much bigger bet on electric cars, but the company’s decision to part ways with the Spark EV shows it’s not interested in keeping EVs around just for the sake of having some in the lineup. Watching Bolt’s performance will be big not only for the future of Chevrolet’s electric car program, but for those of all automakers, since all eyes are on Chevrolet’s first attempt at a long-range, affordable consumer electric mass market vehicle.

164,GM and Honda partner to mass produce hydrogen fuel cells in Michigan,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/30/gm-and-honda-partner-to-mass-produce-hydrogen-fuel-cells-in-michigan/,2017/01/30,"
Automakers GM and Honda are teaming up on a new venture to jointly manufacture hydrogen fuel cells at scale, with plans to start mass production by 2020 and a combined investment of $85 million split evenly between the two companies dedicated to the effort. Both GM and Honda intend to use the resulting hydrogen fuel cell system in future products, according to the companies.
The joint venture, which will be called Fuel Cell System Manufacturing, LLC, will build the fuel cells at GM’s existing Brownstown, Michigan-based battery pack construction facility, where it currently assembles battery packs for its Volt and Bolt EVs.
GM has been working on hydrogen fuel cell technology for quite some time across a number of industries. It’s working with the U.S. Navy on a fuel-cell powered submarine drone, for instance, and it’s also been developing a Colorado ZH2 test truck for the U.S. Army with a fuel cell powertrain that has a lot of flexibility when it comes to mission-based use.
Overall, the company has invested around $3 billion in development of fuel-cell tech, and is looking to field a fuel cell vehicle for consumers as soon as 2020. GM announced a partnership with Honda to develop production fuel cell technology back in 2013, and their timelines were remarkably similar to the one announced today. The companies also revealed their new, much smaller and more compact fuel cell design.
Dan Nicholson, VP of Global Propulsion Systems at General Motors said at a press conference announcing the joint venture that “we can safely say that today’s announcement officially marks the arrival of fuel cells.”

Honda has a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle available already, in the FCX Clarity. The sedan will be joined by two other models, a fully electric and a plug-in hybrid, later this year.
By combining their efforts, Honda and GM are hoping to help drive manufacturing costs lower, faster. Demand for fuel cell systems across both automakers will help boost scale, and since the two are collaborating on sourcing, they’ll be able to achieve better prices for components from suppliers, too.
Fuel cell technology has significant advantages in terms of range and efficiency vs. both traditional fossil fuel vehicles and purely electric options, with advantages when it comes to refuelling times vs. electric charge.

165,EPA scientific studies must be vetted by administration before release,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/25/epa-scientific-studies-must-be-vetted-by-administration-before-release/,2017/01/25,"
The Trump administration has told the EPA that its scientific work must pass through a political vetting process before being released, multiple sources indicate. I’ve asked the EPA for confirmation on their side of this policy, but Doug Erickson, head of Trump’s EPA transition team, has made it clear to NPR and the AP, among others, that “We’re taking a look at everything on a case-by-case basis, including the web page and whether climate stuff will be taken down.”
This would be in direct contradiction with the EPA’s own “scientific integrity policy,” (PDF) put in place in 2012, which says:

To operate an effective science and regulatory agency like the EPA, it is also essential that political or other officials not suppress or alter scientific findings.
[The policy] Prohibits managers and other Agency leadership from intimidating or coercing scientists to alter scientific data, findings, or professional opinions or inappropriately influencing scientific advisory boards. In addition, policy makers shall not knowingly misrepresent, exaggerate, or downplay areas of scientific uncertainty associated with policy decisions.

This policy could, of course, simply be abolished.
The EPA and other agencies that conduct research have been restricted in their public communications before: higher-level reports were tampered with during George W. Bush’s presidency, and the Union of Concerned Scientists took issue with Obama-era restrictions on press access to scientists. Scientific studies would have been reviewed by peers.
But the outright requirement that studies and data be approved through a political process has no recent precedent. Erickson did not detail the process by which studies would be vetted, nor whether the process would be a permanent or temporary feature of the administration.
This act bodes ill for scientists at federal agencies and using federal grant money who value the freedom to publish such information locally and abroad via social media, journals, and online outlets. It also suggests that moves over the last week to change or restrict online communications and social media posts by other agencies were not isolated or unrelated actions.

Tesla and SpaceX CEO met with Donald Trump on Monday, and just a day later, he’s expressing optimism about Trump’s choice for Secretary of State, former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson.
On the surface, you’d be forgiven for assuming that Tillerson as Secretary of State would be at odds with Musk’s worldview, given the former’s 40+ years of service at a company that produces fossil fuels as its primary business. But Musk replied to an Economics post outlining reasons Tillerson might not be such a bad choice to lead U.S. foreign policy decision-making under Trump.


@TheEconomist This may sound surprising coming from me, but I agree with The Economist. Rex Tillerson has the potential to be an excellent Sec of State.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 24, 2017



Musk also replied to requests from followers to shed light on why, exactly, he would hold such a counterintuitive opinion regarding Tillerson’s selection. The Tesla founder called Tillerson “exceptionally competent,” referring specifically to his tenure at Exxon, and also praised his understanding of global politics. He added in a separate tweet that he believes Tillerson deserves “the benefit of the doubt” pending actions that would contradict that optimism.


@danahull Rex is an exceptionally competent executive, understands geopolitics and knows how to win for his team. His team is now the USA.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 24, 2017



Tillerson has supported a carbon tax previously in his role leading CEO as the most effective way to control industrial impact on climate change, but his former company is under investigation by the state of New York for potentially misleading the public regarding climate change’s effects. In the end, critics suggest Tillerson’s prior acknowledgement of climate change as a problem and proposed solutions were more about alleviating criticism levied against ExxonMobil, and less about effecting real change.
The proposed Secretary of State, who moved one step closer to becoming confirmed in his role, also has close ties to Russia, including a deal made in 2011 in which he exchanged arctic drilling rights for access to supply from Texas and Gulf of Mexico oil fields, as TIME noted in December.
Musk met with Donald Trump previously at a sit-down with tech industry leaders late last year, and also joined his Strategic and Policy Forum. In a prior Q&A with investors, he noted that Trump’s obvious bullishness on fossil fuels might not necessarily preclude potential upside for the alternative fuels sector.
Because SpaceX and Tesla also house so much of their manufacturing operation in the U.S., Musk also likely has reason to be optimistic given Trump’s vocal promotion of U.S.-based manufacturing and regulatory relaxation for companies that choose to build domestically. Still, it’s incredibly weird and at least a little troubling to see him express positive feelings about a Secretary of State pick whose career history has seemed at odds with the public corporate missions of both Tesla and SolarCity.

168,Here’s how Chevrolet built a practical electric vehicle with the 2017 Bolt EV,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/heres-how-chevrolet-built-a-practical-electric-vehicle-with-the-2017-bolt-ev/,2017/01/24," 



Chevrolet said it was going to bring an affordable, long-range electric vehicle to market – and it did, with the 2017 Bolt EV. I visited Palo Alto to find out more about the Bolt EV, and the tech behind it, speaking to the car’s lead engineers and designers.
The Bolt itself was present, too, of course, an impressive car currently shipping to customers that offers an equally impressive drive (more on that in a forthcoming post). Also strangely present in absentia was Tesla, which is the company that has yet to make good on a similar promise to deliver affordability and range in an EV package.

Chevrolet was quick to point out than in Canada at least, it’s outselling Tesla two to one when it comes to electrified vehicles, before the Volt has even launched. That’s if you count the Volt, Chevy’s hybrid electric with a 53-mile pure electric range and gas-powered extend range of 420 miles total. “We are the leader in the electrification of vehicles,” a spokesperson told a room of journalists at the Bolt first drive event.
The Bolt EV does feel like a vehicle capable of leading the industry; the car’s 238-mile range from its 60 kWh battery is better than the 210 mile EPA rating on Tesla’s 60 kWh Model S (though the 75, 90 and 100 kWh options all offer better estimates than the Bolt), and it costs less than half the price of the lowest-specced Tesla. So how did Chevrolet get here?

The Bolt EV is the product of a lengthy design process that involved Chevrolet rethinking car construction and power supply from the ground up, according to Bolt Vehicle Chief Engineer Mike Lelli. He walked us through the car’s use of materials, which balances structural rigidity where it needs it most, with flexibility and weight savings where it can afford it, to help maximize interior space without compromising on battery mileage.
That battery is also uniquely designed, with continuous rectilinear shape that undergirds the vehicle, making it possible to have a low, flat continues floor throughout the car while distributing battery weight evenly and helping create a low center of gravity.
Lelli says that all the hard word that went into designing the Bolt EV as a vehicle tailor-made for balancing range and comfort has paid off, and the evidence is the shipping car itself, which manages to sneak under the $30,000 threshold in the U.S. with incentives (and only just exceeds $30,000 in my home province of Ontario after credits and incentives).

The motor, too, is an exercise in elegant simplicity. It actually only has one physically engaged “gear,” so to speak: Park. There’s a latch that will ensure it can’t move when in park, but otherwise speed is adjusted by changing the rotational velocity of the axle within the motor.
Here’s the thing: Chevrolet has succeeded at its initial goal, but the Bolt EV is still going to face a big test in terms of its ability to appeal to general consumers. Other automakers will be watching closely to see if the Bolt does well, and that’ll inform their own decisions to pursue a similar path twitch models of their own. GM, too, will likely change its strategy regarding EVs considerably depending on the outcome of the bolt.
Leaving aside the tech within, and the stakes, however, Bolt is also just a fun car to drive: Stay tuned for a deeper drive into how it performs in practice coming up shortly on TechCrunch.

Trump said at the meeting he’ll cut regulations, noting he believes they can cut them “by 75 percent, maybe more” and leading to expedited approvals for new manufacturing facilities, reiterating earlier commitments to do the same, and noting that environmentalism in general is “out of control” in his opinion. These comments were made with FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne in the room, whose company is currently facing both EPA and Department of Justice investigations regarding the carmaker’s alleged use of software to control emissions and skirt established U.S. limitations on the same in production vehicles.
Also present were GM CEO Mary Barra and Ford CEO Mark Fields, making this the first time all three top execs at the so-called Big 3 met with the U.S. President since a meeting with former President Barack Obama in 2011 to discuss a deal that would set a target of doubling fuel efficiency across U.S. vehicles by 2025. Obviously, this meeting had quite a different tenor.

Fields said that “we’re very encouraged by the President and the economic policies that he’s forwarding,” and cited Trump’s decision to pull out of the TPP as a sign of why he’s “optimistic about working with the new administration. ”
“We’re excited about working together with the President and his administration on tax policies, on regulation and on trade to really create a renaissance on American manufacturing,” Field said, when interviewed by reporters following the meeting.
“There’s a huge opportunity, working together with industry and with government that we can improve the environment, improve safety and improve the jobs creation and the competitiveness of manufacturing and we’re looking forward to all the elements that Mark talked about to be able to do that,” added GM CEO Mary Barra.
FCA’s Marchionne responded to a parting question by a reported asking if the execs every felt intimidated by Trump’s aggressive tweets at them regarding keeping manufacturing jobs in the U.S., with a simple “No” delivered with impeccable comic timing. FCA also provided the following statement from Marchionne via email:
I appreciate the President’s focus on making the U.S. a great place to do business. We look forward to working with President Trump and members of Congress to strengthen American manufacturing.
Trump has also reportedly effectively shut down the EPA, putting a pause on all the agency’s activities while his administration reviews its budget, spending and policy initiatives, something which is highly unusual even during a transition of power. He also will sign executive orders to push both the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines forward, both of which have been opposed by environmentalists, but will mean increased access to traditional fuel sources in the U.S.

170,LiquiGlide raises $16 million to get every last drop out of packages or tanks,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/liquiglide-raises-16-million-to-get-every-last-drop-out-of-packages-or-tanks/,2017/01/24,"
If you think it’s frustrating trying to get that last drop of ketchup out of the bottle, or toothpaste out of the tube, imagine having to waste and clean valuable and sticky substances from pipes or tanks in a factory.
A startup called LiquiGlide has raised $16 million in a new round of venture funding to bring its patented slippery coatings to manufacturers around the world. Co-founded by CEO J. David Smith and Chairman of the Board Kripa Varanasi, LiquiGlide is an MIT spinout that made its debut at the school’s business plan competition the MIT 100k in 2012.
Smith explained here’s how the company’s coatings work:
“Think about putting oil in a frying pan. It’s a great lubricant. But oil wears off over time and can get into your food. This is a permanent, liquid impregnated surface. We lay down a textured solid layer, something like a thin sponge, that traps liquid there through strong capillary force. Then, whatever you want to slide on top of that can move around because the liquid is mobile.”
LiquiGlide’s proprietary formula consists of flavorless, odorless and already FDA-approved ingredients, Smith said. The coating does not interfere with recycling. The CEO said, “Eliminating the need to wash out a container improves the chances that someone will recycle it. And clean materials are easier to recycle, so we can improve the sustainability of packaging overall.”
TechCrunch asked Smith if LiquiGlide employees use the coating to make anything for their own fun, like lightning-fast snowboards or a ridiculously effective Slip-N-Slide. The CEO said not yet, but the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup has been inundated with inbound requests from students, inventors and businesses that want to use the coating in a wide range of applications.

Staying focused is a challenge, he admits. But investors expect LiquiGlide to use its funding for hiring as needed, and to focus on “packaging and tanks,” i.e. companies that make consumer packaged goods and packaging, or businesses that make industrial tanks or require their use.
Investors in LiquiGlide’s new round included: Structure Capital, Valia Investments, Struck Capital, Pilot Grove and others who Smith did not have permission to name. The funding brings the company’s total equity raised to $25 million to-date. Its last round of $7 million was led by Roadmap Capital.
Managing Partner at Structure Capital, Jillian Manus, said: “We brand ourselves as the ‘architects of the zero waste economy.’ And LiquiGlide is like a poster child for us in a lot of ways. It represents the entire thesis here because this helps reduce wasted water, solvents, energy, product and packaging.” She said the company is facing a massive, and immediate, global market opportunity with urgent interest from automakers in both the US and China.
While Smith did not have permission to name all of the corporations that are testing or using LiquiGlide’s coatings in their packaging or equipment already, the company previously announced deals to work with Norwegian packaged goods conglomerate Orkla, Elmers the glue makers, and the Pact Group in Australia, a major packaging maker there.

171,Kreisel’s fully electric Mercedes G-Class is the Terminator’s off-road vehicle of choice,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/kreisels-fully-electric-mercedes-g-class-is-the-terminators-off-road-vehicle-of-choice/,2017/01/24,"

Electric vehicles tend to be designed with a certain customer in mind, and typically this imagined buyer is probably bookish, possibly vegan and mostly concerned with getting around in maximum efficiency. Tesla shook up this stereotype a bit with its speedy sports cars, but the new Kreisel customized Mercedes G 350 d with a fully electric drive train adds another dimension to the image of the prospective EV buyer.
The project came together thanks in part to a high-profile design partner and stakeholder: Arnold Schwarzenegger. The actor and former California governor drives a Mercedes G in the U.S., but along with Kreisel, had a desire to create a version of his beloved car that also meshed with his values and priorities when it comes to seeking out renewable energy alternatives wherever possible.
“To me, with the electric version of this fantastic car, a dream has become true”, Schwarzenegger said in a press release revealing the vehicle. “The initial test drive was a real pleasure: The Kreisel is incredibly sporty and perfectly benefits from the advantages e-mobility has to offer. I really look forward to the following test runs and to the gradual further development in California.”

Yes, that’s right: The man who played Harry Tasker is the official test driver for the first converted Mercedes G, and he’s doing to be helping with further design and development happening stateside in partnership with Austria-based Kreisel Electric.
This first prototype was built in just two months, and carries a “realistic” maximum range of 300 kilometres, which is impressive for a vehicle whose frame isn’t designed for maximum EV efficiency. It’s powered by an 80 kWh battery, and the car also claimed a 3 second faster 0 to 60 mph time of around 5.6 seconds, when compared to its gas-guzzling V6 progenitor. It also supports fast charging, recouping 80 percent of its capacity in just 25 minutes.

It’s a very cool retrofit, and hopefully one that willing buyers can eventually pick up as a (likely expensive) aftermarket modification. Kreisel is currently building a factory for large-scale production of its electric battery packs for use by automotive OEMs and other clients, so this is more of a side project. But the Gubernator gets what the Gubernator wants.

If you’re not paying attention to what’s going on in energy, you should. We’ve seen this movie before. Spoiler alert: There’s massive economic opportunity ahead. How massive? Imagine standing in 1992, knowing that Google, Akamai, Netflix, Facebook, Amazon, eBay, BuzzFeed and Uber lay ahead.
This time it’s the “enernet,” not the internet, that will transform our lives. The story is the same, though the players have changed.
Here’s the tee up. Across the country, incumbent network providers operate highly centralized networks in their respective cities. Then, scrappy local outfits start serving the market with innovative, distributed technology. These startups create competition, and a new network emerges atop the legacy network.
That was the backdrop 30 years ago when a little thing called the internet emerged. Startups like CompuServe, AOL, EarthLink, Netcom and a host of other local ISPs kicked off the conversion from analog to digital by offering internet access over existing cable and telco networks.
Today, the actors are SolarCity, Sunrun and a host of others moving us off fossil fuels and into clean energy supported by smart equipment, services and software, offered atop existing utility networks. This time, it’s the enernet.
Enernet. Noun. A dynamic, distributed, redundant and multi-participant energy network built around clean energy generation, storage and delivery and serving as the foundation for smart cities. 
Jigar Shah, founder of SunEdison, seeded the enernet revolution more than a decade ago. He devised a breakthrough financing model that made solar affordable and scalable. He’s the Marc Andreessen of this storyline… seminal, smart and strategic.
Today, watch Elon Musk. He presented new solar roof shingles to the world a few months ago. Solar that’s affordable and attractive. Plus, he’s integrating it into a game-changing home system with storage and EV charging. Think the world’s first iPhone. Musk’s electric car company, Tesla, is poised to be an enernet giant, the Amazon of this go-around — margin-challenged in its early years, but set to move.
Let’s stop acting surprised, and instead start acting.
It goes well beyond Tesla. There is a long list of enernet innovators now emerging. They are building nanogrids, microgrids, distributed energy resources and virtual power plants. They are creating new, intelligent building materials and smart lighting. They are deploying new networks and intelligence that are driving down costs and improving services.
At heart, the enernet is the foundation for smart-city tech, including the “Internet of Things,” distributed systems, interconnected backbones and networking technologies, EV-charging services and autonomous vehicles, to name a few. These technologies will drive dramatic change and force us to rethink our cities, municipal services and sectors like transportation, insurance, real estate and financial services.
From the enernet evolution will come smart cities that are an order-of-magnitude smarter, healthier and safer. The new network will also present quantum leaps in energy security and emergency resilience that can stand in the face of superstorms or cyberattacks.
Hold on to your seats. We’re at the early stages of something immense.
Still, I hear the seeds of fear and doubt. There is an oft-cited refrain that the transition will cost a lot and take a long time. That’s absolutely silly. We don’t look back at the internet transformation from analog to digital and think, “Wow, that was slow and cost a ton of money. We should have stuck with the typewriter and landline.” Fact is, it was blazingly fast and driven by those who understood the spend as leveraged investment, not cost center.
Likewise, the move to clean energy will seem fast and prudent as solar and energy storage continue to scale, smart cities accelerate and prices continue their fall.
I also hear “the utilities are in big trouble.” Let’s not be simplistic. Google didn’t kill Comcast. Comcast is doing just fine. The utilities that own transmission and distribution networks (the wires companies) have enormous value and opportunity ahead. There is no way that the transition happens without the participation of these companies, and there is considerable economic upside ahead for them. Forward-thinking utilities — Consolidated Edison, National Grid and others — see what’s coming and are poised to thrive in the enernet world.

Sure, fossil-fuel generators and suppliers have challenges ahead, just like the content companies were challenged by newer, more flexible, cost-effective content producers. It’ll be up to the management teams at these companies to de-risk the future with intelligent investment and acquisitions. Hats off to folks like David Crane, a visionary who worked to drive that transition at NRG Energy. We will see more of that type of leadership again over the next 10 years as market dynamics shift and outcomes become more obvious and urgent to the incumbents.
That said, enernet innovation, like innovation in every other sector, is unlikely to originate from within the incumbents. If you don’t believe me, read books like The Innovator’s Dilemma by Clayton Christensen or this article from Accenture that asserts “corporate innovation does not work.” Unless a Lou Gerstner or Steve Jobs is at the helm of an incumbent, innovation will be acquired, not grown.
This backdrop presents incredible opportunity for startups and early investors in the space. I’m excited to be part of that, and I hope that talented entrepreneurs turn their attention from the app economy to the enernet. There’s enormous upside.
As I said, we’ve seen this movie. Let’s stop acting surprised, and instead start acting. An economic powerhouse awaits the United States. We’ll be thankful we chose to become a worldwide enernet leader, as this evolution creates a new kind of healthy, robust economy.

173,The official White House website has dropped any mention of climate change,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/20/the-official-white-house-website-has-dropped-any-mention-of-climate-change/,2017/01/20,"Trump’s administration is acting quickly to dangerously reimagine reality. It has deleted all specific mentions of “climate change” and “global warming,” as well as removed an entire page dedicated to the subject at the http://www.whitehouse.gov/energy/climate-change URL, which is no longer an active link.
UPDATE: While it’s typical to archive previous administration pages under new leadership, as Snopes.com points out, the fact remains that the new White House page removes mention of “climate change” and promotes a new energy policy page which specifically states it will pursue the elimination of key environmental policies like the Climate Action Plan.
Motherboard noticed the change when it occurred at noon ET, when the official changeover took place. A screenshot of how it appeared under President Obama is included below for references, and you can view a live version courtesy of the Wayback Machine.

The White House official website also used to list Climate Change as a “Top Issue,” but now the closest equivalent is “American First Energy Plan,” which leads to a statement about Trump’s broad policy goals in terms of U.S. energy policies, focusing on protectionist resource usage measures.
The page also includes this troubling passage, indicating in no uncertain terms Trump’s goals as they pertain to the issue his new administration website won’t even call out by name:
For too long, we’ve been held back by burdensome regulations on our energy industry. President Trump is committed to eliminating harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule. Lifting these restrictions will greatly help American workers, increasing wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years.
As of this writing, the EPA.gov website still lists “Climate Change” as one of its most popular environmental topic pages, so the official government agency overseeing environmental issues at least acknowledges the existence of the world’s most pressing ecological issue. That may change, however. Motherboard reports insiders are skeptical that the EPA’s web presence will survive untouched under the new administration, and the new White House policy overview on energy policies says it will reset the EPA’s focus on protecting clean air and water domestically.
These kinds of dangerous and irresponsible changes to institutional repositories of public knowledge on serious issues agreed upon by the vast majority of credible experts are unlikely to be isolated. They could also have a profound impact on the availability of environmental data, and of course policy changes that follow from these immediate positional shifts are likely to have considerable effect on startups focused on green and clean tech projects.
The official White House page for LGBTQ rights was also removed when the turnover occurred.

174,Ford begins testing Transit Plug-in Hybrids in London ahead of 2019 production,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/20/ford-begins-testing-transit-plug-in-hybrids-in-london-ahead-of-2019-production/,2017/01/20,"
Ford has begun testing of its new Transit Custom Plug-In Hybrid with Transport for London, working with the UK city’s local transit authority to pilot 20 of the new vehicles in use during a 12-month trial with select London businesses for commercial use. The pilot of the vehicles, which feature a pure electric range of around 31 miles according to European agency measurement standards, is designed to pave the way for broad production and sales in Europe beginning in 2019.
The Plug-in Hybrid Vehicle (PHEV) version of the Transit is one of 13 total new electric or hybrid vehicles that Ford will introduce globally over the course of the five years, including a hybrid Mustang, F-150 and other cars to be announced later. The 20 PHEV Transit vehicles in this pilot are expected to be able to cover the majority of their daily use on their electric motors, Ford says, since their internal city routes to deliver goods or answer service calls shouldn’t typically exceed that capacity.
Development of Ford’s test fleet for the London trial is supported by a £4.7 million ($5.8 million U.S.) grant from the UK’s Advanced Propulsion Centre, a government-funded research facility that was created in 2013 in partnership with industry to advance low emission alternatives to fuel-burning engines. London has also committed to creating an “Ultra Low Emission Zone” in the city core by 2020, which will incur a fee on any vehicles that exceed tight carbon output standards.

175,Tesla now offers a 100D Model S and Model X with extended range,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/20/tesla-now-offers-a-100d-model-s-and-model-x-with-extended-range/,2017/01/20,"
Tesla’s new 100 kWh battery pack first arrived with a “performance” designation, hence the “P” in P100D, but now the company has released the 100D version of the upgrade option, which delivered the same capacity, but tweaked for efficiency rather than speed. The 100D option was added early Friday morning, promising an additional 20 miles of range based on EPA standards.
That means the Model S with the 100D battery pack gets 335 miles instead of 315 for the P100D, Electrek notes, and the Model X gets 295 miles instead of 257 miles for the performance option. Both of these options will bump the price of the car by an additional $3,000 vs. the 90D battery pack option, which remains available for purchase.
The boosted range means you’ll be foregoing the possibility of a sub-2.4 second 0 to 60 mph time, and in fact will have to settle for just 4 seconds for that sprint start. If you can live with that still very impressive acceleration, the added range will probably be a more attractive option to most people who aren’t buying a Tesla strictly to drag race.
As with all new Tesla’s coming off the production line since late last year, these new model options will include all the hardware on board to achieve full self-driving capabilities once the software is ready to make that possible, which will probably not be until at least 2018 for a broad public release.

 Kevin Gluba is the executive director of the Alliance for Innovation and Infrastructure.


President-elect Trump has called for a trillion dollars in infrastructure investment, but he wants the private sector to play a critical role. Fortunately, one of our nation’s immediate infrastructure needs will not have to rely on the federal government at all.
Private sector investment in a smarter grid will allow for better integration of distributed energy resources (DER), like rooftop solar, while strengthening reliability and making power systems more resilient. And it can all be done without a dime from Congress.
Regardless of one’s views on rooftop solar or net metering policies, encouraging early investment in infrastructure and technology — based on good planning and forecasting — is the most immediate way to capitalize on the benefits of this growing resource and improve electric reliability simultaneously.
Each power system is unique, meaning the investment needs of a particular system are dependent upon the interaction of multiple variables, including the size of the system, the load profile (e.g. residential, commercial, industrial), generation portfolio, geographic location and the age and “state of infrastructure” of the existing system. With so many variables, even a small number of solar-equipped homes acting as mini power plants can impact the operational integrity of a system, which could put local and even regional reliability at risk absent appropriate planning.
Yet many rooftop proponents suggest that integrating increasing amounts of rooftop solar onto the grid is a relatively simple, straightforward task. Utilities in turn argue for hefty solar surcharges to maintain the reliability and affordability of the system. The truth is somewhere in between, in that rooftop solar can indeed be integrated successfully, cost-effectively and with maintained reliability.
A wait and see approach puts all ratepayers at risk of black-outs, brown-outs or unplanned maintenance issues.
But make no mistake, there is nothing simple or straightforward about converting what was designed decades ago as a unidirectional system into a bidirectional system to allow homes to produce and export power back to the grid.
Consider, for example, your garden-variety garden hose. Turn the spigot and water flows through, courtesy of your local water provider. Now imagine reversing the flow. Pumping water back into a system that wasn’t originally designed to provide a two-way flow is going to have some impact on the existing infrastructure — pipes, pumps, valves and tanks, etc. The same holds true for the electric grid: Reversing the direction of electricity on a system that was designed primarily to deliver power — not absorb it — is having an impact on existing infrastructure — power lines, transformers, substations, control systems, etc.
Another difficulty is that solar power is a variable resource, which makes it unpredictable and difficult to forecast consistently in most regions. Moreover, as with any “behind the meter” resource, the system operator lacks adequate visibility into when, where and how much these resources are producing. With potentially hundreds and thousands of rooftop solar-equipped homes locally — and millions of homes nationally — acting as individual generators, each home becomes a critical but variable and potentially “invisible” component of the grid. Such a combination of intermittency and lack of resource visibility could seriously undermine reliability.

This holds true for the bulk-power system, as well. Any problems at the local distribution level could cascade “upstream” to the bulk power system, putting additional stress on regional grids. At a Reliability Technical Conference hosted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last summer, both the PJM Interconnection and the California Independent System Operator — the grid operators for millions of Americans in the eastern U.S. and California, respectively — stressed the need to improve DER visibility and forecasting, address variability and ramping concerns and enhance communication between system operators and DER resources.
The issues mentioned herein — bidirectional flow, intermittency, visibility and communication — are not insurmountable, and demonstrate exactly why utilities, based on the needs of their respective systems, should be planning for and making appropriate investment decisions now. From upgrading wires and poles to smart power inverters to synchrophasors and sensors to updated communications and data gathering systems to advanced energy analytics software, there are numerous technologies currently available and capable of being deployed that warrant utility consideration.
A wait and see approach puts all ratepayers at risk of black-outs, brown-outs or unplanned maintenance issues, and fails to fully recognize the value of rooftop solar and other promising distributed resources, such as energy storage.
The more sensible approach is to encourage utilities to begin identifying, planning for and making the necessary infrastructure investments to reliably integrate rooftop solar into their systems. Such an approach will identify and resolve reliability issues earlier, ease the rooftop solar transition in the long term and best realize the full reliability and economic and environmental benefits that rooftop solar can offer.

Tesla will be making electric motors and gearboxes at its Nevada Gigafactory, in addition to batteries. The news comes from Nevada governor Brian Sandoval, who discussed that additional manufacturing plans for the Gigafactory during a policy speech on Tuesday.
The Gigafactory, which officially opened for business last year, is a massive facility with a $5 billion price tag, a solar-power generating roof and a final physical footprint of around 5.8 million square feet, with total usable square footage of more than 13 million feet thanks to use of multiple internal floors. It began large scale battery production for use in Tesla’s Powerwall and Powerpack products earlier this year, and will spin up production for Model 3 battery units later in 2017.


Pleased to announce that @TeslaMotors will expand its investment in #NV by producing electric motors & gearboxes at   #Gigafactory #nvsots
— Governor Sandoval (@GovSandoval) January 18, 2017



Expanding production capacity to include electric motors and gearbox components should definitely help Tesla make use of its expanding space at the Nevada facility, and Sandoval says it’ll also result in 550 new jobs at the manufacturing site in his state, Fortune reports. The Gigafactory is only around 30 percent complete right now, with new modules being brought online as they’re completed thanks to its unique design.
Tesla likes to own as much of the vehicle production process as is possible, and especially in the case of core technologies it believes will eventually drive its ability to be cost competitive. It currently builds its electric motors for the Model S and Model X in-house at its Fremont, CA factory, but using the Gigafactory for Model 3 production makes sense, given Tesla has a goal of building 500,000 of the upcoming electric sedan in its first full year of production.

178,Fiat Chrysler under investigation by U.S. Justice Department over emissions,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/13/fiat-chrysler-under-investigation-by-u-s-justice-department-over-emissions/,2017/01/13,"
Thursday we learned that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is investigating Fiat Chrysler U.S. (FCA) regarding alleged software-based circumvention of emissions standards. On Friday, Bloomberg reported that the U.S. Department of Justice is also looking into that same alleged failure of its responsibility to disclose the use of emissions altering software for possible criminal prosecution.
The probe into FCA is similar to the one that Volkswagen encountered in its own emissions scandal, though Bloomberg reports that fewer overall vehicles are involved in the Department of Justice’s inquiry into Fiat Chrysler. It isn’t clear how far along the DoJ’s investigation is at this stage, only that it’s underway.
The DoJ’s criminal investigation into Volkswagen resulted in criminal charges against six high-ranking employees of the automaker, who were indicted on Wednesday. FCA CEO Sergio Machine said during a media call that his company’s issues are “nothing” like the Volkswagen situation, however.
“We are confident that no one at FCA committed any fraud or tried not to be compliant,” Marchionne said, as reported by Bloomberg. “We may be technically deficient but not immoral. We never installed any defeat device.”
FCA released a statement on Thursday saying their emissions management software “meet the applicable requirements” set out by the EPA, and do not constitute “defeat devices” designed to circumvent emissions standards as laid out by the agency.

179,EPA accuses Fiat Chrysler of using software to skirt emissions standards,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/12/epa-accuses-fiat-chrysler-of-using-software-to-skirt-emissions-standards/,2017/01/12,"
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued a notice to Fiat Chrysler (FCA), informing the automaker that approximately 104,000 vehicles, including specific models of 2014, 2015 and 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokees and Dodge Ram 1500 trucks, included “at least eight” pieces of engine management software that helped them “skirt” EPA rules regarding emissions limitations. This software was not disclosed by FCA to the EPA.
The alleged violations run counter to the Clean Air Act, which requires that carmakers show the EPA via certification that their vehicles meet standards set at the national level to help curtail and control air pollution. Part of the Clean Air Act specifies that software included in a vehicle that can affect emissions from the car be fully disclosed and explained as part of the certification process, but FCA did not do that in the case of the named vehicles sold with model years mentioned above.
The EPA says that as a result of its actions, FCA could face “civil penalties and inductive relief.” A new testing process put in place by the EPA in September 2015, which was introduced following discovery of Volkswagen’s notorious EPA emissions standard violations, brought the modification to light, according to the EPA. That means we have to wonder how many more automakers might face similar blowback thanks to the more rigorous screening process.
For its part, FCA US says it’s “disappointed” with the EPA’s choice to issue this notice, saying it’s been working behind the scenes with the EPA for “months” regarding requests to explain its in-vehicle emissions management tech. FCA’s full statement is included below:

FCA US Response to EPA
January 12, 2017 , Auburn Hills, Mich. – FCA US is disappointed that the EPA has chosen to issue a notice of violation with respect to the emissions control technology employed in the company’s 2014-16 model year light duty 3.0-liter diesel engines.
FCA US intends to work with the incoming administration to present its case and resolve this matter fairly and equitably and to assure the EPA and FCA US customers that the company’s diesel-powered vehicles meet all applicable regulatory requirements.
FCA US diesel engines are equipped with state-of-the-art emission control systems hardware, including selective catalytic reduction (SCR). Every auto manufacturer must employ various strategies to control tailpipe emissions in order to balance EPA’s regulatory requirements for low nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and requirements for engine durability and performance, safety and fuel efficiency. FCA US believes that its emission control systems meet the applicable requirements.
FCA US has spent months providing voluminous information in response to requests from EPA and other governmental authorities and has sought to explain its emissions control technology to EPA representatives. FCA US has proposed a number of actions to address EPA’s concerns, including developing extensive software changes to our emissions control strategies that could be implemented in these vehicles immediately to further improve emissions performance.
FCA US looks forward to the opportunity to meet with the EPA’s enforcement division and representatives of the new administration to demonstrate that FCA US’s emissions control strategies are properly justified and thus are not “defeat devices” under applicable regulations and to resolve this matter expeditiously.

Las Vegas, transportation beat reporters can’t quit you; CES was like a car extravaganza, and now you’re launching a self-driving, fully electric shuttle on public streets. The shuttles are the result of a partnership between shuttle-maker Navya, fleet logistics provider Keolis and the city of Las Vegas, and began picking up members of the public today, riding a regular route along iconic Fremont Street between Las Vegas Boulevard and Eighth Street — right in the thick of regular traffic.
The route will run between January 11 and 20, and will use Navya’s ARMA shuttle, which previously underwent testing in the U.S. at the University of Michigan’s MCity autonomous testing facility, and which has been deployed in France since 2015. The test is part of Las Vegas’ broader efforts to create a designated area in the city’s urban center for testing autonomous and connected cars. Vegas has also invested significantly in connected infrastructure, including connecting traffic lights throughout the downtown area.

Shuttles with defined routes are a relatively low-risk area for companies to deploy autonomous-driving tech, as there are fewer variables to take into consideration as compared to more free-roaming self-driving vehicles. You can map the route extensively, for instance, and having connected infrastructure present is also a plus. It’s likely we’ll see much more of this kind of autonomous-tech deployment well before we see self-driving consumer-owned vehicles on roads.

181,FarmLogs raises $22 million to make agriculture a more predictable business,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/11/farmlogs-raises-22-million-to-make-agriculture-a-more-predictable-business/,2017/01/11,"
Ann Arbor, Michigan-based FarmLogs has raised $22 million in a Series C round of funding for technology that helps farmers monitor and measure their crops, predict profits, manage risks from weather and pests and more. Naspers Ventures led the round, joined by the company’s earlier backers Drive Capital, Huron River Ventures, Hyde Park Venture Partners, SV Angel and individual investors including Y Combinator president Sam Altman.
According to CEO and co-founder of FarmLogs Jesse Vollmar, the company has invested heavily in satellite imagery and data since it graduated from the Y Combinator accelerator in 2012. It develops predictive models on top of that raw data to help farmers “program” their fields, Vollmar says.
“We analyze fields all around the U.S. all season long. We can highlight and alert farms when we see a problem developing, and send them out to examine and fix things they never would have caught on the ground. It’s all thanks to a multi-year history of performance satellite imagery,” he explained.
In one recent case, FarmLogs was able to help farmers who knew their neighbors were experiencing grasshopper infestations to pinpoint the bugs in their own massive operation, and stop the pests from spreading. In another typical case, FarmLogs users can see if an irrigation system has stopped working properly and part of their field is over- or under-watered, then go out and fix the system before washing away expensive inputs, like fertilizers or organic pesticides.
Vollmar grew up in a farming community and working for the family business, an organic corn farm. His company has focused on row crops, including corn and soybeans, which make up the bulk of agricultural production in the U.S. Vollmar said farmers like the company’s mobile app and website because it gives them access to data science without having to buy and install a bunch of new high-tech gear in their fields. FarmLogs works with all matter of data gathered from the farm equipment that agronomists do use, however, including tractors and other heavy equipment built by John Deere, Holland, Case Corporation and others.
FarmLogs, which employs about 70 full-time, plans to use the new round of capital for further hiring, and to make its technology known to even more row-crop farmers. With the funding round, Naspers Ventures’ head of U.S. investments, Mike Katz, will join FarmLogs board of directors.
The company’s main competition comes from Monsanto-owned Climate Corp. and its Climate FieldView application.

182,Kuli Kuli raises $4.25 million to make moringa a mainstay in the US diet,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/11/kuli-kuli-raises-4-25-million-to-make-moringa-a-mainstay-in-the-us-diet/,2017/01/11,"
Oakland-based food startup Kuli Kuli has raised $4.25 million in a Series A round of funding to bring moringa, a high-protein plant, to more kitchens in the U.S., according to CEO and co-founder Lisa Curtis.
During her time working in Niger for the Peace Corps, Curtis got a taste for the moringa plant, which grows pervasively in tropical climates and is higher in iron, calcium and protein than other leafy greens, even kale. But on her stateside return, she couldn’t find moringa in groceries. She co-founded the company in 2011 with a dual mission to make moringa popular back home and support women farmers around the world.
Kuli Kuli connects with women who are farmers in West Africa, South America and the Caribbean, purchasing their moringa harvests at a fair price and sometimes providing additional support, through select projects, which help the farmers and their communities plant moringa trees, and learn about nutrition. To date, the company reports that it has supported 800 women farmers and helped to plant 200,000 moringa trees.
The Kellogg Company’s new venture arm, Eighteen94 Capital, led the Series A round in the for-profit for-good startup Kuli Kuli. The fund was joined by food and environment-minded investors S2G Ventures and InvestEco, along with individual angels. The deal represents the first for Kellogg’s new fund, which it formed with Touchdown Ventures in June last year.
Eighteen94 Capital Managing Director Simon Burton said while Kellogg’s doesn’t produce any food items that use moringa as an ingredient, the company will help Kuli Kuli Foods figure out how to navigate through its next stage of growth. He said, “There’s a lot of potential here, whether it’s the nutrition or the super food angle, for moringa and Kuli Kuli to scale. We’re seeing search trends that look like the trend lines around something like quinoa ten years ago.”
Since its earliest days, Kuli Kuli has employed technology in fundraising, debuting its products on Indiegogo, connecting with angel investors through AgFunder and raising a loan through Kiva. The startup also uses proprietary technology in processing the moringa plant, a so-called “superfood,” into bars, powders, tea and energy shots.
It has also run recipe competitions online, including one judged by elite chef José Andrés, to drum up interest in cooking with moringa. Winners got a trip to dine with the chef at his China Chilcano restaurant in Washington, D.C.
Kuli Kuli also has new products in the works for release in 2017, Curtis said. The company will likely sell those direct to consumers online first, before rolling them out nationally to brick and mortar groceries. But funds will mainly be used for getting Kuli Kuli’s moringa products into more customers’ hands.
“Our goal with this capital is to really expand our distribution. We are in 3,000 stores already including lots of natural food stores, Whole Foods and others. But there are more places we’d like to be, including conventional retailers. We have a first to market advantage and the wind is at our backs right now,” the CEO said.

183,"Apple, Facebook and Google top Greenpeace’s clean energy report",https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/10/apple-facebook-and-google-top-greenpeaces-clean-energy-report/,2017/01/10,"
Apple has earned the title of greenest tech company in the world for the third year in a row, according to a new report from environmental organization Greenpeace. In a new report, “Clicking Clean: Who is Winning the Race to Build a Green Internet,” Apple lead the pack with an “A” grade and a clean energy index score of 83 percent.
Facebook and Google also did well, with scores of 67 and 56 percent, respectively, along with data center provider Switch, which scored 100 percent. However, Netflix, Amazon Web Services and Samsung were found to be lagging.
Greenpeace’s clean energy index accounts for how much clean energy the companies use from renewable resources, as well as other factors, such as their willingness to make their energy consumption publicly available, and their commitment to powering their data centers with renewable energy, for example.
Because of these companies’ size, they have the power to influence others in the industry when it comes to the use of clean energy. As the report noted, Apple plays a “catalytic role within its IT supply chain, pushing other IT data centers and cloud operators who help deliver pieces of Apple’s corner of the internet to follow their lead in powering their operations with renewable energy.”

Facebook also received accolades for being the first major internet company to commit to be 100 percent renewably powered, and it continues to play a leadership role in the sector. Its five latest data centers were renewably powered, Greenpeace pointed out.
 
Google, too, has been taking steps toward a renewably powered Google Cloud, and is improving its deployment of renewable energy in new markets, but was dinged for being less transparent than others, including Apple, Facebook and Switch, in terms of providing facility level energy demand data.
The report called out major tech companies Netflix, Amazon, Samsung, and others. It also for the first time analyzed Asian tech giants, like Tencent, Baidu, Alibaba and Naver, which are expanding to become global businesses.
That region is “well behind the U.S. market in renewable commitments,” said Greenpeace, citing fewer clean energy options from monopoly utilities.
This is of particular concern for environmental organization, given these companies’ ongoing growth and expansion.
“We must see East Asian internet companies exhibiting the will to commit to 100 percent renewable energy, particularly as they expand to markets around the world,” said Greenpeace East Asia Senior Climate and Energy Campaigner Jude Lee, in a statement.

“Leading IT companies in the United States have already shown that the majority of the industry recognizes that clean power is both good for the environment and good for business. East Asian companies must step up to embrace that reality as well,” Lee added.
Meanwhile, Netflix, which accounts for one-third of North America’s internet traffic and contributes to data demand worldwide, had announced in 2015 it planned to fully offset its carbon footprint. However, Greenpeace said that it’s likely that it’s turning to carbon offsets or unbundled renewable energy credits, which “do little” in terms of increasing the company’s renewable energy investment.
“Like Apple, Facebook, and Google, Netflix is one of the biggest drivers of the online world and has a critical say in how it is powered. Netflix must embrace the responsibility to make sure its growth is powered by renewables, not fossil fuels and it must show its leadership here,” said Greenpeace USA Senior IT Analyst, Gary Cook, also in a statement.
The company earned “F’s” in energy transparency, renewable energy commitment and advocacy.
Amazon’s overall Clean Energy Index percentage fell from last year, thanks in part to its nearly doubling of its data center capacity in Virginia – a region with little to no renewable energy options, the organization said – which outstripped Amazon’s addition of renewable energy capacity.
Amazon was also awarded an “F” for its energy transparency.
“Amazon continues to talk a good game on renewables but is keeping its customers in the dark on its energy decisions. This is concerning, particularly as Amazon expands into markets served by dirty energy,” said Cook.
However, Greenpeace did give it a nod for its increased clean energy and climate advocacy over the past year. Amazon’s advocacy with both policymakers and utility companies saw it supporting tax credits for clean energy, pushing for repeal of laws that restrict wind development, and negotiating an innovative energy management deal in Virginia, which saw the Dominion Virginia Power agreeing to integrate energy produced by Amazon’s wind and solar farm projects on the grid serving its AWS data centers.
Greenpeace noted that nearly 20 internet companies have now committed to 100 percent renewable energy. But the fight isn’t over, as the sector itself continues to rapidly expand.
“Thanks to the leadership and advocacy of companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, and Switch, we are seeing the tech industry make major strides toward powering the internet with clean energy,” said Cook.
Update, 1/13/17: Following the release of the report, Greenpeace began a social campaign to raise awareness about those companies who received poor grades for their use of non-renewable energy. For example, the organization released the video below which targets Netflix:

184,Next-gen Samsung EV battery gets 300+ miles of range from a 20-minute charge,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/09/next-gen-samsung-ev-battery-gets-300-miles-of-range-from-a-20-minute-charge/,2017/01/09,"
Samsung’s SDI battery subsidiary announced a new battery cell designed for use in electric vehicles that offers improved density to manage a max range of up to 372 miles on a full charge, with a quick charge capacity that will help it regain 310 miles or so of charge on just 20 minutes of charging. Unveiled at the North American International Auto Show for the first time, the new battery tech come with a 10 percent decrease in the number of units and weight required vs. current production battery units made by Samsung SDI.
Mass production isn’t set to begin until 2021, but the tech should arrive in time to supply the first crop of autonomous cars, which are also targeting street dates sometime within that year from a range of manufacturers. EV and self-driving are tied closely to one another, since both are crucial components for operating the kind of on-demand ride-sharing fleets planned by Ford, among others.
A 20-minute charge delivering that kind of range would help considerably with making EVs more practical for more drivers; it’s around the time you’d spend at a rest stop using the restroom and grabbing coffee or a snack, after all. By comparison, Tesla’s superchargers currently manage to provide around 170 miles of range on a half-hour charge, so Samsung’s planned tech could approximately double that.
Tesla’s long-term goal, according to CTO JB Straubel at the time of the Supercharger’s first unveiling, is to get charging times down to between five and 10 minutes, and it has been quietly boosting the maximum theoretical output of the stations themselves (though Tesla vehicle batteries are still limited to 120 kW in terms of how much power input they can accept).
Tesla produces its own batteries in partnership with Panasonic, and just began construction on its latest generation cells at its Gigafactory in Nevada, while Samsung’s new 21700 cylinder cell model is currently being used by “U.S. automobile startups” in their EVs, according to Samsung SDI. One of those startups is Lucid Motors, a new EV company with a lot of Tesla talent on board.

Volkswagen’s new I.D. Buzz electric vehicle concept is a futuristic take on the microbus that revives the family camper for an era when we’ll spent just as much of our time on the road relaxing or hanging out with our fellow passengers as we will driving. The new EV design, Volkswagen’s second concept car in the I.D. line, was revealed at this year’s North American International Auto Show.
The Buzz has a max range of 270 miles on a single charge, and all-wheel drive, with a fully autonomous mode that allows the front seats to be reconfigured to face backwards towards the rear compartment. Depending on what you’re doing with the car, you can seat up to eight using the modular seating arrangement – or just create two luxurious, vehicle length loungers for relaxing while the car drives itself.

The in-car entertainment system is also designed to cater to different passenger arrangements, with a big, removable tablet in the center console and an AR-enabled heads-up display for overlaying information on your view out the windshield. The car remembers who you are using Volkswagen ID, and can set preferences specific to any individual driver. A Beats partnership puts an external speaker with Bluetooth connectivity in-car, which can then be removed for use outside the vehicle – maybe at a camp site, for instance.
Like other autonomous cars, a lot of the communication between vehicle and people takes place via the lighting system, which includes LEDs outside that can communicate things like when autonomous driving is engaged with pedestrians, and ambient mood lighting within.

The microbus was always a car that people loved for its flexibility; it excelled at providing a great getaway vehicle for families with an adventurous spirit. The new I.D. Buzz looks like it has the same DNA, but with an update for a more tech-savvy generation.
Buzz is a concept, so there’s no guarantee we’ll ever see a production vehicle like it on the road, but Volkswagen is committed to hit a sales target of 1 million electric vehicles annually by 2025, with a range of models, so this reimagined microbus could definitely still see the light of day at some point.

186,Better Ventures closes $21 million fund to back the next Tesla or Patagonia,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/05/better-ventures-closes-21-million-fund-to-back-the-next-tesla-or-patagonia/,2017/01/05,"
Oakland-based venture capital firm Better Ventures recently closed its second fund at $21 million according to cofounder and managing director Wes Selke.
The firm was originally founded as an accelerator called Hub Ventures to help social entrepreneurs running so-called “triple bottom line” startups. These companies measure their success not only by revenue and profitability, but also by their products’ quantified, positive social or environmental impact.
Famous examples of social ventures include outdoor gear and apparel makers Patagonia, which  promises to protect and preserve the environment, and Tesla Motors which aims to “accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy” with electric vehicles and now solar products.
By 2013, after running the accelerator for three years, Selke said that he and cofounder and general partner Rick Moss decided to become more of a “high engagement seed fund.” That would allow them to invest higher amounts of capital into for profit, for good companies, and stick with founders for more than a few months of bootcamp-style mentorship, he explained.
Limited partners in Better Ventures’ second fund are a mix of high net worth individuals, and mission-based investors. They include: Prudential’s corporate social responsibility group, the Schmidt Family Foundation, Treehouse Investments, and individual VC’s and tech executives including Foundry’s Brad Feld, KPCB’s Tina Ju, Evernote CEO Chris O’Neill, and Recurrent Energy CEO Arno Harris.
Better Ventures will typically invest between $250,000 and $400,000 in early stage companies, reserving some capital for follow-on rounds at the Series A and B stage in those startups. But what qualifies as an “impact” investment when so many companies talk a good game about changing the world today?
Better Ventures cofounders Wes Selke and Rick Moss outside of their offices in Oakland, Calif.
Selke said:
“A large number of companies claim to be good for people or the environment. And some industries are inherently ‘good,’ like healthcare or education. But a lot of startups make products that will only be available to people who can afford to spend, and that could actually exasperate divides in our society. A good litmus test is to ask if your company’s product or service closes an opportunity gap in society.”
Better Ventures’ portfolio includes startups working on everything from cleantech, to health, HR and financial services today. Among these are: SunFunder, which helps communities finance off-grid solar projects; LeadGenius, which helps un- and under-employed people find new ways to make a living; and Iris Plans which helps patients with serious chronic illnesses to navigate a complex medical and insurance system.
More than half of Better Ventures’ portfolio companies are based in the East Bay, mostly Oakland and Berkeley close to the firm’s own offices at Oakland’s Impact Hub. Although most recently, the firm participated in a $1 million seed round for New York City startup, WERK, which is building a marketplace of flexible work opportunities specifically for women.
Better Ventures is especially interested in backing companies that make renewable energy more affordable and accessible, or whose products serve un- and underemployed people, or those who don’t have disposable income and reliable access to tech and financial services.
But a mission-based approach doesn’t mean the firm is overlooking financial fundamentals. Selke said, “As soon as you say impact investing a lot of people will roll their eyes and think ‘concessionary returns.’ But we only invest in startups that have an opportunity to build a very exciting, scalable business.
Our investment angle is that entrepreneurs are just more intrinsically motivated when they’re personally connected to a problem they are solving. When they are mission driven, they can also attract and retain top talent, people who are looking for a higher purpose in their work, which we are seeing play out in our portfolio.”

187,Tesla’s Gigafactory starts mass producing battery cells,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/04/teslas-gigafactory-starts-mass-producing-battery-cells/,2017/01/04,"
Tesla’s massive Nevada Gigafactory has started producing lithium-ion battery cells in mass capacity, with the aim of supplying products including the upcoming Model 3 electric vehicle and the Powerwall 2 home energy supply unit, and the Powerpack 2 commercial solar energy storage product. It’s a big step for the automaker, since production volume of the batteries it produces with partner Panasonic will be a key choke point in terms of ramping production and making good on Model 3 delivery timelines.
The Gigafactory officially held its grand opening last year, but its focus thus far has been on assembling prior products like the original Powerwall, and preparing the facility for production of next-gen products at scale; Panasonic and Tesla’s new jointly designed cylindrical 2170 cells in particular, which is aimed at optimizing performance for cost in a form factor that can be used both at home and in vehicles. Production of the 2170 for qualification, which is to say for testing and quality assurance purposes ahead of mass production, started in December.
Starting today, cells made in the Gigafactory will be used in production Powerwall 2 and Powerpack 2 unit, and the aim is to start building battery cells destined for Model 3 cars starting in the second quarter of 2017. Tesla says it aims to have capacity ramped to the point where its production of lithium-ion cells tops 35 GWh/year, which is almost at the current electric battery production capacity of all the world’s suppliers combined.
While the Gigafactory is operational, it is far from complete – the design Tesla used allows it to open different phases for business as construction finishes on each, which is what will help them use it to build production batteries now, but also scale to much greater production capacity over time. At the current stage, the factory is under 30 percent done, yet still manages to occupy 1.9 million square feet, Tesla says, with interior operational space of 4.9 million square feet total because of how it’s using different floors.
The Gigafactory is looking to not only satisfy Tesla’s growing demand in terms of volume, but also drop the individual cost of batteries through se of automated production capacity, and improved processes that will result in fewer units being discarded for defects and failure to meet standards after they’re produced. Tesla also notes that despite its use of highly automated production line tech, the Gigafactory will itself eventually employ 6,500 people directly.
Tesla reported Tuesday that it built 83,922 vehicles across 2016, but delivered 76,230, under its target of 80,000 for the year. It cited missed shipping cut-offs and also production challenges caused by the shift to Tesla HW2 sensor packages in Model X and S vehicles, which changes the sensor and on-board computing load out to pave the way for eventual introduction of full self-driving features. Still, boosted battery production will definitely contribute to Tesla being able to meet its goals in the future.

188,This electric bus company just raised $140 million,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/03/this-electric-bus-company-just-raised-140-million/,2017/01/03,"
According to Proterra, a Burlingame, Ca.-based company, its zero-emission electric buses can drive a stunning 350 miles one charge — and on city streets, no less.
With that kind of claim, it’s no wonder investors just poured $140 million into the outfit, which began garnering heightened press attention last year but has been quietly working on its technology for the last 12 years, raising a previous $150 million in equity and debt over that period.
Among its new and earlier investors: Tao Capital Partners, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, GM Ventures, Constellation Technology Ventures, Obvious Ventures, 88 Green Ventures, Edison Energy, and an undisclosed sovereign wealth fund in the Middle East.
What excites these VCs are, at least in part, the environmental benefits that Proterra is promising. Even diesel-fueled city buses reduce greenhouse gas emissions thanks to the number of people they carry versus passenger cars.  Electric buses can reduce them even further (unless, as Wired has pointed out, a city derives all of its electricity by burning coal).
Yet Proterra’s buses are likely compelling to municipalities for a host of other reasons, including a regenerative breaking system that can almost fully recharge each bus’s two mattress-sized battery packs via kinetic energy, and less onerous maintenance costs. (Electric drive trains generally suffer less wear and tear, as Proterra is keen to point out to reporters.)
As for how many are willing to pay for the buses, which cost $799,000 — or twice as much as diesel buses — the answer is plenty, seemingly. Proterra’s sales more than doubled in 2016 from the previous year, according to the company. More specifically, Proterra says it has so far sold more than 300 vehicles to 35 city, university, and commercial transit agencies throughout North America.
For added context, the company, which also offers a no-money-down leasing model, says its buses accounted for 1 percent of new bus orders in the U.S. in 2015. it believes that number reached 5 percent in 2016.

189,Ford to build new all-electric SUV and autonomous hybrid at Michigan plant,https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/03/ford-to-build-new-all-electric-suv-and-autonomous-hybrid-at-michigan-plant/,2017/01/03,"
Ford has announced plans at CES to build a range of new electric and hybrid-electric vehicles, revealing plans for seven of its total 13 planned electric cars set for arrival in the next five years. These include a brand-new, fully electric small SUV, and a new fully autonomous car that will be the basis of its new electric ride-hailing fleet, with a target debut date of 2021.
The new Ford vehicles will be built at the carmaker’s Flat Rock, Michigan plant, as part of a planned expansion of that facility with a $700 million investment. This will come at the cost of a $1.6 billion planned Mexico plant project, which Ford is also cancelling as announced today.
Ford’s new vehicle plans also include a hybrid F-150, targeting 2020 for availability as is the new all-electric truck, and a hybrid Mustang, also destined for the Flat Rock facility and aiming for 2020. Other vehicles include a plug-in Transit Custom, and hybrid cars designed for police use, which are going to be built in Chicago.
Ford’s planned vehicles will use Ford’s next-generation EV tech, which enters testing this year. It’s also going to debut a range of new services that are designed to help ease the transition to EVs for drivers and take away headaches related to things like charging.
The most interesting part of this announcement might be the specific plans for Ford’s new autonomous vehicle fleet. Ford says it’s targeting “high-volume” production for this car, which makes sense if it indeed wants to deploy the cars en masse to service dense urban environments where car ownership is on the decline.

190,Automakers aren’t really advertising electric vehicles,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/20/automakers-arent-really-advertising-electric-vehicles/,2016/12/20,"
There are more plug-in vehicles available now than there were a decade ago, and the sales of those vehicles are growing. Sales of electric vehicles are up about a third this year over last year, and November 2016 marked 14 consecutive months of record-setting EV sales in the U.S.
And yet the grand total of all plug-in vehicles sold in the U.S. in 2016 (not counting December) was just shy of 134,000. The total number of light-duty vehicles (cars, pickup trucks, SUVs, etc.) sold in November 2016 alone was 1.38 million — 10 times the EVs sold over a period of 11 months.
One reason EVs aren’t selling might be that they’re not being advertised. The Sierra Club commissioned a study that tracked automotive advertising in 2015. The result in a nutshell: manufacturers advertise for their gasoline-powered vehicles far more than for their electric-powered cars.
In a stark example, in 2015, Ford advertised the gas-powered Focus about 4,750 times to a national audience on tier-1 cable and broadcast TV channels. It advertised the electric-powered Focus about 200 times to a national TV audience. The Mercedes-Benz C-Class small gas-powered sedan was advertised about 1,400 times nationally, while the B-class EV got no national advertising time at all that year.
Nissan fared a little better in the results. Sort of. The gasoline-only Sentra was advertised 3,500 times nationally over the year, while the electric-only LEAF was advertised about 1,700 times — but only in California. But the Sentra was only advertised in California markets a couple hundred times, so markets matter.
In California, there are 22 electric models at dealerships, but in other states the pickings are far slimmer. The next best markets for EVs offer 14 different models; a half dozen states have zero EV models available at dealerships.
In some cases, it hardly matters if car makers advertise for these cars. Another Sierra Club project found that even if there are EVs at dealerships, they sometimes weren’t even charged up enough to test drive.
Tesla is at the top of this heap, as you’d expect. It only sells electric cars, it sells the most electric cars and its salespeople are knowledgeable about EVs. Also, they have charged cars to test drive.
Maybe the introduction of the Chevy Bolt and Chrysler Pacifica plug-in hybrid minivan will change the advertising landscape next year. Maybe the nine states following California’s zero-emissions vehicles (ZEV) standards will convince auto manufacturers to advertise their plug-in cars. Electric vehicles don’t work everywhere for everyone, but they work in a lot of places for a lot of people. Maybe that’s all the ads have to say to convince skeptical buyers to test drive a charged EV.

California-based Lucid Motors revealed its first car today, a fully electric sedan aimed at the “executive” market, with a 400-mile range rating from its onboard 100kWh battery, a 2.5-second 0-60 mph time and a target market date of 2018. The vehicle prototype was shown off today at a special unveiling event in Fremont, California.
Lucid’s founding team includes CTO Peter Rawlinson, a former Tesla team member, as well as Derek Jenkins, previously of Mazda and VW and BMW alum Brian Barron. The Lucid Motors plan is to build these electric vehicles starting in 2017 in Arizona, at a new factory facility that’s set to bring around 2,000 new jobs to the sate according to the company and Arizona Governor Doug Ducey.

Rawlinson previously noted that the cars would boast a combined 1,000 horsepower across its electric motors, and that there would be a version made available with a max 400-mile estimated range. The vehicle will also have some autonomous features, according to Rawlinson’s previous statements.
Previous prototypes have been displayed with the signature black and white camouflage of vehicles worn prior to their official debut, but we did have an idea of what the Air would look like. It’s more impressive without the obfuscating cladding, however, if perhaps a bit more sober and sensible looking than its competition from Tesla, for instance.
That “executive” moniker that Lucid keeps throwing around with this vehicle is a pretty good indicator of what you can expect in terms of price, which hasn’t yet been made official. Over $100,000 is where Lucid is setting expectations for early releases, with lots of options included.

The sedan approach is also more pronounced in the Lucid Air’s design than it is with the Model S, which suggests it may be looking to compete more with vehicles like the BMW 7 series (in fact, it previously released images comparing it to that and the Mercedes S-Class, like the one above).
Lucid also has a partnership in place with Samsung SDI, the battery-focused subsidiary of the Korean tech giant. Lucid has raised over $130 million across three rounds of venture funding, including from the Chinese Environmental Fund.
Lucid’s vehicle looks interesting, but it’s going to be a very different market in 2018 when this car launches, with EV entries from many of the major luxury brands joining the fray at around the same time. The challenge will be getting to the starting line, but new players still might have some advantages over legacy automakers when it comes to electric, even if the established brands are accelerating their EV plans.

192,Chevrolet delivers its first Bolt EVs to customers,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/13/chevrolet-delivers-its-first-bolt-evs-to-customers/,2016/12/13,"Chevrolet has delivered its first three Bolt EVs to customers, making its success in delivering a long-range all-electric car available at a decent price official. The company’s first three customers are based in California, and all took delivery in the Bay area.

Chevrolet had said that it would be delivering the Bolt by the end of 2016, and it made good on that promise by putting these first cars in the hands of customers now in December. The car’s sticker price is $37,495, which lets it just squeak under the $30,000 barrier (when considering green tax credits) that it and other EV makers like Tesla are trying to hit in order to break the affordable cost barrier for the average consumer.
The Bolt also offers 238 miles of EPA-estimated range, which is more than the 215 miles claimed by Tesla for the upcoming Model 3, with which it will compete directly.

Henrik Fisker’s newest electric car company, Fisker Inc., continues the gradual reveal of its first car, the EMotion. I certainly have a lot of feelings looking at this — feelings like skepticism that this vehicle will ever make it to production. But Fisker Inc. maintains that it will, and that once it does, it’ll have a 161 MPH top speed with 400 miles of range from its on-board electric powerhouse.
Fisker Inc. previously showed us some images of the car’s profile and front (embedded below), and now it’s ready to reveal the back. The back of the car features “wide sculptural shoulders, thin light blue tail lights, wide trunk opening, and aggressive lower rear diffuser to improve aero,” according to the company.

Also new in this image is the shiny metallic paint job, which is a contrast from the matte appearance of the previously released renders. You can also see the back of the color contrast roof, which will likely be a full-length panorama-style sunroof, and the gadget, which looks just like the badge from the original Fisker, whose assets were purchased by a Chinese company and relaunched as Karma Automotive.
Fisker Inc. says we’ll hear more about the vehicle and its plans in 2017, but we’ll still have to wait until at least the middle of next year to get a better idea of when exactly these things might start to ship.

194,Jay-Z backed JetSmarter raises $105 million to become Uber for private jets,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/12/jay-z-backed-jetsmarter-raises-105-million-to-become-uber-for-private-jets/,2016/12/12,"
JetSmarter has raised $105 million in Series C funding, at a $1.5 billion pre-money valuation, to build its marketplace for private jet services, according to Sergey Petrossov, the startup’s founder and CEO.
The massive funding round will be used primarily for global expansion of JetSmarter in Asia and Latin America, Petrossov said, and increasing the number of routes and flights available to JetSmarter members in the U.S.
The company’s app, which TechCrunch reviewed here, allows travelers to book a seat on a private jet via the company’s JetShuttle service, or to charter an entire plane if their entourage rolls deep.
While anyone can download and evaluate its app, before flying JetSmarter, members go through a light background check then pay $15,000 for a “core membership” in the first year they join. Members then get a seat on a wide selection of flights “free,” but have to pay for companion tickets if they want to bring a non-member along or pay to charter whole planes.

Members of the Saudi royal family, and hip hop icon and entrepreneur Shawn “Jay-Z” Carter, earlier backers of JetSmarter, increased their investments in the startup with this round.
New investors in JetSmarter included an Abu Dhabi-based equity fund, JetEdge (the global private aviation company that operates fleets of large cabin jets), KZ Capital in London, a Qatar-based private equity fund and other strategic backers the company did not have permission to name.
Today, JetSmarter connects travelers to flights in 50 markets around the world, including New York, Chicago, Fort Lauderdale, Las Vegas, Atlanta, London, Paris, Moscow, Dubai, Milan and other business and leisure travel hubs. Petrossov said he wants to expand to be available in 80 to 100 markets by the end of 2017.
And the company wants to connect more cities on the U.S. map, including connecting Florida destinations to Boston, New York and Washington, D.C., and San Francisco to Seattle.
XOJET President and CEO Bradley Stewart, who is also a senior advisor to private equity firm TPG, has joined JetSmarter’s board with the most recent round of funding. The companies earlier struck a partnership that allowed JetSmarter to expand its offering of flights in North America.
Competitors to JetSmarter include subscription, “all you can fly” travel providers like SurfAir, and other membership-driven private jet services like WheelsUp or StrataJet. 
Sergey Petrossov, JetSmarter CEO
JetSmarter has been able to grow rapidly in private aviation where other players, like Beacon or BlackJet, which was also counted Jay-Z among its backers, have faded away.
Petrossov said, “We scale from the community. We use predictive maps and algorithms to find where the demand is, so that we will never over supply the market, and can just meet the amount of demand we have. Other companies would over supply and fly where they’d have 20% loads. We have zero deadhead weight on our shuttles and a 90% load factor.”
JetSmarter doesn’t own any planes, but instead works with operators, owners and carriers who manage and maintain the planes, hire pilots and deal with safety and compliance issues for the heavily regulated industry.
Being a software-driven, asset-light business, Petrossov and his backers often compare JetSmarter to an Uber for the skies.
The company is hoping to go even further in that direction with something like “on-demand” access to seats on a select number of private flights for non-members. They would pay basically $1 per mile for shorter trips, like Boston to New York, potentially.
Petrossov said, “Everything we do is about making flying fun again.”

195,"Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and 18 others commit $1 billion to new cleantech fund, Breakthrough Energy Ventures",https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/11/bill-gates-jeff-bezos-and-18-others-commit-1-billion-to-new-cleantech-fund-breakthrough-energy-ventures/,2016/12/11,"
Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Vinod Khosla, Jack Ma, John Doerr and 15 other high-profile investors have formed a new venture firm, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, that will pour at least $1 billion into cleantech companies over the next 20 years.
The firm’s goal, according to its own website, will be: “to provide everyone in the world with access to reliable, affordable power, food, goods, transportation, and services without contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.”
BEV will invest in tech ventures at any stage, from seed through commercialization. The deals will focus on electricity, manufacturing, agriculture, buildings and transportation.
Cleantech was once the rage in Silicon Valley, with total venture capital dollars invested in clean tech hitting $6.1 billion in 2008 before the recession. But cleantech became a dirty word following the cratering of startups that had taken venture capital, as well as significant amounts of government loans, grants, subsidies or tax credits.
Along with scores of others that shut down, failing to save the planet or to realize meaningful returns for investors, were: solar panel makers Solyndra; Aptera, which attempted to make highly fuel-efficient cars; and waste-to-fuel company Kior. (Remember them?)
But a burgeoning world population, and energy needs growing along with it, are driving up demand for technology that can help people produce more of what they need with fewer resources. So cleantech is drawing investments and being discussed again, favorably, even if some VC’s avoid labeling their portfolio companies as such.
BEV is the formal, venture investing initiative of the Breakthrough Energy Coalition, a group announced at the 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference.
The group, comprised of tech and finance all-stars, pledged to invest in early-stage startups in nations that were ramping up their public, R&D funding for cleantech, to reach a collective $30 billion by 2020.
Besides making its venture fund known, BEV published a framework today called the “Landscape of Innovation,” which it intends to be “a guide to other public and private investors committed to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.”

Droughts, climate change and deforestation are putting forests at risk worldwide, so studying these ecosystems closely is more important than ever — but it’s a hell of a lot of work to climb every tree in the Sierra Nevada. Drones and advanced imaging, however, present an increasingly practical alternative to that, as this UC Berkeley project shows.

Todd Dawson, an ecologist at the university, spends a lot of time up in trees, measuring limbs, checking growth and so on. As you can imagine, it’s slow, dangerous and demanding work — which is why a collaboration with drone maker Parrot and imaging tech company Pix4D was appealing.
“Before, a team of five to seven people would climb and spend a week or more in one tree mapping it all around. With a drone, we could do that with a two-minute flight. We can map the leaf area by circling the tree, then do some camera work inside the canopy, and we have the whole tree in a day,” Dawson said in a Berkeley news release.

Drones are, of course, commonly used in forestry and agriculture, but this particular setup is very focused on quickly and repeatedly profiling individual trees. Pix4D’s “Sequoia” camera collects light in a variety of complementary wavelengths — a useful technique called multispectral imaging — while also building a detailed 3D point cloud using LIDAR. Between the two, the resulting data can show overall health and growth; it can also be collected repeatedly over weeks or months, creating a time-lapse view.

Processing and storing the data is becoming less troublesome as well; Pix4D created software to quickly turn around the data and make it accessible for this particular purpose. All that data can feed into prediction models for other things: overall leaf area can help predict carbon exchange, and growth or health patterns can be mapped to climatic or anthropological ones.
Dawson’s project was a pilot; Parrot and Pix4D are also launching a “Climate innovation grant” through which researchers can get access to drones and imaging hardware — any topic “from archaeology to zoology,” as long as it will “foster innovation in understanding and mitigating the impacts of climate change.”

197,AeroVironment: official charger of the Chevy Bolt,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/06/aerovironment-official-charger-of-the-chevy-bolt/,2016/12/06,"
The 2017 Chevy Bolt is coming to California and Oregon before the end of 2016, and along with it comes its very own official charger from AeroVironment.
The company’s EVSE-RS charger has been available for some time, and AeroVironment is not new to the EV charging game. The company is kind of an unofficial charger for everyone else; it sells models compatible with just about every EV on the market — Ford, Fiat, BMW, Nissan, Toyota even Tesla. And though it’s available through dealerships that sell the Bolt, the AeroVironment charger doesn’t come with the car like a prize in a Cracker Jack box. It’s an official accessory that buyers will have to purchase. The retail price for the 30-amp 240-volt charger is about $1,000.
It is a Level 2 charger, which means it will charge your Bolt (or any EV) five times faster than plugging the car into a regular household outlet, which is known in the EV universe as Level 1 charging. The EVSE-RS is rated to be used indoors or out, so if you don’t have room inside the garage to park your car, it can be installed elsewhere so you can charge in the driveway.
No other electric vehicle on the market right now has an official charger. Tesla does have the Wall Connector home charger that is designed to work with its cars, but both the car and charger are made by a single company. Other companies like ChargePoint, GE, Siemens and JuiceBox all make home EV chargers that you can buy on Amazon. So it may be easier to buy an AeroVironment charger at the dealership when you buy your Bolt, but it’s not absolutely required.

198,Google says it will hit 100% renewable energy by 2017,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/06/google-says-it-will-hit-100-renewable-energy-by-2017/,2016/12/06,"
Green energy projects for data centers and other facilities are goals for a lot of tech companies, but one of the largest – Google – now says it’s going to tip the scale at 100% renewable energy powering its entire global operations by 2017. Google notes this will include both its data centers and its corporate offices.
How’d it get here? Google kicked off its large-scale direct investments in renewable energy beginning in 2010, with the acquisition of the entirety of the power generated by a 114-megawatt Iowa wind farm. Now, Google claims the title of the “world’s largest corporate buyer of renewable power,” with renewable purchasing on a scale that’s more than twice as large as its next closest competitor, Amazon.
While it’s not quite there, Google says it will cross the 100% mark next year due to its commitments to purchase enough direct wind and solar-sourced power to match its annual consumption for the year. Google isn’t being solely charitable with this drive to adopt green power, either; it notes in a blog post that solar, wind and renewables as a general category is becoming the cheapest source of power around, meaning that as its data center operation costs grow with an increasing investment in cloud-based services, it makes the most fiscal sense for Google to continue to invest in creating new renewable sources to help meet its growing demand.
That’s why the company says it’s not going to stop its investments in renewable power generation project development once it crosses the 100% mark; they’re not treating it as a finish line, in other words, and are instead looking to further diversify their power sources so they’re not so reliant on wind, for instance; plus, Google still sources a lot of its power from renewable energy credits, which means it may actually be getting power directly from non-renewable sources in some areas, but it’s paying for enough generation in other locations with renewable sources that it’s getting credit for excess production that’s going back into the grid for other consumers.
Google is also releasing its first comprehensive environmental report (embedded below) alongside today’s announcement, which details its efforts to minimize its environmental footprint, and also includes information about other green initiatives at the company. There’s also a new environmental website that will collect hat kind of info on an ongoing basis.

Other tech giants have made similar claims and set similar goals, including Apple, which announced in September that it’s joining the RE100 global initiative which comes with a goal of achieving 100 percent renewable energy sourcing. Apple has also previously claimed a 93 percent renewable energy use rate for its global operations, and also said that its organizations in the U.S., China and 21 additional companies are already at 100 percent renewable power.

199,Tyson Foods launches new venture fund to back food and agriculture startups,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/05/tyson-foods-launches-new-venture-fund-to-back-food-and-agriculture-startups/,2016/12/05,"
Tyson Foods Inc., one of the world’s largest makers and marketers of meat products, has announced the formation of a $150 million venture capital fund to back food and agriculture startups.
According to Tyson’s Executive Vice President of Strategy and New Ventures, Monica McGurk, the fund will seek to invest in startups solving problems around food production, distribution, nutrition, food waste and safety.
The new venture arm will invest opportunistically in startups it is impressed by along these lines, and will not limit its deals to early-stage or mature companies only, nor to a particular product or technology-type.
That means Tyson could be investing in everything from new types of packaging that can give a chicken a longer shelf-life, to sensors, software or robotics that can reduce food waste in factories or at restaurants, or innovation that’s more around a great new food brand.
Perhaps surprisingly, Tyson is even interested in backing companies developing “alternative proteins,” as industry insiders call them, which are often vegetarian or vegan-friendly meat replacements.
Tyson already took a stake in Beyond Meat, which makes plant-based patties that aspire to have the same taste, juiciness and grill-ability of real beef burgers.
That deal and others like it have been seen as a sign of sea changes in the meat industry in response to consumers’ concerns about global environmental issues and health.
Oxford researchers published a study earlier this year that forecast, “A global switch to diets that rely less on meat and more on fruit and vegetables could save up to 8 million lives by 2050, reduce greenhouse gas emissions by two thirds, and lead to healthcare-related savings and avoided climate damages of $1.5 trillion.”
A Tyson spokesperson said, “Our interest in Beyond Meat reflects our desire to offer consumers choices and to consider how we can serve an ever-growing and diverse global population, while remaining focused on our core prepared foods and animal protein businesses.”
While Tyson is based in Springdale, Arkansas its new fund, Tyson New Ventures LLC, will be headquartered in Chicago, a hotbed of activity for food tech startups since the rise of Grubhub and home to other food-and-ag venture firms including S2G Ventures and Cultivian Sandbox Ventures.
Mary-Kay James will lead the investment team at the new fund. Prior to joining Tyson, James was the Managing Director of Agriculture, Nutrition & Health investments for DuPont Ventures, and Chairwoman of the NVCA Corporate Venture Group.
McGurk said that one reason Tyson decided to break off a serious chunk of capital to back startups was that consumer goods are an area lacking attention from corporate VCs.
Plenty of money from private equity and venture capital funds has flowed to food, she noted.
And other food giants including Campbell Soup’s Acre Venture Partners or Kellog’s Eighteen94 Capital have started venture investing, but are doing in partnership with outisde venture capitalists, rather than building their funds completely in-house.
“We have the ability to finance entrepreneurs and give them oxygen, but we have capabilities to help accelerate their growth and improve the odds of success for them,” McGurk said.
Specifically, the new fund plans to help its portfolio companies, or other startups it is evaluating for investment, to connect with experts in various departments of Tyson Foods for everything from research and product testing to business development.
A startup working on technology to help restaurants reduce food waste may find it easy to meet one or two restaurateurs and test out new technology on a limited basis. But McGurk said, “It can be hard to make a technical solution work in a real operating environment at scale, especially if you have never been in the food service industry.”
Tyson has connections to thousands of restaurants, food retailers and farms that raise chickens and other livestock for it.
And the company runs a massive “chill chain,” and food distribution system, not to mention culinary test kitchens, and teams that build huge data banks of consumer insights on food preferences and what’s driving growth in food.
Updates: We added a comment to this post from a Tyson spokesperson to clarify the rationale behind the company’s investment in Beyond Meat, a company developing vegetarian products that feel and taste like beef.

200,New leaf-like nano surface could boost solar panel efficiency,https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/01/new-leaf-like-nano-surface-could-boost-solar-panel-efficiency/,2016/12/01,"
We often look to nature for tips on how to build better tech, and few things in nature are better at harnessing the power of the sun than the leaves of ordinary plants. Researchers at the University of Oulu in Finland have discovered a way to build coatings that can mimic the surface of the leaves of plants, which could eventually lead to solar panels that lose less of their captured energy to reflection. And that could be very interesting to tech companies, including Tesla.
The new nano-scale surface can’t make solar panels receive any more light – but they can prevent more from bouncing off and failing to transfer their energy into a usable form. This could lead to an increase of up to 17 percent using the coating. And because of its size (researchers have created a coating with a thickness of only one millionth of a millimeter) and broad applicability, researchers say it can be applied to a number of materials, including glass and silicon, without altering their outward appearance.
Tesla unveiled its own glass solar roof tile earlier this year, and at the event during a Q&A with reporters after the main presentation, Tesla CEO Elon Musk noted that the company was pursuing tech that would do exactly what this Oulu research team has accomplished – enable panels to capture more of the light normally lost to reflection, in order to boost overall panel efficiency to beyond what’s possible even with traditional panels today.
The Oulu researchers suggest that even further increases in efficiency may be possible, since they can take the work they’ve done mimicking natural light-gathering surfaces and try to “exceed the results of evolution” by combining different applicable models.
Musk said that Tesla is working with current solar roof tile partner 3M on its future coatings, so this could be a process in development simultaneously in multiple organizations. But the tech, should it be commercialized, would do lots to help push the solar market forward, given the value of any significant efficiency increases in panel design.

A new joint venture between major carmakers will attempt to make it easier to get around Europe using electric cars, thanks to a network of chargers with up to 350 kW charging capacity, which could drastically reduce overall charging times compared to what’s available today. The team-up includes BMW, Daimler, Ford and Volkswagen, and plans for roll-out of the fast-charging stations call for installations to start in 2017.
Initially, the venture has identified 400 sites in Europe, with the ultimate aim of delivering as many as “thousands” of charge points by 2020 (which is, not coincidentally, around when many of the product lines of the participating car makers are expected to skew more heavily towards EVs).
The base technology upon which the network will be based is called Combined Charging System (CCS), which is a quick-charging method that uses a combo AC/DC connector referred to as the “Combo Coupler” in order to deliver a max 350 kW delivery charging rate. The standard is supported by BW, BMW, Daimler, and Ford, but also by Hyundai, GM and FCA.
The newly released Chevy Bolt uses CCS, for instance, and the standard is controlled by the Charging Interface Initiative, a group founded by Audi, BMW, Daimler, VW and more specifically to push CCS as an industry standard. Tesla joined the standards body in March of this year, and was reported in February to be working on an adapter that would help it support the standard used by CCS chargers.

202,Faraday Future’s factory construction paused; shipping timelines at risk,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/24/faraday-futures-factory-construction-paused-shipping-timelines-at-risk/,2016/11/24,"
Electric vehicle maker Faraday Future may not be able to make its first cars in time to hit its 2017 shipping deadlines, according to a new report by the Financial Times on Thursday. It’s hard to ship a car when your factory itself isn’t finished — FF’s Nevada-based manufacturing facility broke ground in April, but construction has since been paused because, according to state treasurer Dan Schwartz speaking to the FT, it hasn’t paid bills owed by the company to its construction partner.
The delay is temporary, according to comments made by general contractor Aecom, which is working with Faraday on the project, and construction will resume some time in early 2017. That’s going to push out the completion date considerably, and will make it quite difficult for FF to make its previously stated production timeline. FT also spoke to an anonymous former employee who said deliveries to customers within the 2017 time frame were “not possible.”
Part of the issue may be that primary financial backer LeEco has publicly acknowledged difficulties related to available cash, and the large investment its made in building cars, both itself and via partners like Faraday Future, was cited as one cause. LeEco recently raised an additional $600 million, but given Faraday’s financial reliance on LeEco, the Chinese company’s cash problems combined with this news of the factory delay don’t bode well.
Faraday Future has promised to show off its first production vehicle (pictured in a spy shot above) at CES in January, after revealing a Batmobile-like FFZERO1 concept last year. We’ll likely learn more about its anticipated schedule for delivering said vehicle at that time, too, and there will clearly be a lot riding on what they present at the show.

203,Maserati plans an all-electric Alfieri for 2020,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/24/maserati-plans-an-all-electric-alfieri-for-2020/,2016/11/24,"
Maserati was said to be looking at 2020 as the target time frame for its first production electric vehicle, and now the company has confirmed to Autocar that a battery-powered electric drivetrain option will be made available in 2020 for its Alfieri two-seater sports car.
The EV version will follow the conventional fuel-based V6-powered Alfieri, which is slated to make its product debut some time in 2019. Part of the reason for the launch window being out further is that the chassis design used in the Alfieri requires weight savings and energy economy improvements, which Maserati is currently working on; its existing product design plans are due for refresh after 2018.
The report of Maserati’s Alfieri plans follows an earlier account by Car and Driver that their first vehicle would be a “grand-touring coupe” rather than a direct competitor for the Tesla Model S, but that it would also likely be a significant departure for Maserati in terms of its signature vehicle design.

204,Tesla and SolarCity made this whole island solar-powered in under a year,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/22/tesla-and-solarcity-made-this-whole-island-solar-powered-in-under-a-year/,2016/11/22,"

Tesla and SolarCity’s union is still very fresh, but the combined companies are already highlighting what they’ve been able to accomplish even just as partners. The SolarCity blog details a project in which SolarCity power generation and Tesla Powerpack-based storage helped the small island of Ta’u in American Samoa fix its spotty power problem and cut its reliance on a diesel generator grid.
The diesel reliance isn’t new – a lot of island communities rely on burning the fossil fuel in order to maintain an electrical grid. But use of a fuel that must be shipped in at considerable cost and from a great distance poses a number of problems, and leads to a lot of temporary blackouts. Solar’s costs are typically recouped over a long period of time when grid power is convenient and readily available, but the financial benefits should accrue much more quickly when you’re shipping in and burning fuel as your only source of energy.
The Ta’u grid project involved creating a SolarCity panel array made up of over 5,300 panels capable of generating 1.4 megawatts of solar capacity, combined with a Tesla Powerpack commercial battery storage facility with 6 megawatt hours of reserve capability across 60 Powerpacks. The resulting micro grid can provide three full days of power for the island’s 600 residents at max capacity, and recharges fully after just seven hours of solid sunlight exposure.

Start to finish, Tesla and SolarCity’s Ta’u microgrid project came together within a year. The project was funded by the EPA, the Department of the Interior and the American Samoa Economic Development Authority. Tesla is clearly hoping this acts as an example to other potential customers, and it also shows at commercial scale why Musk believes the solar battery portion of the business will one day exceed the market for Teslas – there are plenty of spots where reliable, independent power holds more appeal than an electric vehicle.

205,Volkswagen will begin making electric cars in North America in 2021,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/22/volkswagen-will-begin-making-electric-cars-in-north-america-in-2021/,2016/11/22,"
Volkswagen’s EV plans include manufacturing in North America starting in 2021, according to the company. The new production expansion is part of VW’s goal to ramp up to sales of 1 million electric vehicles globally by 2025, as electric becomes “the strategic core of the VW brand,” according to Volkswagen brand lead Herbert Diess speaking to Automotive News. Part of the electric push is to help VW increase its profit margin long-term, with EVs replacing fuel-burning models that aren’t selling well.
Volkswagen has Mexican assembly facilities for the Jetta, Golf and Beetle, but only has a single factory in the U.S. currently, while the vast majority of its manufacturing facilities are located in Europe. The company will be “stepping up” activities in the U.S., according to Diess, with a focus on producing vehicles that resonate with that market, including large SUVs and limousines, according to the brand leader.
While Volkswagen already offers electric drive version of existing vehicles, including the Golf, the company’s first pure EV design debuted in September at the Paris Motor Show. The I.D. concept is designed for production beginning in 2020, VW said at the time.

206,NextEV’s new NIO EP9 electric supercar holds a Nürburgring world record,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/21/nextevs-new-nio-ep9-electric-supercar-holds-a-nurburgring-world-record/,2016/11/21,"

Chinese electric car maker NextEV has debuted its NIO brand, along with the first car from that electric car line, called the EP9. The first vehicle it revealed is already a world-record holder: it has the fastest lap time for an EV at the Nürbhurgring Nordschliefe test track in Germany, one of the most famous proving grounds for supercars.
The EP9 also beat the EV record at France’s Circuit Paul Ricard by around 50 seconds. EP9’s specs include a 0-124mph speed of 7.1 seconds, and a top speed of around 200mph. It also has a 0-60mph time of 2.7 seconds – which, astute EV fans will note, is actually 0.2 seconds slower than the current production model of the Tesla P100D with the Ludicrous Mode option (and soon to be 0.3 seconds slower, thanks to a speed-boosting easter egg update going out to Teslas in December).
Tesla has called its P100D the “fastest production car in the world,” so the EP9’s claim of being the “world’s fastest electric car” will definitely need direct head-to-head testing to prove the validity of one or the other. The EP9 isn’t quite a product vehicle yet, however – today’s unveiling isn’t a sales announcement.

The performance is impressive, however, and the car also has a charging system designed to provide a full “tank” in just 45 minutes, with a max range of around 265 miles. The EP9 is probably a stage-setter for NIO overall, as the company says it’s intended to be a “best-in-class” and “showcase” product in a release announcing the car.
NextEV’s U.S. CEO Padmasree Warrior explained in an interview with TechCrunch last December that she was looking for an opportunity to “build something from the ground up and make it big” in taking on the role at NextEV, and this debut car from the company definitely looks to fit that bill.

207,Tesla officially acquires SolarCity,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/21/tesla-officially-acquires-solarcity/,2016/11/21,"
Tesla’s acquisition of SolarCity officially closed Monday morning, bringing together Elon Musk’s electric vehicle company with the solar energy company founded by his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive. The deal was approved by Tesla and SolarCity shareholders last week, after first being proposed earlier this year.
Tesla provided the following brief statement on the news:
We’re pleased to announce that Tesla’s acquisition of SolarCity closed this morning.
Succinct, and probably an understatement – Musk has been advocating for the union of the two companies vocally and frequently since proposing the idea in June. Joining the two entities is central to the continued execution of his “Master Plan,” which aims to provide customers with full-stack solutions for owning their own energy production, storage and consumption.
Tesla’s recent solar roof tile launch showed why Musk believes the companies are a natural fit under a unified Tesla roof (I woke up very early, please allow me this joke). To Musk, there is not a demarcation point beyond clean generation of electric power and vehicles that make use of said power for emission-free operation. It makes sense, because the cleanliness and cost of the source is just as important as the cleanliness of operation when it comes to overall carbon footprint contribution.

208,These Adidas shoes are biodegradable,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/17/adidas/,2016/11/17,"
These Adidas kicks are woven from Biosteel fiber, a material designed to replicate spider silk that was developed by a German biotech company. The material is lighter than other synthetic materials and is quite strong. It’s also, perhaps most notably, 100 percent naturally biodegradable.

Fittingly unveiled at the BIOFABRICATE conference held at Parsons School of Design in Manhattan, the concept shoes were born out of the same drive toward increased sustainability that recently gave birth to the limited edition Parley shoes, which were created using 95 percent ocean waste. That line was limited to 7,000 shoes in its first run, with a larger run version arriving next year.

VP James Carnes took to the stage at the event to outline the company’s partnership with Munich-based biotech company AMSilk, the latest entry in Adidas’s forward-looking Futurecraft line. The shoes, while still prototypes, are an attempt to reach the next level of sustainability, moving beyond recycled material to a human-created material that can go back into the Earth.

“In Germany, the idea of organic food is a bit of a mystery, so the idea of being environmentally friends and sustainable is also natural,” the executive told the crowd. “We thought we needed to do something that has a great impact on the world.”
The material is a sort of biomimicry inspired by spider silk. The Biosteel yarn is created using natural carbon sources that are fermented and converted into a white powder. It’s already been rolled out in a number of forms for medical serves like implants and surgical meshes and has been utilized for beauty products. The company’s third division is focused on textiles, which is where Adidas comes in.

The spider-inspired fabric is 100 percent biodegradable and bio-sourced. And, unlike other materials used in shoe production (see: leather), it’s completely vegan. After the presentation, the company pulled the curtain back to reveal the shoes with a bit of theatrical flair. The sneakers retain a similar aesthetic as their predecessors in the Futurecraft line.
The protein-based Biosteel yarn forms a knitted top — a beige color, in the case of the shoes on display — that’s met at the bottom by large textured white soles. The material itself is hard to distinguish from other synthetic yarns at first glance and touch. It’s flexible and has a good amount of give, which should make for a decent running shoe, particularly when coupled with its tensile strength and breathability offered by the porous structure.

The shoes will be available at some point in 2017. No word on pricing, but we’ll likely see a rollout similar to the one Adidas put in place with Parley, offering them up at a pricey limited edition, with a more mainstream version arriving later. They will be produced at the Speed Factories the company has been opening in the U.S. and Europe.

209,Shareholders approve Tesla acquisition of SolarCity,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/17/shareholders-approve-tesla-acquisition-of-solarcity/,2016/11/17,"
Tesla and SolarCity leapt an important hurdle Thursday: getting shareholder sign off for the proposed acquisition of the latter by the former. Respective shareholder votes at both companies signaled a green light for Tesla’s plan to take over the solar energy technology provider, which Elon Musk first proposed in June. Even minus Musk and “other affiliated shareholders,” Tesla shareholders voted 85 percent in favor of the deal, and Tesla expects the transaction to close “in the coming days.”
Sign-off from shareholders was essentially the last big barrier to the deal, which aims to bring together a company Elon Musk leads as CEO with one founded by his cousins where he acts as Chairman of the Board. Already, Tesla has been treating the companies as essentially unified, with an event last month that highlighted a new glass solar tile that was co-presented by Tesla and SolarCity execs, but treated mostly as though it were the product of a single, encompassing Tesla.
In addition to the event, which included a reveal of the solar tiles along with Tesla’s new and improved Powerwall 2 home energy storage solution, Tesla put out a blog post at the beginning of November articulating the reasoning behind the combination of the two companies. Basically, as Musk has repeated many times, Tesla’s interest is in building an “integrated sustainable energy company,” which covers every step from energy creation, to storage and ultimately to consumption and transportation, too.
Tesla also expects SolarCity to actually contribute positively to its cash balance, adding over $500 million to Tesla’s balance sheet across the next three years. Meanwhile, it says Tesla itself is in its best financial shape ever, putting it in a good position to execute on the acquisition.
The tie-up between the two company’s is driven by a vision Musk maintains of a unified sustainable energy stack, and Tesla also sees it as an opportunity to promote adoption of SolarCity’s products more broadly via Tesla’s existing global relationships with loan providers, which can help finance installation of new consumer solar setups, in more places than SolarCity currently operates.
Musk also anticipates a future where the market for the Powerwall and other home storage batteries far outstrips demand for Tesla vehicles, including in areas that are underserved or hard to reach for traditional grid-based power providers. A side benefit of the union could be cross-over “halo” brand effect for both companies, where satisfied customers of one become new clients for the other.

210,"Hyundai partners with WaiveCar for free, ad-supported EV car sharing",https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/16/hyundai-partners-with-waivecar-for-free-ad-supported-ev-car-sharing/,2016/11/16,"
Every automaker seems to be partnering up for car sharing, and Hyundai is no exception. The carmaker is teaming up with WaiveCar, a startup offering ad-supported car sharing with a pilot program currently operating in Santa Monica. The team-up will see Hyundai’s first EV, the IONIQ, incorporated into WaiveCar’s fleet, beginning in LA.
Hyundai is offering the IONIQ to WaiveCar users for up to two hours per trip on-demand for free, with ads displayed on the car’s body and on a roof-mounted display as a way to recoup the costs of driving for WaiveCar. WaiveCar’s top-taunted displays have their own built-in 4G data connection, and change the advertising they show to onlookers based on where the car is traveling and the time of day. After the initial two-hour period, the car can be kept for an additional $5.99 per hour, or returned to a designated WaiveCar drop-off point.
For Hyundai, it’s a double-dip marketing campaign: the cars display IONIQ advertising, and they also offer drivers a chance to take one for a spin totally free of charge, with fewer restrictions and more real-world use opportunity than if they’d come into a dealership for a test drive. To start, Hyundai is deploying 150 cars for use with WaiveCar, with availability beginning in early 2017.
It’s a smart partnership for Hyundai and WaiveCar both, as it gives the former a car-sharing partner with a unique model that’s a great fit for promoting its EV strategy, and the latter a steady inventory supply with vehicles that are less expensive to maintain than fuel-based cars. Show-rooming vehicles (giving users a chance to see what ownership would be like) is part of every automaker’s strategy with car-sharing services and partnerships, but this one, given the market and the EV angle, seems particularly apt.

211,"Phononic raises a cool $40 million to make quiet, spacious refrigerators",https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/16/phononic-raises-a-cool-40-million-to-make-quiet-spacious-refrigerators/,2016/11/16,"
Refrigeration and air conditioning used to require vapor compressors, chemicals like Freon, fans, water chillers or passive heat sinks. But a North Carolina company called Phononic has developed solid-state refrigeration technology instead.
Phononic, which employs about 110 full-time today, just raised an additional $40 million in equity funding to rapidly expand manufacturing of its semiconductors and refrigerators, as well as sales and marketing efforts in the U.S. and China.
CEO and founder Tony Atti, a former research scientist with the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said:
“We want to push the limits of how small, thin and high heat pump-able our devices can be, which would benefit almost any hardware or industry you can think of from autonomous vehicles and EV batteries, to air conditioning and commercial refrigeration.”
The company began selling its first products, including quiet, vibration-free refrigerators, to the pharmacy, healthcare and life sciences industry. It has more recently expanded to telecommunications media technology.
Its chips are now used in the fiber lines that bring cable, voice or internet services to the home and office. Specifically, Phononic semiconductors cools photonic nodes that generate and transmit data across these lines.
Atti explained, “The main impediment you fight when you’re trying to maintain a 100 gigabyte data rate is heat.”
Besides hiring in sales, marketing and client support, Phononic plans to use its new funding for manufacturing, research and product development.
Atti claims that Phononic’s technology can already make 30 percent more storage capacity available in a refrigerator to store more inventory versus traditional systems, one reason hospitals and laboratories like units powered by Phononic.
He also said Phononic-enabled refrigerators are silent, don’t vibrate or rattle, consume less energy, and require less maintenance than traditional models. That’s all thanks to fewer moving parts and the absence of liquid, which erodes those parts, Atti explained.
Phononic is poised to build refrigerators and refrigerated kiosks for use in commercial kitchens, cafeterias and restaurants, next.
It’s notable that the company was able to raise such a significant amount of funding in the run up to an election. Including the $40 million extension, its Series E round amounts to $71 million.
GGV’s Jenny Lee, who sits on the board of directors at Phononic, said:
“Core technology disruption is a multi-year occurrence. Investors in this sector take a long-term approach to investments and are less affected by political climate. For Phononic, what was most important was that the technology works. They have working products which are already being adopted in the market, i.e. market validation.”
Investors in the extension round included UBS’ wealth management businesses, GGV Capital, Lookout Capital, Eastwood Capital Corp, Venrock, Oak Investment Partners, Tsing Capital, Huaneng Invesco WLRoss, Wellcome Trust and Rex Healthcare Ventures, according to a company statement.
 
Correction: Phononic’s latest round of funding was classified as Series E. An earlier version of this story called it a Series C round.

Water treatment is a massively pressing issue. Hundreds of thousands of people die each ear from lack of clean water and a small, portable filtration system could have saved them. That’s what Waterologies is trying to build.
Their products, the Solardistech 0.5, 15 and 4, are standalone water purifiers that use the power of the sun to produce up to a 1,000 liters per hour of clean water. The system uses a chlorine generator to purify water on consumption and a skimmer keeps the nasty stuff out of the potable water. All of the models are designed to allow you to connect to a source and just pull water out as needed and all are solar-powered.
Further, none of the machines need chemicals or reagents, as the entire system is self-contained. There are also water-quality sensors built in.
I saw these systems at the iWater conference in Barcelona and, although the website isn’t very polished, they looked to be quite workable. The company is also working on a backpack-based device for water purification.
Clean water is incredibly important and it’s cool to see a standalone product that can provide it without hydraulic or electrical infrastructure.

Jaguar’s showing off the I-PACE, an electric concept SUV that it’s aiming to bring to production sometime in 2018. The I-PACE looks like a sensible small utility vehicle, with a five-door design and performance-tuned features including a target 0-60mph time of “around” four seconds, a 310+ mile range and a 50kW DC charging mechanism that helps it reclaim 80 percent of its total range capability from zero in just 90 minutes.
The I-PACE looks similar in dimensions to the Tesla Model X, with a broad rear-end designed for max boot space tapering to a slim and sleek rounded front. The idea was to make a car designed for sport-loving drivers, with a low, road-hugging cockpit and yet with tons of usable space for those in the family way.
I don’t understand why car companies can’t name their all-electric concepts without invoking all-caps, dashes or isolated letters, but the I-PACE does look like an intriguing machines, especially if it actually makes it to production in 2018. Besides the exterior design, which I think succeeds in being attractive as well as properly engineered for electric efficiency, I also like the cockpit concept, which uses two large touch screens combines with a digital instrument cluster display to create what Jaguar called a “flightdeck” for the driver.

The full length glass roof is also signature futuristic indulgence, which is not to say it’s unwelcome, but ultimately it’s a mighty nice looking vehicle in large part because it’s such a departure from Jaguar’s existing lineup in terms of design language.
Concept cars are still only that, of course, and a lot can happen between conception and production, but Jaguar definitely looks to be rolling in the right direction with its all-electric debut.

214,Tesla to charge new owners for Supercharger use after around 1K miles,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/07/tesla-to-charge-new-owners-for-supercharger-use-after-around-1k-miles/,2016/11/07,"
Tesla’s network of Superchargers have so far offered free, unlimited use to drivers of Tesla vehicles, but that was never going to last forever. Tesla announced upcoming changes to the Supercharger program today, which will introduce a fee for owners who purchase their vehicle after January 1, 2017 – but only if they exceed 400 kWh of charging in a year, which translates to roughly 1,000 miles of driving.
Once that threshold is passed, Tesla owners will begin being charged an incremental fee depending on usage, but one that will still undershoot the price of filling up a fuel-based car’s gas tank. As mentioned, orders until January 1, 2017 and existing owners and orders aren’t affected – they still get free Supercharging for the life of their vehicle, provided they take delivery before April 1, 2017.
Tesla says the change is about adjusting the economics of Supercharging in a way that “allows us to reinvest in the network, accelerate its growth,” but also notes that while they will begin charging customers after a certain point, the “Supercharger Network will never be a profit center,” which implies all funds generated will go to maintenance and expansion/improvement of the resource for drivers.
The timelines for the changes to come into effect mean that any Model 3 owners will have the capped Supercharging plan, and Tesla isn’t yet revealing the specifics of its usage-based pricing. That effective 1,000 mile cap means that the needs of many, many drivers will be met before they hit that Supercharge limit, however, since this really only impacts those using their cars for trips outside the car’s considerable range when they don’t have time or inclination to stop and charge at a normal rate.
Tesla also says it’ll release further details of how the pricing for charging beyond 400 kWh will work later this year, but also notes that these details may vary over time and by region, depending on the price of electricity and other factors.
We always knew the unlimited free Supercharger program couldn’t last forever. At least legacy Tesla owners will at least be able to find some comfort over not getting hardware needed for self-driving in their cars with the knowledge that they can at least use Superchargers indefinitely.

215,What Tesla’s new Gigafactory means for electric vehicles,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/06/what-teslas-new-gigafactory-means-for-electric-vehicles/,2016/11/06,"




Jussi Pikkarainen
Contributor


Jussi Pikkarainen is marketing project manager for Skeleton Technologies, a pioneer in the ultracapacitor energy storage industry.


Tesla‘s new Gigafactory opened at the end of July in Nevada, with much excitement from both the media and the general public. Only 14 percent of the massive structure has been built, with the rest of the $5 billion project to be concluded by 2020. According to Tesla, battery cell production will start in 2017; by 2018, the Gigafactory should be cranking out cars to the tune of 500,000 Model 3s per year. A big part of Tesla’s need to build the Gigafactory lies in the reduced expenses for lithium-ion battery production it provides.
The Gigafactory is a marvel of modern production technology, “a machine that builds machines,” as Tesla CEO Elon Musk puts it. In addition to being cool, it offers unprecedented economies of scale for lithium-ion battery production, lowering the price from $190 per kWh in April 2016 to an estimated $130 per kWh once complete. The huge scale of the production, coupled with reduction of waste and a vastly reduced supply chain, provide significant savings and ultimately a 30 percent reduction in battery production costs.
The Gigafactory is a big statement from Musk, and a clear sign that Tesla believes the world is ready for full electrics. But does the world agree? Are lithium-ion batteries the way to go? The total number of cars sold in 2015 was around 72.37 million. Electric vehicles accounted for around 0.8 percent, or 540,000, of that number, a significant step up from about 376,000 EVs sold in 2014, but still less than 1 percent of cars sold worldwide.
As far as Tesla goes, the company sold 50,580 vehicles in 2015, 0.07 percent of all cars sold globally, less than 10 percent of all electric vehicle sales. So, Tesla is winning the publicity battle, but so far it’s the big, traditional car manufacturers such as Renault-Nissan that are winning the zero emissions war. Nissan-Renault, the manufacturer of Nissan LEAF, the most-sold EV in the world, and a slew of other electric vehicles, sold 100,000 EVs between August 2015 and August 2016.
So for now, Tesla has gone all-in for lithium-ion batteries. What other options are there? Brands such as Ford, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Toyota — essentially all the big players on the market — are working mostly on hybrids in addition to their traditional lines of cars. To understand the benefits and downsides of each type of car, let’s first take a closer look at the electric and hybrid vehicles on the market today.
From Prius to Model X
Electric and hybrid cars can be divided into four main groups: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) and Fuel-Cell Electric Vehicles. Each have their advantages and disadvantages, but what’s certain is that each type is a more environmentally friendly choice than a conventional, fossil fuel-powered combustion engine vehicle.
Battery Electric Vehicle (BEVs)
Battery electric cars rely only on the battery pack to power the engine, which means the range is generally fairly limited. The one exception currently is Tesla; their Model S has reached a range of around 270 miles or 430 kilometers — although the numbers Tesla provides must be taken with a grain of salt, because the range depends largely on the size of battery pack you choose, how fast you drive, how cold or warm the weather is, whether you are using air conditioning or not, etc.
As mentioned, no other car manufacturers build only BEVs, but many companies are offering them in addition to their plug-in hybrids and traditional gas- or diesel-powered cars. In addition to Tesla, the best-known examples are the i3 from BMW, the Chevrolet Spark EV, the Mitsubishi i-MiEV and the Nissan LEAF.
The Gigafactory is a big statement from Musk, and a clear sign that Tesla believes the world is ready for full electrics. 
The biggest problem BEVs have is the lack of charging stations, and the time it takes to fully charge the battery pack. Tesla is working on building their Supercharger network to solve the issue, but other car brands are currently not able to use the Supercharger network. Of course, the lack of range only becomes an issue when you need to travel longer distances than a typical daily commute to work and back.
Another hurdle that BEVs need to cross is the high price of purchase. Once again, this is something Tesla is looking to remedy, and a large number of potential buyers are eagerly awaiting the launch of Model 3. However, the Model 3, Tesla’s lowest-priced EV starting at $35 000, is still not an inexpensive car by any means.
Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)
Plug-in hybrids have a conventional gas- or diesel-powered engine in addition to a battery pack. Hybrids are popular because they combine long range and low fuel consumption. PHEVs can be recharged from an outlet and the battery pack can be used for short distances. Once the power runs out, they can be recharged, or the driver can rely on the engine to keep driving. PHEVs are, of course, not as environmentally friendly as full EVs or fuel-cell EVs, but pollute significantly less than traditional cars. BMW i8, Chevy Volt, Toyota Prius Plug-in and Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV are some well-known examples of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles on the market today.
Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs)
Conventional hybrids with gas-powered engines and electric motors are actually not considered “electric vehicles” and cannot be recharged from the power grid. They are powered entirely by a gasoline engine and regenerative braking. The best-known examples of HEVs are Toyota Prius, the first truly successful hybrid, Honda Civic Hybrid, Toyota Camry Hybrid and Ford Escape Hybrid.
Fuel-Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs)
The last option for the green-thinking consumer is the fuel-cell powered FCEV class. Fuel-Cell Electric Vehicles usually operate by converting hydrogen gas into electricity to power an electric motor. The conversion process of hydrogen gas to electricity produces only water and heat, which means the FCEV class is the only class of EVs together with BEVs that can be classified as zero-emissions vehicles.
There’s one major difference between FCEV and BEV vehicles, though, and that is the Achilles’ heel of BEVs: lack of range. FCEVs rival modern gas engines in range and fueling is just as easy, with about five minutes needed to fill the fuel cell.
So why are there not more FCEVs on the road today? The technology is relative new, which means the biggest problem is lack of fueling infrastructure and, of course, as vehicle production numbers are currently low, the price per unit is high. Of the few FCEVs currently on the market, the Hyundai Tucson FCEV is only available for lease, and prices for the most-sold FCEV to date, Toyota Mirai, start at around $58,000. There are also many problems associated with the production and storage of hydrogen, which we’ll dig into a bit later.
What’s holding back electric vehicles?
To give you an idea of the timescales in which the car industry works, consider this: Toyota started development on its FCEV technology in 1992 and started selling the Toyota Mirai in 2015. That’s 23 years. It’s very common for car models to reach an age of 7-8 years before getting a facelift, which might just mean minor changes to the design of the car and possibly some upgrades under the hood.
Now let’s compare that to Tesla. Founded in 2003, Tesla brought its first car, the Roadster, on the market in 2008. Musk has later admitted that the Roadster “was completely unsafe,” it “broke down all the time,” and it “didn’t really work.” Nonetheless, to bring a new car model to the market five years after the company was founded is impressive. Eight years removed from the launch of the Roadster, Tesla has the Model S and the Model X, with Model 3 a few years away.
In the time most car manufacturers make mostly cosmetic changes to existing models that are based on old, proven technology, Tesla brought to market completely new car models with highly complicated, often unproven technology. Without Tesla lighting a fire under the backsides of the more traditional car companies, it’s very likely that electric cars would experience a slower introduction to the market.
Fossil fuels possess energy density capabilities far beyond what batteries can achieve.
But the Tesla engineers can’t solve all the problems of the electric car industry by themselves.
Let’s turn our attention to energy storage, an undervalued industry. There is a lot of talk about renewable energy production, but energy storage is sort of an afterthought to many. If you have ever wondered why renewable energy is not more prevalent despite us possessing the technology to power the world with it, the reason is energy storage.
Wind and sunlight are inherently unstable sources of energy, because the sun doesn’t shine 24 hours a day, nor does the wind howl away at an endless, steady pace. Energy storage devices are needed to balance the times of highs and lows. The small, incremental improvements in battery technology over the last 267 years — since Benjamin Franklin first coined the term “battery” to describe a set of linked capacitors he was using — have not been enough to keep up with the ever-growing global need for energy storage.
The same logic that applies to our homes, factories and shopping centers applies to our cars. Fossil fuels possess energy density capabilities far beyond what batteries can achieve, which means that despite their well-documented drawbacks concerning the environment, gasoline-powered cars will not disappear until energy storage catches up.
For a typical consumer, the jump from a combustion engine to a full electric, or even a hybrid, is a big leap. Even with constant upgrades and advancements in battery technology, lithium-ion batteries are heavy and suffer from capacity deterioration, leading to EV owners having to change the battery packs in their Teslas, or other electric vehicles, within 5-10 years. By Tesla’s own admission, the battery pack capacity starts deteriorating latest at 4-5 years of use, and by the 8th year, the battery pack capacity is expected to have decreased by 30 percent. With range being the top concern for most buyers, that’s cause for worry, especially with the price of a battery pack replacement hovering currently at a minimum of $12,000, according to Tesla, although the talk on the Tesla Motors Club forums circles at much higher numbers: from $25,000-$45,000.
The prices for EVs will decrease as the technologies involved become mainstream and economies of scale come into play with higher production numbers, so the problem we are left with is range. Extending the range requires one of two things: adding more batteries, which makes the car much heavier, or a rapid acceleration in the energy storage capability of lithium-ion batteries.
Adding more batteries is hardly an ideal solution, but can we expect big increases in lithium-ion battery capacity? Current lithium-ion batteries hold more than twice the amount of energy compared to the first Sony-manufactured lithium-ion batteries introduced to the market in 1991. If a doubled capacity in 25 years of constant research is the best the smartest people on the planet can achieve, it’s not realistic to expect huge increases. In fact, the consensus among the research community is that at most a 30 percent increase in energy by weight is possible for lithium-ion batteries. What that means is that lithium-ion batteries will never be the solution electric vehicles need to dethrone the internal combustion engine.
Without Tesla lighting a fire under the backsides of the more traditional car companies, it’s very likely that electric cars would experience a slower introduction to the market.
Knowing that, why in the world would Tesla put all its figurative eggs in the lithium-ion basket? Because lithium-ion batteries are currently the most cost-effective solution to furthering Elon Musk’s Master Plan, Part Deux, the key word being “currently.”
Therefore, Tesla’s gung-ho approach to lithium-ion batteries should not be taken as a statement on the future of electric vehicle energy storage. Tesla is an early adopter, and even more often the inventor of new technologies, and will surely adopt any advantage in energy storage they deem viable enough to improve on the current designs, regardless of the investment made into lithium-ion batteries. Musk himself has predicted that ultracapacitors, not batteries, will be the breakthrough for electric vehicles.
What’s preventing Tesla from using ultracapacitors? Ultracapacitors, or supercapacitors as they are also known, have several advantages over batteries, the incumbent energy storage technology. Ultracapacitors charge and discharge in seconds, have a lifetime up to 500 times that of lithium-ion batteries and are highly reliable. Sounds perfect, right? Well, not quite. Energy density, the one crack in the ultracapacitor armor, is keeping them off car manufacturers’ short list of potential replacements for lithium-ion batteries. They’re perfect for powering start-stop and Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems, but alone they’re not the answer.
The future of electric vehicles
Sooner or later, the reign of lithium-ion batteries will come to an end, because the inherent limitations of lithium-ion batteries mean that better alternatives must emerge. If we circle back to the four types of electric vehicles discussed earlier, only one does not rely on battery technology: the Fuel-Cell Electric Vehicle.
Hydrogen, the fuel used in FCEVs, is an extremely plentiful element, and when pure hydrogen is derived from renewable energy sources, the entire chain of energy production and consumption is free from carbon emissions. There is a group of devoted FCEV believers within the automotive industry; Toyota is perhaps the most enthusiastic among them. Toyota and Honda have been feverishly working on their FCEV models, with the Toyota Mirai and the Honda Clarity both already on the market, to get a head start on other manufacturers, but the competition is getting its act together. Lexus and Audi both debuted their hydrogen concept cars, the LF-LC and the h-tron quattro respectively, at the Detroit Auto Show in January.

At the outset, hydrogen looks like a promising alternative to fuel the future of transportation, but what does Elon Musk think? When asked to comment on FCEVs while visiting the Automotive World News Congress in Detroit in 2015, Musk was, true to his nature, quite direct in his appraisal, calling FCEVs “incredibly dumb.” Musk is not alone in his scathing criticism. Robert Zubrin, the author of Energy Victory, was quoted in the Economist as saying hydrogen is “just about the worst possible vehicle fuel.”
The disdain is easier to understand if we look at the two biggest problems FCEVs face: the production and delivery of large quantities of hydrogen. It’s currently very costly to produce hydrogen, especially carbon-free, and transferring it is equally expensive. Not to mention that the electricity needed to produce hydrogen could be directly used to power electric vehicles already on the market. It’s looking increasingly likely that FCEVs, despite not relying on batteries, are not the answer.
Where are we headed, then? We can already produce the utopian dream of an electric car enthusiast: a zero-emissions electric vehicle that uses a combination of ultracapacitors and batteries. Batteries provide the range, ultracaps the power and regenerative energy — it’s a perfect marriage of slow and fast energy storage. Is it perfect as a car? Not even close. It’s pricey, and either extremely heavy with longish range, or just heavier than an average car, but with a very limited range. In some years, lithium-ion batteries will hit a wall, and we’ll need an alternative energy storage technology. Whether it’s ultracapacitors, hydrogen, methanol, a combination of existing technologies or something completely different, it remains to be seen.
The sad thing is that Tesla is currently the only car manufacturer with the courage (take note Apple) to push the boundaries and make things happen, while other manufacturers seem to be content at developing hybrids and conducting small-scale tests hoping for a miracle. And what makes that even more baffling is that even though Tesla is the one manufacturer making huge investments on the Gigafactory and lithium-ion battery production, if and when the times comes for another technology to overtake batteries, Elon Musk will be there, ready to pounce. Until then, we’re stuck with Tesla. I can live with that — for now.

216,Arcadia Power launches a solar energy service for renters across the U.S.,https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/03/arcadia-power-launches-a-solar-energy-service-for-renters-across-the-u-s/,2016/11/03,"
The renewable energy services company Arcadia Power has just launched a new product that allows renters across the U.S. to buy renewable energy.
It’s a significant step forward for the renewable energy project developer and operator, which had previously integrated with utilities as an offset provider and load management company. And it’s potentially a game changer for the renewable energy movement.
I’m going to unpack that a bit because it gets a mite confusing. Before this announcement, Arcadia was offering services that would offset customers’ energy use with an equal investment in a renewable energy project (typically a wind farm).
Now, because of the company’s partnerships with utilities and status as a project developer, it has amassed a small group of projects through which it’s offering renewable energy investment to folks across the country who would want to install solar, but can’t.
Arcadia’s logic is simple. There are a number of renters or non-homeowners who would like to be able to invest in sustainable energy, but don’t have the means.

“That’s one of the most important parts of what we’re doing,” said Kiran Bhatraju, the chief executive of Arcadia Power. “The vast majority of Americans can’t do rooftop solar. There’s only about 8% of Americans that can.”
Those people are barred from such direct investments in a solar project because they live in multi-tenant houses, and can’t just throw up a solar panel anywhere they want.
Using Arcadia, these environmentally minded consumers can invest in projects across the United States and reap the benefits of that energy generation as if it were coming from their own home.
“We built technology over the last few years that allows us to push bill credits onto their utility bills,” said Bhatraju. “We can remotely connect you to a distributed generation asset. As that solar produces electricity we take the billed credits locally and that’s distributed onto the bill.”
Arcadia’s current projects aren’t huge, but they do prove that commercial customers and governments are buying into their thesis — if you offer renewable energy generation to renters — they will come.

The company posits that while there’s a will for renewable generation, consumers still don’t have a way that’s convenient enough for them to make the switch to solar power. Arcadia’s offering changes that.
So far, the Arcadia Power has projects in Washington, DC, Massachusetts and California. “We source the project and we work with the customers to get the buy-in into the program.”
For Bhatraju, the new offering is just the next step along the path that the company charted back in May when it raised $3.5 million from BoxGroup and Wonder Ventures.
When the financing was announced in August, Arcadia had 10,000 customers on its premium offer, matching customer usage with renewable energy at 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. The company also launched a free 50 percent wind option to people who wanted to split their bill between traditional utility power generation (typically coal and natural gas) and wind power.
The next product in the company’s pipeline is on-bill financing for energy-efficient products like smart thermostats and LED lighting, which Arcadia says can save customers between 10 percent and 30 percent of their annual energy costs.
Today, the company is rolling out its service with about 250 kilowatts worth of projects (enough energy to power roughly 41 homes, according to estimates by the Solar Energy Industries Association). According to Bhatraju, there’s another 2.5 megawatts of power in the pipeline.

The Obama Administration announced on Thursday that it will create 48 national charging corridors for electric vehicles, covering off 25,000 miles of U.S. highways running through 35 states. The initiative will include a partnership between 28 states, local utilities, EV charging companies and car makers GM, BMW and Nissan.
Reuters reports that the combination of stakeholders is designed to help “jump start” the addition of more EV charging stations into the mix, perhaps accelerating the pace beyond what any individual concern working along would be able to accomplish.
One company that has already been trying to blanket the country in accessible charging stations for electric vehicles is Tesla, which passed the 700 mark for Supercharger sites globally earlier this year. Tesla plans to expand the network even further across the U.S. this year, as you can see from its projected Supercharger location map current as of this writing:
Tesla’s projected Supercharger locations for the end of 2016.
In June, the White House announced the expansion of a federal loan program for promoting EV use to include hardware and software for charging facilities, with a max loan value of $4.5 billion total across the program for energy programs. At that time, the administration announced it was partnering with around 50 stakeholders, including automakers like Tesla, GM, Ford, Nissan, BMW, and Daimler to promote EV charging station creation.

218,Why Tesla’s new solar roof tiles and home battery are such a big deal,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/31/why-teslas-new-solar-roof-tiles-and-home-battery-are-such-a-big-deal/,2016/10/31,CONTENT ERROR
219,These are Tesla’s stunning new solar roof tiles for homes,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/28/these-are-teslas-stunning-new-solar-roof-tiles-for-homes/,2016/10/28,"
Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk wasn’t kidding when he said that the new Tesla solar roof product was better looking than an ordinary roof: the roofing replacement with solar energy gathering powers does indeed look great. It’s a far cry from the obvious and somewhat weird aftermarket panels you see applied to roofs after the fact today.
The solar roofing comes in four distinct styles that Tesla presented at the event, including “Textured Glass Tile,” “Slate Glass Tile,” “Tuscan Glass Tile, and “Smooth Glass Tile.” Each of these achieves a different aesthetic look, but all resembled fairly closely a current roofing material style. Each is also transparent to solar, but appears opaque when viewed from an angle.
The current versions of the tiles actually have a two percent loss on efficiency, so 98 percent of what you’d normally get from a traditional solar panel, according to Elon Musk. But the company is working with 3M on improved coatings that have the potential to possibly go above normal efficiency, since it could trap the light within, leading to it bouncing around and resulting in less energy loss overall before it’s fully diffused.
Of course, there’s the matter of price: Tesla’s roof cost less than the full cost of a roof and electricity will be competitive or better than the cost of a traditional roof combined with the cost of electricity from the grid, Musk said. Tesla declined to provide specific pricing at the moment, since it will depend on a number of factor including installation specifics on a per home basis.

Standard roofing materials do not provide fiscal benefit back to the homeowner post-installation, besides improving the cost of the home. Tesla’s product does that, by generating enough energy to fully power a household, with the power designed to be stored in the new Powerwall 2.0 battery units so that homeowners can keep a reserve in case of excess need.
The solar roof product should start to see installations by summer next year, and Tesla plans to start with one or two of its four tile options, then gradually expand the options over time. As they’re made from quartz glass, they should last way longer than an asphalt tile — at least two or three times the longevity, though Musk later said “they should last longer than the house”.

220,Tesla’s Powerwall 2 packs over twice the energy storage,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/28/teslas-powerwall-2-packs-over-twice-the-energy-storage/,2016/10/28,"
Tesla’s new Powerwall 2 is part of Tesla Energy, the company’s new comprehensive approach to green, all-electric power delivery. The updated home energy storage product is similar to the last one, in that it’s a large, rectangular (now with more rectangularity) device designed to live on a wall in your home (likely in the garage or somewhere similar) – but the big differences are on the inside.
The Powerwall 2.0 has more than twice the energy storage capacity of the original version with 14 kWh capacity. Over double the capacity means double the ability to keep your home humming with guilt-free electric power, culled from the new solar roof offering for private homes that Tesla also unveiled today. Musk said that the Powerwall 2 has enough power to charge lights, sockets and refrigerator for a standard 4 bedroom home for an entire day.
The new flatter design and more angular look, and will be available for $5,500 per unit. Improving supply for power storage has been one of Musk’s key goals with Tesla recently, and it’s clear it wants to do even more with Powerwall 2.
Production for Powerwall 2 begins in the next few weeks, and then installations will start in early December, according to Tesla.
In a Q&A following the event, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that they full “expect to sell more Powerwalls than cars,” since the product has so much appeal in parts of the world where power isn’t reliable, or widespread, or is very expensive.

And that’s it, folks! As rumored, today’s announcements were about a new Powerwall 2 (with 2x the capacity of the original) for $5,500, and a new line of solar panels that look a whole lot like standard roofing tiles while being efficient and durable.

Tesla is having a special event Friday at 5:30 PM PT, and the company is streaming the show live on its website. You can definitely expect to see a brand new solar roof product, as well as Powerwall 2.0, since Elon Musk himself has said those are the focus of the launch.


Solar roof plus Powerwall 2.0 launch event will be webcast live on https://t.co/46TXqRrsdr at 5:30pm PDT tomorrow
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 27, 2016



It’s common practice when Tesla has a launch event for it broadcasts the stream directly from its home page, so that’s your best bet for watching live while the solar roof first sees the light of day (get it?). And there will be light, because the start time of the event has been pushed up slightly to 5:30 PM PT to ensure there is:


Solar roof unveil now at 5:30pm sharp (need daylight, for obvious reasons) California time tomorrow.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 27, 2016



Tesla’s solar roof is going to be an actual roofing replacement material, rather than something you add to the roof after the fact. Musk envisions it being used by customers in new home builds, and in situations where an existing roof has reached the end of its life and needs a full replacement.
Previously, Musk talked about how this roof would be integrated not only with a second generation of Tesla’s Powerwall home energy storage battery, but also a Tesla vehicle charger, so that will likely also be part of the unveil. Taken together, it should present a fairly complete look at what Tesla wants to offer customers in terms of a whole-home energy solution, so check back on Tesla.com at 5:30 PM PT/8:30 PM ET to see what’s revealed, and of course we’ll have coverage of everything as it happens here on TechCrunch, too.

Tesla posted an appetizer of sorts for its event tomorrow, via a blog post that details Powerpack 2, the second iteration of Tesla’s commercial and utility energy storage solution. The Powerpack 2 actually started shipping quietly in September, with a brand new energy module on board that’s capable of achieving twice the energy density or around 200 kWh of storage.
Powerpack 2 also has a new inverter designed and built by Tesla, and this is, according to the company, the “highest efficiency and highest power density utility-scale inverter on the market,” and also has the benefit of being easier to install.
Tesla says it has delivered batteries adding up to over 300 MWh in total energy storage capacity, which is an impressive feat given that in the U.S., an average home consumes around 11 MWh per year.
Tesla revealing this little piece of news ahead of time indicates that it wants to make sure there’s plenty of time and attention left for the remainder of its announcements tomorrow, which will include the first look ever at its integrated solar roofing solution, and Powerwall 2.0, its second-generation home energy storage solution.
We’ll be there and bringing you the news live on October 28 starting afternoon Pacific time.

Marijuana is an ancient plant with borderline mystical properties — just ask the 266 million people who smoke it every year. Hemp, the industrial strain of Cannabis sativa, has been used for many purposes — food, fuel and textiles among them — for tens of thousands of years. Unlike its sister strain, hemp can’t get you high. But much like the drug, it has extraordinary qualities.
America is no stranger to hemp. In fact, Betsy Ross sewed the first American flag with hemp and George Washington farmed it at Mt. Vernon. Unfortunately, its full potential was never realized; drug restrictions that banned marijuana suppressed hemp, too. This spurious conflation quashed the industry for about 60 years, until a 2014 farm bill defined it as an agricultural crop, leaving the door ajar to American farmers.
As marijuana laws continue to loosen across the country — and the world — it looks like hemp could be brought back in a big way. With China leading in worldwide hemp production and Canada having capitalized on it during America’s drug war, now is the time to get in the game. In today’s fast-paced and tech-driven world, this means re-adopting the plant for today’s innovation economy.
Hemp could make a huge difference in everyday products, certainly. But even more exciting are the groundbreaking research and high-tech products it’s already spearheading.
Amazing properties
Before we launch into some of hemp’s cooler applications, it’s important to understand just what makes hemp so unique.
First and foremost, hemp is incredibly environmentally friendly. Instead of depleting the land’s nutrients, like cotton does, hemp actually puts nitrogen back into the soil. It takes less water, but produces more plants per acre (for reference, one acre of hemp produces four times the paper an acre of trees does.) Its low lignin content and natural brightness reduces the need for pulping and bleaching, meaning fewer chemicals are needed all around.
Hemp grows in a wide variety of soils and climates, so it can be harvested in all 50 states (though only about half legally). It’s one of the strongest plant fibers and is naturally resistant to weeds and pests. It harvests quickly, growing 10 to 20 feet in just four months.
Then you have hemp seeds, an incredible source of protein. More than 25 percent of their calories come from high-quality protein, considerably more than similar foods like chia seeds and flax seeds. Various studies have linked them to a reduction in risk of heart disease and easing of PMS and digestion.
As a form of sustainable agriculture, hemp farming holds enormous potential.
Hemp is also ideal for the production of ethanol, the cleanest-burning liquid bio-alternative to gasoline. Combustion releases water vapor and CO2, which plants absorb.
It’s no wonder hemp is called a smart plant, as it seems almost too good to be true, especially in a world rife with environmental and climate concerns. Considering farmers need the DEA’s approval before sowing seeds, there is still a barrier to entry — for now, anyway.
Future-forward applications
Restrictions aside, preliminary research has yielded results that only confirm hemp’s potential, and not just as an everyday alternative to cotton and wood, but for high-tech innovations.
Ever heard of graphene? Hemp fiber is also incredibly strong and light, and Dr. David Mitlin, a scientist from Clarkson University in New York, says his team has mimicked the nanomaterial’s amazing qualities using hemp waste. According to Dope Magazine:
Dr. Mitlin and his team were able to recycle leftover hemp-based fiber, cook it down and then dissolve it until carbon nanosheets that resembled the structure of graphene were left behind. They proceeded to build these nanosheets into powerful energy-storing supercapacitors with high energy density, thus creating a hemp based “graphene.”
The best part? This graphene-like hemp costs only a fraction of the price of traditional graphene: $500 a ton compared to $2,000 per gram. Dr. Mitlin also suspects the hemp-based product could outperform graphene.

Another amazing product is hempcrete, a concrete made with hemp and lime. For construction, hempcrete is essentially a super-concrete: Its negative CO2 footprint alleviates the greenhouse effect and improves air quality. Its natural insulation keeps homes warm or cool, reducing need for energy. Its resistance to cracks under high pressure makes it well-suited for earthquake-prone areas. It’s even mold, fire and termite proof.
Hemp also can be used to create bacteria-fighting fabrics. As early as the 1990s, scientists in China were developing blended hemp fabrics with superior resistance to staph in order to prevent sometimes fatal infections in hospitals. Considering at least two million Americans get staph infections when hospitalized, and 90,000 die, this could be a life-saving innovation here in the U.S.
Luckily, Colorado company EnviroTextiles is on it. The company’s hemp-rayon fabric blend has shown in preliminary studies to be 98.5 percent staph resistant and 65.1 percent pneumonia-free. In addition, EnviroTextiles offers hemp fabric resistant to UV and infrared wavelengths, ideal for military purposes.
What’s next?
These are just a few of the many high-tech and future-forward applications hemp has. As a form of sustainable agriculture, hemp farming holds enormous potential — for the planet, the economy, and even veterans seeking employment. Once the hemp is produced, it may not get you high, but figuratively, the sky’s the limit.
After all, how fitting is it for an ancient plant, used both 10,000 years ago and in early America, to continue its legacy in our modern world? Betsy’s hemp-based flag became a symbol for the country, which is now a leader in technological innovation. It would be foolish not to take the bull by the horns and ride it.

225,What to expect from the Tesla solar roof event on October 28,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/27/what-to-expect-from-the-tesla-solar-roof-event-on-october-28/,2016/10/27,"
Tesla is hosting an event this coming Friday in L.A., and it’s doing so in tandem with SolarCity. This will be a sort of preview of what we can expect from the companies once they combine into one under the Tesla umbrella, which should happen soon, provided investors are on board. We know that Tesla will show off a new roofing material with integrated solar panels, with an integrated Powerwall 2.0 home energy storage solution and Tesla charger, because Elon Musk told us so — but we don’t know what else we might see.
Solar roof
The solar roofing solution is something that Musk has discussed a number of times, including first during a SolarCity conference call and then on Twitter, and most recently during Tesla’s own earnings call on October 26. The big difference between this and past solar panel offerings from SolarCity is that these are designed to replace traditional roofing materials, not be added on after the fact. Musk has said that this means they expect it won’t appeal as a retrofit solution, but will instead appeal more to new builds or those due for rooftop replacement.
The roof image depicted in Tesla’s event invite.
On Tuesday’s Q3 Tesla earnings call, Musk said that he believes the solar roof material “looks better than a normal roof.” He teased that “you’ll be quite impressed by what we debut on Friday,” saying “it’s exceeded [his] expectations” and concluding that he “thinks it’s really great” before stopping himself from saying more in the interest of preserving the surprise.
Musk’s plan includes an initial goal of replacing some 5 million rooftops in the U.S. with Tesla’s solar-gathering alternative, and all of this is part of his “Master Plan,” which has always included “Provide solar power” as one of his goals. Part 2, revealed in July, includes this as one of four new goals.
Create stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage
Powerwall 2.0
That brings us to Powerwall 2.0, which is the battery storage portion of that equation. Tesla’s first Powerwall debuted in April 2015, and offered home storage for either 7 kWh or 10 kWh for $3,000 and $3,500, respectively.
Tesla’s original Powerwall.
The revision to Powerwall set to be unveiled at Friday’s event should be flatter than the previous edition, and shown and sold in Tesla stores, rather than exclusively via distributors, as reported by Electrek. The site has also previously reported that Tesla plans to double the storage capacity of the new version of the power pack, and produce them in greater volume.
If Tesla can increase capacity while keeping costs at or near level, that would be a terrific accomplishment and a big incentivizing factor to help expand sales to a broader group of potential customers. Storage is a key component of a self-sufficient solar electric power system for the home, and greater capacity also helps ensure your Tesla vehicle can take full advantage of the system, too.
Tesla charger
The new charger could be integrated directly into the Powerwall 2.0 as an option, which could help improve the speed of charging, depending on how it’s drawing and supplying current to the connected Tesla vehicle.
There’s also a possibility that it could then act as a virtual extension of the Powerwall, Electrek theorizes, feeding energy back into the grid in instances where it would do more good in your home than in your car, during a power outage for example.

Tesla has previously previewed a prototype charger that uses an articulating robotic arm to automatically find your Tesla’s charging port and plug in, but we haven’t heard much about that since the company showed a video of it in operation in August 2015. Musk recently tweeted that video, however, while discussing how a fully self-driving Tesla equipped with the company’s new sensor suite and on-board computer could drive itself across the U.S. on demand.

It would be great if the snake charger was part of the system unveiled at this event, but we don’t have any strong indication it will at this point.
This might be the best look we’ve ever had at what Elon Musk’s Master Plan looks like taken in totality, so it’s definitely worth checking out. TechCrunch will have live coverage of the event as it happens, so check back on October 28 for much more.

226,"SolarCity to offer Airbnb members up to $1,000 cash back on solar systems",https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/18/solarcity-to-offer-airbnb-members-up-to-1000-cash-back-on-solar-systems/,2016/10/18,"
SolarCity and Airbnb are teaming up to provide Airbnb members a discount when it comes to installing solar power generation systems on their own homes. Airbnb community members (including hosts and guests), will now be eligible to receive as much as $1,000 in cash back rebates on solar system installations, in all markets where SolarCity currently operates
SolarCity customers also get Airbnb benefits, in the form of a $100 travel credit for future bookings, and that applies to both existing SolarCity customers as well as new ones who sign up in the future. On a press call discussing the arrangement, Airbnb’s Head of Global Policy Chris Lehane explained that the team-up makes a lot of sense because both companies find that their customers place a high value on lowering their environmental footprint, and Airbnb customers in particular are looking for places to stay that take ecological concerns to heart.
“We are indeed that climate friendly travel option that we believe guests are looking for,” he said.
Airbnb already does a lot to offset the environmental impact of travel, Lehane said, noting that in the U.S. it has reduced water consumption by 4.2 billion litres vs. traditional accommodation options, and greenhouse gas reduction amounts to around as much as is generated by 560,000 cars on U.S. roads per year.
“The great majority of our customers go solar with absolutely no money out of pocket,” explained SolarCity President of Global Sales Toby Corey, explaining that the company looks for programs and partnerships that allow it to mitigate costs for potential customers. Since most of SolarCity’s customers opt for the zero money down financing plan for installations, the $1,000 credit will be applied to their payback, reducing the overall repayment period, Corey explained.
SolarCity operates in 19 states currently, which means Airbnb members in any of those U.S. markets can take advantage of the program. Corey also noted that SolarCity has almost 300,000 customers. He added that the Airbnb tie-up will help the company address the “millennial” market segment, which is one that he said it has only begun to explore, and one that represents a huge potential opportunity for the solar power company.

227,Judge dismisses riot charges against Democracy Now! cofounder Amy Goodman,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/17/judge-dismisses-riot-charges-against-democracy-now-cofounder-amy-goodman/,2016/10/17,"There may be hope for the First Amendment rights of new media journalists― a North Dakota judge has dismissed riot charges against Democracy Now! cofounder and investigative reporter Amy Goodman.
As TechCrunch reported this weekend, Goodman was charged for “participating in a riot” after she reported from the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota, on the long-running protests there against the development of a $3.8 billion energy project called the Dakota Access pipeline.
The pipeline specifically impacts the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in North Dakota and its 8,000-person reservation. Native American advocates say that the project will not only put safe drinking water at risk for the Standing Rock Sioux, but will also destroy their sacred burial grounds.
Goodman captured and broadcast footage of Dakota Access-affiliated security guards using pepper spray and attack dogs against Native American advocates and environmentalists.
Beyond matters of tribal rights, the pipeline raises profound ecological concerns.
Oil and petroleum pipeline spills have been on the rise in the U.S. since 2009, along with domestic oil consumption and production. The spills are caused by everything from corrosion, to welding or equipment failures, but also natural disasters and human errors.
Uncowed by the court, Democracy Now! has continued its reporting at the protest front lines.
Goodman is not the only journalist state prosecutors attempted to silence over pipeline protest coverage in North Dakota. A documentary filmmaker named Deia Schlosberg was taken into custody, and later released, but with her footage confiscated and still facing possible felony charges in the state.
She was arrested while filming demonstrators at the tar sands pipelines in Wallhala, North Dakota. The protestors shut down TransCanada’s Keystone pipeline there.
Charges against Schlosberg included “two Class A felony charges and one Class C felony charge, and conspiracy to theft of property, conspiracy to theft of services and conspiracy to tampering with or damaging a public service,” according to a blog post on EcoWatch written by Josh Fox.
Schlosberg was a producer for the Fox-directed documentary called How to Let Go of the World and Love All the Things Climate Can’t Change.
We have reached out to Schlosberg for an update on her situation.

229,Tesla and Panasonic will make solar cells in Buffalo if SolarCity deal succeeds,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/17/tesla-and-panasonic-will-make-solar-cells-in-buffalo-if-solarcity-deal-succeeds/,2016/10/17,"
Tesla and Panasonic have agreed to begin production of photovoltaic (PV) cells for use in solar power home installations that works with Tesla’s Powerwall and Powerpack solar storage products. The arrangement is non-binding at this stage, however, and will depend on the Tesla acquisition of SolarCity going through to take effect.
If the SolarCity/Tesla deal does close, Panasonic will start production of PV cells and modules for Tesla at a Buffalo facility in 2017, with Tesla saying it’ll make a long-term commitment to buy cells produced by the supplier. Panasonic is already Tesla’s partner for producing the batteries that power its vehicles, as well as those in its home energy storage solutions.
In a blog post, Tesla noted that the continued partnership between itself and Panasonic is an important piece of their larger goal of creating sustainable energy product for home use, and for doing so with the best costs possible.
Tesla and SolarCity’s leadership have both expressed their desire to unify the two companies under the Tesla brand. The proposed deal has seen some pushback, however, including from shareholders who filed a lawsuit opposing the union. Meanwhile, Tesla CEO and SolarCity board chairman Elon Musk is planning to reveal how a combined Tesla/SolarCity solar roof, power storage and vehicle charging solution will all work together at an event on October 28. Tesla and SolarCity shareholders will vote on the proposed acquisition on November 17.

"
230,Tesla and SolarCity shareholders to vote on proposed merger November 17,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/12/tesla-and-solarcity-shareholders-to-vote-on-proposed-merger-november-17/,2016/10/12,"
Despite some shareholder opposition, the Tesla acquisition of SolarCity proposed by Elon Musk continues to make progress, with a new date set for a vote of the shareholders of each company: November 17. That’s the date to mark in your calendars for a more firm go/no-go signal for the deal, which would see Musk move closer to his vision of a company that can manage clean energy from production all the way through down to consumption, with the goal of making that whole process attainable for everyday consumers.
A Tesla blog update notes the vote date, and reiterates the value the company sees in the union, as summed up in this paragraph:
[A] combined Tesla and SolarCity will be able to provide the first ever opportunity to generate, store and consume energy entirely sustainably, through a suite of integrated products that add aesthetics and function while reducing cost. By leveraging SolarCity’s installation network and Tesla’s global retail footprint, we can do this in a way that is seamless for our customers and that we expect will create significant value for our shareholders.
Between now and the vote date, Tesla and SolarCity will both have ample opportunity to make the case more strongly for a combination of the vision of the two companies; a Tesla/SolarCity joint event is planned for October 28, at which we’ll see SolarCity’s solar roof product debut for the first time, as well as the next-generation home energy storage device, the Powerwall 2.0. Tesla will also be offering financial details regarding the merge plan on November 1, the company says.
Tesla has faced opposition to the proposed acquisition of SolarCity, including in the form of a shareholder lawsuit that seeks to block the deal. Musk has been very vocal about the potential benefits of bringing the two together, however, and even recently tweeted that bringing on additional funding either via equity or debt-based raises isn’t going to be necessary for either in Q4. He also includes power generation as a key component of the second phase of his “Master Plan,” the end goal of which is to make transportation sustainable, and even revenue generating for Tesla vehicle owners.

231,BMW’s motorcycle concept is so smart you won’t need a helmet to ride it,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/12/bmws-motorcycle-concept-is-so-smart-you-wont-need-a-helmet-to-ride-it/,2016/10/12,"
Motorcycles aren’t exactly safe, but BMW envisions a future where two-wheel vehicles have enough onboard intelligence to make it possible for drivers to use them without protective clothing. The emphasis here is still on the thrill of the drive, but intelligent driver assistance features will help make it possible for the ride to maintain its thrill while adding a lot more safety.
The so-called Motorrad VISION NEXT 100 vehicle is one in a series of BMW concepts that aim to anticipate where its future vision is going, and how incorporating new technologies and connectivity features will change the driving experience.
With the Motorrad, the answer is less a path to full autonomy, as you might expect with four-wheeled cars, and instead represents a natural conclusion based on the aspects of motorcycle riding that people value. That means the end-user experience is more about the freedom of the open road, with issues like safety handled by on-board artificial intelligence systems.

The appeal of a motorbike you can ride without having to heap on layers of protective gear, including a huge cumbersome helmet, is indeed an amazing proposition. BMW says the Motorrad’s systems will anticipate the road ahead and offer drivers guidance on what to do to avoid incidents, and even step in and take over to prevent anything from happening if necessary. It also uses a self-balancing system that absolutely prevents the possibility of a tip-over, either when in motion or when standing still.
There is some headgear involved, even though the helmet is gone in the concept – it’s a lightweight visor, however, and it’s made to keep the wind out of your eyes but also to overlay important information on your view, including anticipated twists and turns. Powering everything is a zero-emission electric drive train.
Again, this is a concept so it’s far from being a real thing, but it is a very cool vision of what might be next for the motorcycle industry in a future where autonomy is king for cars.

232,National power grid carries data to smart appliances in UK experiment,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/11/national-power-grid-carries-data-to-smart-appliances-in-uk-experiment/,2016/10/11,"
Part of the goal of the Internet of Things, if we must continue calling it that, is improved efficiency for our newly intelligent appliances. But we could effect that in a much simpler way by passing data over the energy grid itself, suggests a successful trial in the UK.
It works by systematically modulating the 50Hz (it’d be 60Hz here in the US) signal that actually carries the electricity; previous attempts have piggybacked a high-frequency signal on the cables, but because of air gaps in transfer stations, that method was limited to local grids. This one can reach the whole country.
The signal transmitted is a simple one, carrying updates on peak times, energy prices, and regional use patterns. Once informed via the outlet, any device that’s smart enough can make minute adjustments: lower the thermostat by a degree, disable idle high-draw devices, and so on. It could even go the other way, activating A/C an hour early because prices are low.

Lots of small changes like this could smooth out energy demands, reducing peaks and the power plants required to supply those peaks — and which operate at a fraction of capacity at other times. More predictable usage would also make renewable power sources easier to deploy.
If the idea of the national energy concern whispering to every gadget in the country seems creepy, you’ll be glad to hear that privacy shouldn’t be a problem, because the transmissions are one-way. The specialized equipment that modulates the current can’t be fit into every washer and electric blanket, after all. So they would simply receive the information and decide on their own (or at your discretion) whether to adjust to the shifting energy landscape.
Reactive Technologies created the equipment and technique for propagating the data signal, and successfully demonstrated it by tapping into the national power grid all over the country to observe a signal propagating. The company expects its first (commercial) customers within a year and half, and with luck residential deployment should come after that.

233,Breakout Labs backs 4 startups that are “reprogramming nature”,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/11/breakout-labs-backs-four-startups-that-are-reprogramming-nature/,2016/10/11,"
A venture fund that backs very early-stage advanced tech and science startups, Breakout Labs, has invested in 4 new deals, according to founder and Managing Partner Lindy Fishburne.
The fund, which is part of the Thiel Foundation, typically invests $350,000 in each startup, with no strings attached. If a startup’s research and development does not lead to commercialization as hoped, Breakout Labs does not seek any money back, and counts the cash it has invested as a grant.
If a company succeeds enough to go on to raise outside venture capital, Breakout Labs’ earlier grant is exchanged for shares at a cost discount.
And if Breakout Labs companies are acquired or go public, generating returns for investors, the fund puts all of its returns into future grants for other advanced tech and science startups. Fishburne calls this approach “first mile,” funding.
Breakout Labs also pays for startup founders it has newly backed to travel to San Francisco for quarterly meetings with one another, and for its annual “Unboxing day,” where founders can show off their research, and network with potential strategic partners and venture investors.
Fishburne said if there’s one unifying theme among the companies it has backed to-date, it’s the idea of “reprogramming” nature. “We can reprogram, build and upcycle what we need from what already exists in nature, rather than passively relying on nature to deliver it to us,” Fishburne said.
Breakout Labs has invested in 30 companies so far in the fields of biotech, data and materials science, and energy. Seven of those companies have gone on to raise Series A and two have closed Series B rounds.
The four new startups that Breakout Labs has invested in are:


Azitra – The Farmington, Conn.-based startup is developing a “recombinant strain of skin-safe bacterium that secrete therapeutic proteins.” These proteins are missing from the skin’s microbiome when a person suffers from problems like eczema or a staph infection.



Opus 12 – Based in Berkeley, Calif. captures carbon emissions where this pollution is generated, and turns the CO2 into chemicals like methane, ethylene and ethanol, gases that are used to make plastics, surfactants, detergents and fuels that burn relatively clean, as compared to diesel and gasoline.



Seatrec – A spinout from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Caltech, this Pasadena, Calif.-based company is creating tech that could replace Lithium batteries in some cases. Specifically, Seatrec makes a battery packed with phase change materials. These expand and contract when temperatures around the battery change by about 10-degrees, creating high pressure which is then stored and used to drive an electric generator. Seatrec systems can power unmanned, underwater vehicles called floats and gliders, used for oceanographic research.



Zymochem – Another Berkeley, Calif.-startup, Zymochem is developing microbes and processes to turn sugar, and other renewable feedstock, into valuable chemicals without emitting greenhouse gases. The company aims to sustainably produce the chemicals that are required to manufacture apparel, automotive plastics and food packaging, which are made using petroleum today.

 
Corrections: This post was updated to correct typos, and to reflect the way that Breakout Labs’ grants work versus convertible note deals which are typical for very early stage startups.

Tesla will unveil something on Monday October 17, according CEO and founder Elon Musk. It’ll be a new product, he said in a Tweet on Sunday, which will be “unexpected by most,” and which will be separate from a Tesla/SolarCity product unveiling on the 28th.


Tesla product unveiling on the 17th (unexpected by most), followed by Tesla/SolarCity on the 28th
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 9, 2016



Musk previously teased the October 28 event, saying it would include the unveiling of joint products from both the electric car and the solar energy companies, including a solar roof, along with an integrated second generation of the Tesla Powerwall energy storage solution, and a Tesla EV charger.
The new information from Musk suggests Tesla will be revealing something new on top of all of the above. Some possibilities include a new vehicle (many have been looking for a Roadster 2.0 launch), or improvements to its autonomous driving features. The company recently launched its Autopilot 8.0 update, but Musk had suggested earlier in the year that the company is making progress on self-driving tech at a pace that might surprise most.
Following his tweet about the upcoming events, Musk also said that neither Tesla nor SolarCity will need to raise either additional equity or corporate debut in the fourth quarter, as some observers had suggested it might. It’s another sign that these events are likely designed at least in part to reassure investors that Musk’s proposed merger of the two companies is actually in the best interests of both.

The electric vehicle bandwagon has long left the station thanks to Tesla, but Maserati still wants to get on board. The high-end carmaker might be behind the curve when it comes to announcing its electric vehicle plans, but it’s looking like the Fiat-Chrysler-owned company will manage to ship a fully electric car by 2020, with something to show off in the 2019 timeframe.
The Maserati EV won’t be a Tesla Model S competitor, but will instead be more in the “grand-touring coupe” vein according to Car and Driver, which spoke to Maserati engineering lead Roberto Fedeli about the company’s EV plans at the Paris Motor show this past week.
Fedeli told the publication it’s well aware they’re late to the game, and will probably be “last” to market with a production electric car in the premium segment. But he also said this means they’ll have to deliver something “very different” from the offerings of competitors. He acknowledged that the carmaker has to think about what its brand means in the EV space, since signature Maserati trademarks like the sound of the engine and the lightness of the cars run at cross-purposes to EVs with whisper quiet motors and battery-laden heavy chassis.
It’s an interesting look at how established carmakers have to re-think their brands in light of the increased popularity and demand for electric cars, and how that might result in very different-looking offerings in terms of both tech and design, relative both to existing lineups and to the competition.

A startup that matches riders with drivers for paid and pre-scheduled carpooling, Scoop, has inked a deal with two big towns in the increasingly congested commuter hubs in the San Francisco Bay Area, Foster City and San Mateo.
With this deal, each city is subsidizing carpoolers’ rides so that passengers only have to pay $2 each way, and will ostensibly refrain from driving solo or taking taxis, which clog the roadways and can contribute to poor air quality.
Drivers see 50 percent to 100 percent of their expenses reimbursed through Scoop, generally, based on how many people ride with them. Before becoming a Scoop driver, a vehicle owner has to go through a motor vehicle history report ensuring they have a clean driving record.

The city-subsidized rides will kick in on October 10, but Scoop riders can begin booking their discounted carpool trips today.
As TechCrunch has previously reported, with Scoop, passengers book a ride in a car with an available seat as late as 9 p.m. the night before their commute. And they can book a ride home as late as 3:30 p.m. the day of the return trip.
The company is venture funded by Signia Venture Partners, Index Ventures, BMW i Ventures and Workday Ventures.
The company currently operates in the San Francisco Bay Area, and between Los Angeles and Century City.
According to co-founders (and brothers) Jon and Rob Sadow, Scoop has plans for national expansion, and hopes to partner with other city transit offices to encourage carpool usage, reduce traffic problems and, of course, grow the app’s user base.

Scoop works with large employers to subsidize their employees’ carpooling, too. Riders can specify whether or not they want to ride with a specific colleague or friend, or after they have taken a ride, whether they’d prefer not to ride with a particular driver or passenger again.
The company’s corporate partners have included Tesla, Cisco, Workday, Stanford Research Park companies, Salesforce and Applied Materials and Creative Artists Agency.
The company has recently surpassed 100,000 trips across eight towns in the San Francisco Bay Area and the Los Angeles metro area, Jon Sadow said. Each carpool takes an average of 1.5 riders, besides the driver, per car.
The company faces significant competition in the market for paid carpooling, not just from UberPOOL or Lyft Line, which tend to focus on shorter distances, but Google’s new Waze Rider service.

237,Fisker is back with a new electric car to debut later in 2017,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/04/fisker-is-back-with-a-new-electric-car-to-debut-later-in-2017/,2016/10/04,"
Henrik Fisker, designer of the Aston Martin V8 Vantage and Aston Martin DB9, is back with an electric car company called Fisker, Inc. – not to be confused with the old Fisker, which was acquired by Chinese auto parts giant Wanxiang and retooled as Karma Automotive. The new Fisker will also be making EVs, though, with an all-electric “spiritual successor” to the Fisker Karma to be unveiled sometime in the second half of 2017, Bloomberg reports.
The new Fisker has been quietly working on battery tech, searching for something that would lead to a “new paradigm,” Fisker told Bloomberg. So alongside the car company, Fisker, Inc. has a new battery division called Fisker Nanotech, too. The work coming out of Fisker Nanotech, and what it does differently from other EV battery makers, is not yet clear – Bloomberg notes that these won’t be conventional lithium-ion batteries, however, like the ones that power the Tesla Model S and Chevy Bolt, though they will still contain some lithium. The company does think they’ll deliver better range and overall charge life, however.
Claims for the unreleased new Fisker vehicle include a 400-mile plus driving range, which would easily be industry leading. It’s also said to have more interior space. Fisker’s plan after the launch of this first, premium vehicle is to follow it up with a mass-market car costing less than $40,000, but again with range that beats anyone else in that price group. The new company also hopes to become a key supplier of battery tech to other OEMs, which, if successful, could help it fund its own car projects.
Henrik Fisker worked on the original design of the Tesla Model S, before Tesla accused Fisker and partner Bernhard Koehler of stealing trade secrets while working for Tesla later used in the formation of the original Fisker Automotive.

238,"Obama, Leonardo DiCaprio and scientist Katharine Hayhoe talk climate change at SXSL",https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/03/obama-leonardo-dicaprio-and-scientist-katharine-hayhoe-talk-climate-change-at-sxsl/,2016/10/03,"
At an SXSL panel on Monday, President Obama, actor, environmentalist and philanthropist Leonardo DiCaprio and scientist Katharine Hayhoe discussed climate change and what we can possibly due to curb it.
Hayhoe, who is the director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University, and CEO of ATMOS Research & Consulting, helps organizations like airports and public water utilities assess the potential impacts of climate change on their infrastructure and plan accordingly.
Following the discussion, DiCaprio premiered his new documentary about climate change, Before the Flood, at the festival hosted on the White House lawn.
Besides his acting career, DiCaprio has long been an advocate and philanthropic donor to environmental causes, but of late, has also invested in for-profit, for-good cleantech ventures, including Rubicon Global, an on-demand waste management company; Diamond Foundry, makers of cultured diamonds; and Zuli.io, makers of a smart power outlet.
“If you do not believe in climate change you do not believe in science or facts or empirical truths and in my opinion should not be allowed to hold public office,” DiCaprio said, and thanked the president for recent efforts to protect marine environments.
The actor then asked the president to grade the global response to climate change so far. Obama said he was hopeful because India was expected to soon sign the Paris Agreement, but he urged greater action to combat carbon emissions. This week, he said, the United States would be negotiating with aviation companies to control their greenhouse gas emissions.
“We’re seeing climate changes at the more pessimistic end of the range that [was] anticipated by scientists. So we’re really in a race against time,” President Obama said.
DiCaprio then asked Hayhoe what are the most urgent threats to our modern-day civilization, and where the solutions lie.
“We think of poverty, hunger and disease and people dying today from preventable causes that nobody should be dying from in 2016,” Hayhoe said. “We think to ourselves climate change, we can deal with that later. We can no longer afford to deal with climate change later.”
We will not be able to fix issues around food and clean drinking water, disease and more without stemming the loss of environmental resources, she suggested.

 
DiCaprio then asked President Obama how to inspire businesses to help combat, rather than contribute to, pollution and climate change.
“Dirty fuel is cheap, because we’ve been doing it for a long time.” the President said. “We know how to burn coal to produce electricity and burn oil and burn gas,” and it is a hard habit to break, understandably, especially for people living in poor countries.
He suggested we’ll have to come up with new sources of energy that are both clean and cheap, which would involve research, investment, startups and innovators, but also time to ramp up new energy sources.
“The best way we can spur that kind of innovation is to create regulations that say ‘Figure it out, and if you don’t figure it out you’re going to face a penalty.’ Or we could create something like a carbon tax which gives an economic incentive for businesses to do this,” the president said, admitting the likelihood of a carbon tax was a long way away.
He also lauded earlier generations’ regulatory efforts, including the Clean Air Act, which forced businesses to change their behavior and impact a reduction to acid rain. “We fixed it,” he said, and was reverent about what he called “nature’s resiliency when we do the right thing.”
DiCaprio also asked Hayhoe what are the biggest misconceptions she hears about climate change.
“Any of us who pays attention to the weather we know we have cold and hot, dry and wet. Then you might say why does it matter if our weather is incredibly variable anyway? But…our heavy rainfalls are getting more extreme,” she said, and further debunked the idea that weather changes all the time anyway, so nothing is “wrong” with the climate.
She described a recent, observable “stretching” in weather patterns that leave dry places drier and hotter for a longer period of time than usual, and wet or cold places coping with snow and rain for longer than usual.

The president and Hayhoe both discussed the breakthroughs that have already come about in solar and wind technology, and even more disputed energy sources like nuclear power and natural gas from fracking.
“On average every year 200,000 people die from air pollution from burning fossil fuels,” in the U.S., Hayhoe said. “Air pollution alone gives us all the reason we need to shift toward clean energy, let alone climate change.”
DiCaprio asked, if we don’t take immediate action, “Will things get exponentially worse?”
President Obama said, “If we tap the brakes now, then we don’t go over the cliff. When you think about climate change there’s a big difference between the oceans rising three feet or ten feet. Three feet, it’s going to be expensive and inconvenient and disruptive….But it’s probably manageable. Three feet means you move the houses back a little bit from the beach. Ten feet means the beach doesn’t exist.”
He emphasized that this is for people living in the United States, environmental impacts in other parts of the world could cause far more profound problems, notably food insecurity, and waves of migration due to climate change, therefore conflicts over migration.
“All of which is to say that as hard as it is for us to start acting now to solve a problem that has not fully manifested itself yet, this is going to be a really important test for humanity and our political system,” the president said.

239,"How to feed the world with sensors, data and local production",https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/03/how-to-feed-the-world-with-sensors-data-and-local-production/,2016/10/03,"
Today, food and agriculture entrepreneurs took the stage at the White House lawn for SXSL 2016 to discuss the potential and limits of technology to feed a burgeoning world population. According to the most recent available estimates from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) 793 million people in the world do not have enough to eat today.
And with a global population expected to grow to 9 billion by 2050, the U.S Agency for International Development (US AID) expects that agricultural production will need to increase by at least 60% from current levels to serve our nutritional needs.
The founder of Food + Tech Connect — a media company that focuses its reporting and events on improving our global food systems — Danielle Gould, moderated the discussion.
Gould pointed out that in recent years, consumers have been driving big trends in food production and retail — they want more food that’s produced locally, organically, and with ingredients that are clearly listed by producers.
Retailers like CostCo, Whole Foods and Meijer are all selling local and organic food today, Gould noted. While consumer packaged goods juggernauts have lost billions in the past decade as consumers rejected their chemical-laden products, and flocked instead towards brands with more of a natural bent.
SXSL 2016 – Feeding the Future panelists (clockwise from top left): Will Allen, Caleb Harper, Danielle Gould, Nikiko Masumoto and Maria Rose Belding.
The founder of Growing Power Inc., Will Allen, said these trends are a good thing, and could encourage a more distributed and equitable approach to food production. But such consumer demands can only be met if the U.S. makes an investment in new agricultural infrastructure, Allen suggested.
Growing Power advocates for and teaches urban agriculture in order to bring nutritious, fresh foods and food-related jobs into neighborhoods that lack access to them otherwise.
Allen specifically spoke of indoor, greenhouse, hoop house, rooftop and wall farms, all built using technologies that can partially replace outdated methods that he said are depleting our soil and other environmental resources.
He lamented that large, outdoor farms, due to climate change and pollution, have become unsustainable, whether they’re raising fruit in tropical climes and shipping it to cold weather states, or cultivating fish in the oil-polluted waterways of Louisiana.
A peach farmer and author named Nikiko Masumoto, with Masumoto Family Farm, added that inspiration and inclusiveness should be part of the country’s investments in agriculture.
She and Allen both referenced the fact that the current generation of farmers are quickly aging and will soon be hoping to retire.
While she grew up in the industry, she said, farming has not held a public image as an inclusive industry, welcoming of women and men of different ages, races or sexual orientation.
Maria Rose Belding, a co-founder of MEANS database, spoke of accessibility of another kind.
“Access to good food can happen in low income communities, but good food is not a given. It is not available to everyone at a price that everybody can afford. It’s really important to recognize that even if we can advance [the production and distribution of] good food for people living above the poverty line, we have to also do it for people living below,” she said.
MEANS Database is a tech non-profit in the food recovery business. It works with groceries, restaurants, caterers and other food businesses that have excess inventory to adhere to state and federal health laws, but get that inventory to pantries and other organizations that can feed hungry people.
Rose Belding also said, “You should not have to pay to do the right thing,” in order to help feed the world.
A director for MIT’s Open Agriculture lab, Caleb Harper, said he agreed. Too often, discussions about hunger and climate change feel dire and hopeless, he said. He attributed part of that hopelessness to the fact that farmers have lost some of their communal power to corporate practices, namely companies staking out intellectual property claims around technologies that can help produce more or better foods.
Harper’s team of researchers and engineers are aiming to infuse some optimism into the industry, in several ways.
MIT Open Ag is teaching kids and techies about food, hoping to turn some of them into farmers. And they’re building a massive, open database of agricultural data, and agtech software, so that anyone who wants to get involved in feeding the world can do so without paying a lot to get started or keep a competitive edge.
Across the board, panelists said they were eager to see new technologies like sensors and chemical analysis give consumers great information about their food, and to see how an increasingly distributed food system — comprising rooftop, indoor, greenhouse and other farms — could begin to eradicate hunger and create new jobs in urban neighborhoods across the U.S.

240,Faraday Future partners with Chevy Bolt-supplier LG Chem on batteries,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/03/faraday-future-partners-with-chevy-bolt-supplier-lg-chem-on-batteries/,2016/10/03,"
How do you prove you’re serious about making electric cars? A partnership with one of the suppliers currently producing batteries at scale for shipping vehicles is a good start. Faraday Future announced such a union today, with a new agreement with LG Chem, the lithium-ion cell manufacturer that provides the powerhouses for vehicles including the Chevrolet Bolt EV.
The partnership accounted today will see LG Chem supply batteries for Faraday’s upcoming variable platform architecture (VPA), which is the company’s modular base platform technology that’s designed to be flexible enough to provide the powertrain basis for a range of different types of vehicles. The VPA is designed with cost efficiencies in mind, giving Faraday Future a basic platform to work with that can be extended using adjustable length rails, and equipped with different motor configurations on each axle in order to suit the needs of everything from high performance sports cars to sensible family SUVs.
LG Chem’s battery supply will also be integrated into the VPA platform, presumably allowing for modular battery configuration alongside with other components like wheelbase length.
California-based Faraday Future has revealed very little about its production vehicle plans thus far. It debuted an ambitious race-inspired sports concept, the FFZERO1, at CES in January 2015, and is funded in part by China’s LeEco, which is pursuing a number of routes toward becoming an electric carmaker in its own right. The company is also looking into producing a self-driving car, and a potential Model X competitor spotted in testing which could end up being its first production vehicle.

241,Chevrolet’s Colorado ZH2 fuel cell Army test truck is made for modular power,https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/03/chrevolets-colorado-zh2-fuel-cell-army-test-truck-is-made-for-modular-power/,2016/10/03,"
Chevrolet continues work on zero-emission hydrogen fuel cell tech, and it’s now providing a just-revealed Colorado ZH2 fuel cell vehicle to the U.S. Army for design, to find out if the unique advantages of fuel cell tech are viable in actual real-world military mission situations.
The ZH2 is a modified version of the Colorado midsize pickup Chevrolet produces for the consumer market, with a specially reinforced frame designed for all-terrain use. The car’s engine compartment has also been modified to accommodate its hydrogen fuel-cell based power train, which GM says offers unique advantages for military use.
The U.S. Army’s testing will be focused on evaluating the benefits of fuel-cell tech in a number of areas, including “near-silent operation,” “reduced acoustic and thermal signatures,” “high wheel torque at all speeds,” “low fuel consumption across operating range,” and “water by-product for field uses.”
In everyday terms, that basically means that the Army will be checking out how the use of fuel cells might make for quieter, cooler rides that are harder to detect via instrument and human observation, and that can climb and tow with greater ease thanks to the continuous use of high torque which is a key ingredient of its hydrogen-powered electric drive train.

The hydrogen cells used to power the test vehicle can also potentially be used to provide a power source for field equipment, and for encampments, which is definitely useful when in missions deep in territory otherwise devoid of human settlement. Plus, the byproduct produced by the fuel cells is water – a valuable commodity on extended, remote trips.
“One of the things we started testing about 10 years ago is this exportable power take-off,” explained GM Executive Director of Global Fuel Cell Activities Charlie Freese in an interview. “Whether you’re using the vehicle in a site where you have no access to plug-in power, or if you’re a camper, or if you’re in this military environment, the ability to export 25 kW continuous, or up to 50 kW at its peak, is a really great functionality that comes out of this fuel cell system.”
One of the longer-term benefits of the use of fuel cells in this context might be the flexibility of the power source, however – the very same fuel cell power system is being used in a trial with the U.S. Navy to power an unmanned submarine. Long-term, you could see the benefits of using a common power source to fuel any number of military vehicles across branches; swapping out units in the field would not only mean better economies of scale, but shared training across operational and support personnel, too.
“You can imagine when you’re supporting them in the field, and you have a deep cache of spare parts,” Freese explained. “I could be wrong, but I’m not so sure I could imagine taking the spare parts out of a Navy depot and immediately servicing an Army vehicle, but with this [fuel cell tech] you could actually do that.”
GM developed the Colorado ZH2 in partnership with the U.S. Army Tank automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center and the entire sprint from winning the contract to producing the concept unveiled today took less than a year.  Internal GM preparation of the vehicle will continue earl into next year, at which time it’ll be handed over to the Army for a full year of field trial.

242,Honest Co. is reformulating its soaps after ingredients controversy,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/30/honest-co-is-reformulating-its-soaps-after-ingredients-controversy/,2016/09/30,"
The consumer products startup founded by Jessica Alba, The Honest Co., on Friday told The Wall Street Journal that it plans to reformulate its dish soap, laundry detergent and other cleaners after an earlier controversy over their ingredients.
The Honest Co. markets its products as gentler, healthier and more environmentally sustainable than those of mainstream brands in the U.S.
However, reporters with The Wall Street Journal and a third-party testing laboratory earlier found that some products made by The Honest Co. contained ingredients that the company previously said it excluded, namely, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS).
While SLS is used in plenty of soaps and cleaners already, and is generally seen as safe, The Honest Co. claimed it wasn’t the healthiest option for consumers and was harsh.
The Honest Co. claimed, counter to the WSJ’s findings, that its own lab tests never detected SLS in its products. The five-year-old startup also said then that it used sodium coco sulfate not SLS. But SCS happens to be made with SLS commonly, so The Honest Co. remained under scrutiny and is even facing lawsuits over its labeling.
Recently, a deal in the works that could have seen Unilever acquire The Honest Co. for a price in the ballpark of $1 billion derailed at the last minute over pricing considerations, sources tell TechCrunch.
Instead Unilever agreed to acquire The Honest Co. predecessors, Seventh Generation Inc., for an estimated $600 million to $700 million in cash. (Seventh Generation and Unilever have not disclosed the financial terms of their deal.)
Sources involved in M&A dealmaking in the consumer goods industry are also telling TechCrunch it would be highly unlikely if Unilever were to acquire Honest Co. at this point.
But other titans in the field, such as Procter & Gamble, Clorox Co. and Johnson & Johnson, could potentially come courting. They are all rumored to have sniffed around the Santa Monica, Calif. startup already.
Honest Co. has raised $222 million in venture funding to date, and generates about $300 million in revenue annually. It sells its products direct to consumers online, as well as via its own pop-up shops and major retailers like Target, Costco and Whole Foods.
Honest Co. executives could  not be reached in time for comment. A company spokesperson sent this statement:

“The Honest Company is and always will be committed to progress and innovation across our expanding product portfolio. Our internal R&D team, led by Dr. Laurence Dryer, consistently works to innovate across our entire product line while adhering to The Honest Company’s uncompromising safety standards. 
As part of this process, we are continuing to work on a new breakthrough cleaning line, including dish care, laundry and household cleaners, utilizing an advanced sugar-based surfactant technology to further improve the efficacy of our products. We remain committed to our mission of helping people live happy, healthy lives and providing products that families everywhere can trust.”

243,Dozr raises $1.9 million to become an Airbnb for bulldozers and excavators,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/29/dozr-raises-1-9-million-to-become-an-airbnb-for-bulldozers-and-excavators/,2016/09/29,"
A startup called Dozr Inc. has raised CAN $2.5 million (or $1.9 million USD) in seed funding to help contractors rent heavy industrial equipment from other construction professionals who have it, but aren’t using it.
Based in Kitchener, Ontario Dozr’s marketplace lets builders rent equipment, like excavators, skidsteers or one day drones and industrial robotics, either alone, or with a licensed operator who can run it for the duration of a given job.
Dozr launched in 2015 and has already amassed more than 2,000 customers and listed more than $50 million worth of equipment on their marketplace.
Dozr’s seed investment was led solely by Fair Ventures, an investment and innovation unit within Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd.
Dozr’s app helps contractors find industrial equipment to rent from peers in the industry.
Among its businesses, Fairfax owns large insurance and reinsurance providers, including Federated Insurance, which actually sells insurance to heavy equipment owners via Dozr’s platform.
While focused on the Canadian market to-date, Dozr’s investors expect it will eventually expand into the U.S.
For the near-term, the company plans to use its seed funding to add new features to its platform, and hire employees across sales, marketing, product and engineering.
The company’s founders are family members with experience working in the construction business, together– brothers Kevin and Tim Forestell, and Erin Stephenson who is married to Kevin Forestell.
One feature Dozr plans to add to its site this year will allow users to upload a video when they list equipment for rent.
“With video Dozr will be able to show the condition of equipment as it leaves and as it comes back to a renter, or even how it is used when it’s on the job site,” Kevin Forestell said.
Dozr co-founders Tim Forestell, Erin Stephenson and Kevin Forestell.
Video appeals to contractors who can hear from different pings, creaks and squeaks how well-maintained a particular machine may be. Video also appeals to insurance providers, because it can help avoid confusion over who may be at fault in cases of damages or accidents involving rented equipment.
The company currently offers users a browser and mobile-optimized version of its marketplace, but will also develop native mobile apps, given their seed funding.
Fair Ventures’ Gerry McGuire said his company backed Dozr because it believes the sharing economy concept can work well for the construction market and heavy, industrial equipment.
Users of industrial equipment face a choice between purchasing expensive equipment or coming up short when they have a job to complete, the investor explained.
“Those who become purchasers in many cases.. face issues of idle equipment and excess capacity. Being able to match the demand of users who may be unable or unwilling to purchase the high-cost equipment with the excess capacity of those who have already purchased equipment makes sense,” he said.
In the U.S. Dozr faces competition from other VC-backed marketplaces for industrial equipment including Yard Club, Getable and EquipmentShare.
Dozr sees itself as differentiated from these marketplaces because it provides insurance directly to equipment owners with every rental, allows renters to book talent not just equipment, and because it has deep experience in markets with inclement weather.

244,Mercedes-Benz looks to the future with Generation EQ EV concept,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/29/mercedes-benz-looks-to-the-future-with-generation-eq-ev-concept/,2016/09/29,"
Mercedes-Benz is trying to play with your emotions with its new electric vehicle concept, debuted at the Paris Motor Show today. The “Generation EQ” it unveiled is a sporty SUV design, which is reminiscent of the Tesla Model X in its lines and overall look. It has a dual electric motor drive train, and a theoretical max range of around 310 miles, thanks to a scalable battery systems that maxes out at a total storage capacity of 300 kW.
You might know EQ as the acronym for emotional quotient, but for Mercedes, it stands for “Electric Intelligence,” though they’re fully aware of, and actively trying to invoke the emotional component, too. Mercedes explains in a press release about the vehicle’s unveiling that Generation EQ is the combination of its four-pillar mobility plan for the future, which focuses on connected, autonomous, shared and electric transportation methods.

As carmakers are wont to do, Mercedes-Benz gets pretty deep in the weeds in terms of flowery marketing language and aspirational visions of an idyllic future when describing the thinking behind the design. Cutting trough some of that crap, the basic takeaways are that the body design is supposed to look sporty, while also reducing drag for max power efficiency.
Inside, there’s a huge display for the driver,  plus seats and interior lighting that evoke nothing quite so much as Tron. Seat and internal structure design also look to be pared down with an eye to minimizing weight and maximizing effective use of the electric battery powerhouse. Like Volkswagen with its I.D. concept, Mercedes has decided to scrap the conventional wing mirrors in favor of cameras and displays integrated into the doors for views behind the car.

Also like VW, Mercedes is looking to use lights as a way to communicate with the driver, and with surroundings, starting with a welcome pattern that displays as the driver approaches. There’s also adaptive ambient lighting inside that the carmaker says will provided a “special feel-good atmosphere.”
Induction and wired charging options are both included, and Mercedes touts its own energy storage unit as a complement to owners with solar systems for keeping a power source handy. Driver assist features are powered by HERE maps, and data from on-board sensors. EQ also boasts  full complement of comms made to talk to smart city infrastructure and other vehicles, provided we can all get our stuff together enough to make that truly ubiquitous some day.
It’s probably a little too sci-fi for most, but I like the design of the EQ. But again, this is a concept vehicle – it likely won’t look like this if and when it ships as a production car. Still, it’s interesting to see where Mercedes believes transportation is heading, since if it truly believes in those four pillar concepts and pushing them forward, we’ll have a very different view of car ownership by the time the EQ hits the road.

At some point, it’ll probably be commonplace, but as of its 2017 model year, Smart will be the only big car brand that can truthfully claim to offer both an electric drive and a gas-powered option across all of its vehicle offerings. The Daimler-owned maker of pint-sized urban cars will offer an EV version of its Fortwo, Fortwo Cabrio and Forfour in 2017, and each one will use a brand new Smart Electric Drive platform, built by Mercedes-Benz in partnership with Renault-Nissan.
The electric versions of the Smart cars aren’t range monsters, but offer 99 miles per EP ratings via their 17.6 kWH capacity, which is more than enough for the average city-dweller’s daily commute. Plus, you can actually get a full charge in just about two-and-a-half hours, instead of the longer charge times required for big capacity batteries using standard voltage outlets.

Pricing is yet to come for the EV options, but the first car to arrive will be the Fortwo Electric Drive with a launch window of spring 2017, with the convertible version arriving later that summer. All of these EVs will be on display at the upcoming 2016 Paris Motor Show in October.

247,This new electric car is designed for a $37 weekly subscription service,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/22/this-new-electric-car-is-designed-for-a-37-weekly-subscription-service/,2016/09/22,"
Europe continues to test the waters of shared vehicle ownership models, and the Amber One is a car designed to help eliminate the huge amount of time our own vehicles currently spend idle. The all-electric concept has a 250-mile range on a single charge, a top speed of over 93 mph, and a 0 to 60 time of a respectable 7 seconds. But you can’t buy one – to gain access, you subscribe to a service at a cost of €33 (around $37 U.S.) per week, which will let you use any available Amber One nearby.
The car itself looks similar to another vehicle recently unveiled designed for shared use – Spiri’s first EV prototype, designed specifically to maximize value for its on-demand carpooling service. There’s a reason for the similarity, as both service models will benefit from having a lightweight, energy-efficient all-electric car that can manage frequent trips but also fit in easily on crowded European roadways.
Amber Mobility says the Amber One is also designed to be modular, so that it can be upgraded throughout its life, which should be prolonged because it doesn’t need to be scrapped entirely when new tech or improvements come along. It’s also designed as a connected car from the ground up, with tight integration across software and hardware, according to the company, which will help reduce overall operating costs. Plus, eventually, the plan is to build in semi- and full autonomous driving capabilities, which Amber says will reduce costs associated with accidents and damage.

Car ownership basically sucks for all involved, and as Lyft co-founder John Zimmer recently pointed out, individually owned cars sit idle up to 96 percent of the time, which is massively wasteful in terms of allocated space, infrastructure, expense and eventual waste generated. Amber Mobility’s model hopes to address that, while retaining the convenience factor with a “guarantee” that an Amber One will be available “within walking distance at any time” to users of its service.
The Amber One is set to enter production in 2018, with prototypes hitting the road next year. Service will initially kick off for corporate partners in limited pilots at the end of this year, but consumer rollout of the service is expected in 2018, beginning in Amber’s home turf of Eindhoven, the Netherlands.

248,BrightFarms raises $30.1 million to set up futuristic greenhouses across the U.S.,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/21/brightfarms-raises-30-1-million-to-set-up-futuristic-greenhouses-across-the-u-s/,2016/09/21,"
Agriculture tech startup BrightFarms has raised $30.1 million in Series C funding to bring its high-tech greenhouses, and fresh produce, across the U.S.
The company is on a mission to make all fresh fruit and vegetables locally, rather than require them to be hauled from long distances or imported from overseas before they are sold at groceries.
Taking a page from the playbook of solar power providers in the U.S., BrightFarms offers customers a long-term, fixed rate on the salad greens and tomatoes it grows in its greenhouses to grocers.
BrightFarms-raised produce.
The startup’s CEO Paul Lightfoot explained that after BrightFarms locks in a “produce purchasing agreement,” it raises funds from various sources including economic development programs and different banks or equity firms to build a new greenhouse.
In effect, a big chunk of the company’s cost of goods is already committed revenue before they open up a greenhouse’s doors and start growing.
The new round of funding was led by Catalyst Investors, and joined by BrightFarms earlier backers WP Global Partners and NGEN.
Catalyst’s Tyler Newton said his firm backed BrightFarms largely due to its business model innovation and ability to “out-execute” other food producers in the U.S.
Consumers definitely want to buy groceries made by local businesses, and to help support jobs that pay a local living wage in their own back yard. According to research by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, local food sales totaled $12 billion in 2014 and are expected to grow to $20 billion by 2019.
A BrightFarms greenhouse that grows tomatoes and salad greens.
“Where the seasons don’t cooperate, we just didn’t have the option to buy local before. So that feels good. But when you taste a tomato or some arugula from BrightFarms, and compare it to something that’s been shipped from out West, there is an obvious taste advantage, too. That’s what grocers want,” Newton said.
BrightFarms is going after a huge market that doesn’t have a lot of competition outside of the states of California and Arizona, today.
America’s farms contribute $177.2 billion, or about 1 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product each year according to the most recent available calculations also from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
And 90% of the salad greens consumed in the U.S. are produced in California and Arizona, then shipped across the country or exported out of it.
Other agriculture tech startups like AeroFarms or FreightFarms are building out indoor and container-based farms, in urban areas to meet rising consumer demands for locally-produced, and delicious fresh foods.
BrightFarms CEO Paul Lightfoot
But Lightfoot believes that his company’s greenhouses – which take advantage of natural sunlight, obviously—can prove more environmentally sustainable and cost-efficient than indoor farms, and produce more supply than container-based and rooftop farms.
He says that’s because BrightFarms controlled environment greenhouses don’t need to use as much electricity for grow lights and temperature controls as indoor farms. Both are significantly more water efficient than traditional farms, even those using precise irrigation systems.
So far, BrightFarms operates three greenhouses, each employing 25 full-time workers, in the greater Philadelphia, Washington D.C. and Chicago metro areas.
If drought conditions continue, Lightfoot said, the company could someday move into the “salad bowl” state of California, or other agricultural hubs, displacing traditional, and often water-intensive, farms.
But for now it will focus on metro areas where demand for fresh produce is high but there isn’t a lot of arable land or weather to support traditional farms.
BrightFarms’ customers and partners have so far included grocers like Kroger, Ahold USA, Wegmans and ShopRite.
Besides using the new Series C capital to build out additional greenhouses, Lightfoot says the company will explore new crops and is likely to start growing peppers and strawberries in the near future.

Funding for its first car is coming from Legend Holdings Corp., Yingda Capital Management Co. and China Minsheng Trust, according to the company.
LeEco’s big raise should help it accelerate its EV plans, which so far include the LeSEE, a concept sedan design intended to be completely autonomous. LeEco also has a partnership in place with U.S.-based Faraday Future.

250,Spiri’s prototype 200-mile EV is made for on-demand carpooling,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/20/spiris-prototype-200-mile-ev-is-made-for-on-demand-carpooling/,2016/09/20,"
Danish startup Spiri revealed their on-demand carpooling service in late August, and is now ready to show off its first prototype vehicle. The company decided to build its own all-electric car from the ground up, using an engineering team with talent from Aston Martin, Tesla and more, in order to arrive at a final product that best suits the needs of frequent, multi-passenger urban navigation.
Spiri stresses that this is still very much a prototype, with ex-Tesla VP and Spiri board member Peter Carlsson calling it “basically a lab on wheels” in a press release accompanying the unveiling. The idea is to tweak features including handling, interior cabin space, range and safety options through testing before deciding on what the final Spiri vehicle will look like once it hits roads in active use.

The current Spirit car design only weighs around 992 lbs., which is way less than the Tesla Model S starting at 4,597 lbs., or even the BMW i3 at 2,635 lbs. The startup achieved that weight by basically throwing out everything on a standard car that “add[s] zero value to a person’s daily commute and travel,” according to Spiri CEO Stefan Holm Nielsen in a statement. That means there aren’t any interior body panels, and around one-quarter of the total parts used in making a regular consumer car. There isn’t even any paint. Plus, the vehicle’s body is entirely made out of carbon fibre, a light but strong material commonly used by EV makers to shave off valuable ounces in service of efficiency.

Spiri does have a bit more tech on-board than your average car, however, since it’s constantly connected to the cloud in order to ensure the cars are monitored throughout their use for safety. Passengers are also registered via the Spiri app and matched with others using the startup’s algorithms to maximize the effectiveness and speed of its carpooling routes.
Spiri’s ultra-light EV will help it optimize service pricing to achieve user fees the company says will be similar to the cost of a bus ticket, along with its plan to use customers as drivers of the vehicles, giving them free access to the cars in exchange for their service. Eventually, Spiri says it’s eyeing vehicle automation as a way to eliminate the need for even that portion of its business model, but for now the company’s biggest hurdle remains getting quality, responsible and safe drivers behind the wheel while also relying on unpaid members of its general user group.
The startup aims to begin its service sometime in 2017 in a city in one of five launch countries, which include the UK, Germany, Denmark, Norway and Sweden.

251,"Chevrolet Bolt EV starts at $29,995 U.S. with federal tax credits",https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/19/chevrolet-bolt-ev-starts-at-29995-u-s-with-federal-tax-credits/,2016/09/19,"
Chevrolet’s new Bolt EV is a vehicle that Wired has dubbed “Tesla-walloping,” and its pricing seems like a direct shot at Tesla’s lineup, including the forthcoming Model 3, which is set to be the dedicated electric carmaker’s more “affordable” option. Chevrolet revealed specific pricing and trim details for the base model Bolt EV LT, which begins at $37,495 US and which drops to $29,995 with the maximum $7,500 federal government tax credit applied – just squeaking under the stated $30K post-credit ceiling Chevy has been touting for a while now.
The official price details are more or less just Chevrolet filling in the remaining digits for a $29,XXX.XX price-after-incentives we’d all generally come to expect, then, but we also now know what you get standard in that Bolt EV trim level in addition to an EPA-rated 238 mile range on a single charge (the Model 3’s base model range is currently set at 215 miles).
It also has a “Regen on Demand” steering wheel paddle, which is Chevy’s trademark tech for letting the driver slow the vehicle, and regenerate some battery power via friction at varying rates controllable right from the wheel. The regen paddle helps drivers looking to perfect a single pedal driving technique, which is possible in EVs like the Bolt where regenerative braking triggers as soon as you let your foot off the accelerator.

Other standard features on the Bolt EV’s LT trim include a rear-vision camera, a large 10.2-inch touchscreen for infotainment control and Michelin self-sealing tires to counter minor perforations. On the top trim package, dubbed the Bolt EV Premier (that does sound fancier), you get everything that’s in the LT plus leather, front and rear in-seat heating, a surround camera and an in-set backup camera display in the rearview mirror. The Bolt with Premier trim has an MSRP of $40,905.
On paper, both the Model 3 and the Bolt EV have advantages over the other – the Model 3 will be priced at $35,000 to start pre-incentives, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said, which represents a savings of $2,500 when compared to the Chevrolet. The Tesla will also have supercharger capabilities, which will mean faster fill-ups on the road. Tesla’s car will also manage 0-60 in six seconds or less, while the Bolt will do the same in under 6.5. Bolt has better range, however, and will probably have more interior space thanks to its hatchback design.
There’s one more thing about the Bolt that’s undeniably better than what the Model 3 can offer: it’s shipping date. Bolt EV goes on sale in “late 2016,” Chevrolet says, while the Model 3’s timeline has the first units going out in late 2017, with full production really only starting off in 2018.

252,Black female founder raises $7 million for renewable energy tech startup,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/19/black-female-founder-raises-7-million-for-renewable-energy-tech-startup/,2016/09/19,"
I’d like to tip my imaginary hat off to Jessica O. Matthews, the black female founder and CEO of renewable energy tech startup Uncharted Play. Her company just closed a $7 million Series A round led by the NIC Fund with participation from Kapor Capital, Magic Johnson Enterprises, BBG Ventures and Lingo Ventures.
With the new injection of funding, Uncharted Play plans to build out the team and better equip itself to support the partners the company is bringing on in the coming months. Uncharted Play’s mission is to spread awareness about global energy and clean power through technology and play.
The $7 million investment in Uncharted Play makes Matthews the 13th black female founder who has raised more than $1 million in outside investment. Earlier this month at Disrupt SF, Morgan DeBaun of Blavity said that she’s raised over $1 million in funding and is still actively raising. DeBaun was the 12th black female founder to raise over $1 million.

In the tech ecosystem, black female founders receive basically zero venture capital. Of the several thousand venture deals that went down from 2012 to 2014, less than 1 percent of them went to black women, according to a recent report by #ProjectDiane. And the black women who received outside funding on average only got $36,000, while the average seed deal size in February of this year was $4.5 million, according to CB Insights. At the time of the #ProjectDiane report, only 11 black female founders had raised more than $1 million in outside funding.
Uncharted Play’s first product, SOCCKET, is a soccer ball that doubles as a power generator. The SOCCKET uses the rotational energy that gets generated every time the ball rolls to produce three hours of light for every hour of play.

Uncharted Play’s second product is the PULSE, a jump rope that doubles as a light. Both the SOCCKET and PULSE are powered by MORE (motion-based, off-grid, renewable energy, Uncharted Play’s proprietary technology for micro-generator systems. Those systems can integrate into anything that moves, which is what transforms the product, like a soccer ball or a jump rope, into a source of off-grid power. Uncharted Play’s goal is to better utilize kinetic energy in order to complement or even replace other energy systems.
Uncharted Play’s business model entails partnering with product manufacturers across industries like consumer electronics and infrastructure to put the MORE technology inside the everyday products we use, like strollers, shopping carts and suitcases. The idea is that you could then use the energy produced by that product to charge your cell phone and other things.
“We not only aim to disrupt how energy is generated, but how it is consumed,” Matthews said. “We envision a world where people shift from a ‘hoard & save’ energy mentality to a ‘continuous and on­-demand’ energy experience.”

Tesla has said that its acquisition of SolarCity could be delayed because of shareholder lawsuits which have been filed to challenge the merger, according to an amended regulatory filing published by the SEC today spotted by Reuters.
The lawsuits include four filed in Delaware during the first half of September, which accuse Tesla and SolarCity board members of having violated their responsibilities toward stakeholders by going forward with the proposed merger plans.
While lawsuits from shareholders following major fiduciary decisions made by company boards that negatively affect stock price are nothing new, Tesla notes in the filing that these could have special impact on their timeline for the proposed merger because in one case at least, the plaintiff is seeking an injunction from the board preventing the merger from closing.

A startup called Rex Animal Health wants to protect livestock from illnesses that can quickly turn into epidemics, and help farmers breed animals with the healthiest and most attractive traits.
Today at Disrupt SF, Rex unveiled technology to help veterinarians provide clinical support at the point on the farm, and predict the genetic causes of problematic traits in their herds, and in the diseases effecting them.
According to CEO Amado Guloy, his company didn’t start out this way. The pet parent of a sick dog, he set out originally to build something like “Zocdoc for pets,” he said, to help people find and schedule appointments with veterinarians.
But as a chemist by training, and Techstars-backed entrepreneur, he soon saw a much larger market opportunity in bringing data analytics and genomics to the farm. The company pivoted in 2015.
Today, Rex Animal Health’s platform lets the people who raise cattle, pigs, chickens and any other animals in the food supply chain keep a digital record of their health issues, even converting notes on paper into digital data.

The platform tracks which animals experience symptoms, which animals suffered from a veterinarian-diagnosed health problem and when, as well as the treatment measures taken, outcomes and associated costs to the business.
Rex Animal Health standardizes the data to make comparisons and calculations easy.
The company also conducts genomic and phenotype analysis, and gives farmers “weather maps,” or epidemiological maps, showing which viruses, bacteria and other health problems are sweeping a region.
With these maps, the farmers and veterinarians who work with them can prioritize lab testing of their animals, and rule out or diagnose locally prevalent issues quickly.
Rex Animal Health founding employees.
Over time, the company will combine electronic health records of animals with genomic data about both animals and the pathogens effecting them.
“What we have is a genotype and phenotype database that nobody has built before, and that could help solve problems around disease transmission and sustainability in the global food supply,” Guloy said.
Data could also help pharmaceutical companies speed drug development to stop recently mutated viruses or bacteria effecting livestock. And it could influence animal husbandry.
If a bull consistently sires calves that wind up producing a lot of milk, for example, or a heifer and her offspring seem to never be affected by respiratory viruses, Rex Animal Health can use the data it’s amassed to track down the causal genes affiliated with these positive traits, the CEO explained.
Knowing which animals have illness resistance and yield good milk and meat would encourage breeding of both into a kind of super herd.
The company, which earlier raised bout $270,000 in seed money from Techstars and 500 Startups, is hoping to raise additional venture capital to expand its own genetic sequencing capability and hire more employees.
They are competing against other startups bringing genomics and data science to farms, including Metabiota and Trace Genomics.

255,This electric bus can handle a day’s worth of transit on one charge,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/12/this-electric-bus-can-handle-a-days-worth-of-transit-on-one-charge/,2016/09/12,"
Tesla topping the 300 mile per charge rating with its new 100 kWh battery was a big deal, but a new zero emission bus debuted today by Proterra has actually managed 600 miles out of a full battery in testing. In a real-world setting, Proterra’s new Catalyst E2 will probably manage somewhere between 194 and 350 miles in actual use settings – but that’s plenty according to the company, representing the full route needs for the average bus in the U.S.
That means that when the Catalyst E2 starts hitting city streets sometime in 2017, it’ll represent the first full-EV mass transit option that can actually stand in for existing gas-based vehicles without much in the way of compromise.
Proterra says in a press release that interest in its existing lineup is already on the rise, including a 220 percent rise in sales in 2016 vs 2015, and in order to meet the growing demand it’s going to double production starting in 2017. Part of that increased capacity will be focused on the new E2, which has a battery than can range between 440 and 660 kWH depending on configuration. That battery is actually the size of a mattress according to Wired, which is huge compared to the battery units found in Tesla and Chevy zero-emission cars.
All that extra capacity comes with a hefty price tag, too – around $800,000 just to start, which would potentially be a tough sell compared to a $300,000 or so price tag for a diesel-powered bus with the same passenger capacity. But that price is offset by subsidies in some cases, and there’s also the fact that it doesn’t have a maintenance-heavy internal combustion engine at the core of the powertrain, and it also doesn’t have fuel costs which will add to the savings over the lifetime of the bus on a rolling basis.
Proterra’s vehicles replace typical buses, making it more practical for short-term fleet replacement needs, but long-term, it’ll be interesting to see how these kinds of zero-emission solutions compete with things like smaller capacity shared commute services like Chariot, which Ford just acquired, and Tesla’s forthcoming plans to field fleets of multi-passenger electric vans as a transit alternative.

256,Phononic raises $30 million to rethink refrigeration,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/12/phononic-raises-30-million-to-rethink-refrigeration/,2016/09/12,"
A startup based in North Carolina’s Research Triangle Park, Phononic, wants to make refrigeration and temperature control far more efficient, and steadier, than is possible with traditional systems.
Instead of relying on vapor compressors, fans, chillers or passive heat sinks, Phononic makes semiconductors that are smaller than a dime, and actively remove heat from the places or devices where they are installed.
The company has raised $30 million in new equity funding to support the international expansion of its business, and ramp up the use of its tech within refrigeration and electronics.
CEO and founder Tony Atti said Phononics’ technology is both quieter and less energy intensive than other available systems. But customers are embracing it for cost-savings, not to look “green.”
“We can draw a line between a solid state, sustainable solution and something that has real economic value for our customers,” he said.
So far, Phononic chips have been used in wine chillers, medical refrigerators that are used to keep vaccines and biologics at a steady temp, and even in fiber-optic cables, which heat up undesirably as light and data travel through them.
Investors in Phononic’s new round of funding came from a mix of venture and public equity firms: GGV Capital, Lookout Capital, Eastwood Capital Corp, Venrock, Oak Investment Partners, Tsing Capital, Huaneng Invesco WLRoss, the Wellcome Trust and Rex Healthcare Ventures.
With their investments, GGV Capital’s Jenny Lee is joining the board at Phononic along with Bill Holland, Chairman of CI Financial.
Lee compared Phononic’s technology to LEDs, which transformed lighting and adjacent industries.
She wrote in an email to TechCrunch:
“For a disruptive technology to be adopted quickly, we think the approach is to work with the existing ecosystem and players and enable them to be successful versus trying to establish a complete, end-to-end new product, especially if you have a compelling price performance technology, which Phononic does.”
Given the new funding, Phononic plans to add at least 20 new hires to its sales and customer care departments over the next year, Atti said, and to build out its manufacturing and delivery capacity to serve a growing number of healthcare and life sciences customers, first in the U.S. and later in China.
The company employs 110 full-time today. It has established a factory in North Carolina already and some local operations in China.
Additionally, Atti said, the business will continue research and development efforts to make its chips even smaller. The CEO’s vision is to “decentralize the cold chain and climate control,” he said.
To translate that for laypersons, Phononic aims to bring its tiny cooling chips to every industry that requires temperature control to safeguard inventory and people.
A 6 oz. or smaller chip, like those made by Phononic, compare to a 22 oz. traditional, vapor compressor refrigeration unit. They can clear up space for inventory within refrigerated trucks, cargo ships and containers, or shelves on a refrigerator in a retail setting like a grocery store or restaurant.
If Phononics’ technology shrinks even further, it could be small and lightweight enough to keep everything from smartphones to drones at a steady, ideal temperature.

257,Toyota’s Prius Prime is engineered to give hybrid owners more EV feels,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/11/toyotas-prius-prime-is-engineered-to-give-hybrid-owners-more-ev-feels/,2016/09/11,"
Toyota’s Prius Prime is an updated take on the company’s popular hybrid, with more emphasis on the EV aspects of the vehicle, including a battery with double the driving capacity, and a few other tweaks that push the car closer toward the EV end of its dual identity, including an acceleration feature that lets the electric motor handle much of the pick-up when you first put your foot down.
Toyota first gave us a glimpse at the Prime at the New York Auto Show this March, but now it’s giving the vehicle its west coast debut at Disrupt SF ahead of the office full reveal, which is coming soon.
The Prius Prime’s tech bona fides lie both within the cockpit, and in the changes made to the overall body design and external components in order to help maximize efficiency for a hybrid with more electric boogaloo.

Some of those changes include redesigned lines for the body panels, which vehicle comms manager Nathan Kokes said were created in order to maximize the energy efficiency of the vehicle as much as possible. That means, according to Kokes, paying attention to how changes to the exterior impact aerodynamics at a micro level.
In addition to the panels for the car’s sides, this led to changes to the front grill, and a rear window that actually dips in the middle slightly to help air flow over and under the car in a way that creates as little drag as possible, which in turn leans to better battery life.
Inside, there’s a new 11-inch capacitive touchscreen panel that’s set into the dash vertically. It’s a very Tesla-like move and one that Kokes tells me Toyota has found resonates well with the Prius’ target demographic. Customers who care about the tech powering their car via the drivetrain and power source also put a high value on the tech available via the infotainment system, too.
Toyota plans to reveal the full range of trim options, pricing and availability details for Prime soon, as mentioned, but for now it does look like a potentially good option for that group of customers Kokes says it’s focused on with the Prius, who are curious about EVs but still want to keep a foot planted firmly in the traditional gas-powered car realm.

258,"BMW said to accelerate EV plans with 3 Series, X4 and Mini",https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/11/bmw-said-to-accelerate-ev-plans-with-3-series-x4-and-mini/,2016/09/11,"
BMW plans to accelerate its electric vehicle plans, in the wake of an executive shake-up and leading into a vote planned for the end of this month. The new BMW expanded electric lineup will kindle fully battery-powered versions of the Mini, the BMW 3 Series and the X4 SUV.
The company has previously discussed plans to electrify the 3 Series and other vehicles, but German’s Handelsblatt reports now that it’s picking up the pace on its EV strategy, in a bid to better compete with the likes of Tesla, whose Model 3 sedan has already amassed 400,000 pre-orders.
BMW’s current all-electric lineup is focused on the i3, a city-commuter oriented car that has a much more limited range than Tesla’s vehicles, including the forthcoming Model 3.
As mentioned, the renewed emphasis on EVs follows changes at the executive level, including a new CFO, and the merger of its marketing and sales divisions for Mini and BMW into a single organization.

259,Ford backs massive bike-share expansion in the San Francisco Bay Area,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/09/ford-backs-massive-bike-share-expansion-in-the-san-francisco-bay-area/,2016/09/09,"
At a press conference in San Francisco today, Ford Motor Co. president and CEO Mark Fields announced that the company had both acquired a rideshare startup called Chariot and made a significant investment in expanding the region’s bike-share program.
Ford’s sponsorship will see the Bay Area’s supply of shareable bikes expand from 700 to 7,000 by 2018, with 1,350 bikes going to the East Bay, and hundreds of new bike-share stations established to distribute the bikes.
The locations of the bike stations are still being determined, but these will be in and around Berkeley, Oakland and San Jose, not just in San Francisco.
The bike-share program is managed by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the Bay Area, and operated by a startup called Motivate, which also operates popular bike-share programs around the country, with their largest market in New York.
Motivate president and CEO Jay Walder said his company saw 10 million bike-share trips taken in New York in 2015, and that bike share would become part of the fabric of cities, increasingly. He did not offer projections for San Francisco bike-share usage.
In terms of technology, the bikes, now branded as the Ford GoBike, are not much to behold. They’re manufactured by Motivate and assembled domestically by Detroit Bikes.
They don’t include racks for cargo, a helmet or systems that would allow them to be parked or picked up anywhere. They’re more the sturdy, traditional bike-share bike with an electronic tracking and locking system.
In addition to ramping up the local, shareable bike supply, Ford will begin to show bike stations and available bikes within its Ford Pass app, said Fields.
Ford’s Pass app aims to be a single place where users can find available transportation or mobility options nearby whenever they need them.
Politicians and advocates — including San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee, Berkeley Mayor Tom Bates and San Jose Mayor and MTC Commissioner Sam Liccardo — showed up to ballyhoo the bike-share expansion and promote the idea that mobility options and transportation should be provided by not just public agencies but large, private sector partners.

260,Volkswagen and Anhui Jianghuai in talks on building EVs for China,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/07/volkswagen-and-anhui-jianghuai-in-talks-on-building-evs-for-china/,2016/09/07,"
China is looking at electric vehicles as a key way to lower emissions and improve the country’s general environmental sustainability, and Volkswagen is teaming up with China state-owned car maker Anhui Jianghuai (JAC) to help fill that need.
The two car companies signed a memorandum of understanding today, effectively paving the way for them to create a new joint venture to develop battery-powered EVs to serve the Chinese market. The new company’s activities would include R&D, manufacturing, sales and “mobility services” (which could include EV taxi fleet operation). The end goal is to create zero emission personal transportation options, but there’s no timeline currently for when those might start to make it to actual consumers.
Since this is just an MoU to explore the possibility of a more formal partnership, it makes sense that the two companies wouldn’t be discussing timelines. The new arrangement would also add a new Chinese manufacturing partner to Volkswagen’s existing roster, which includes SAIC and FAW.
Volkswagen could’ve partnered with one of its existing automaker affiliates in the country, but adding a new partner might help it accelerate the pace at which it can expand its EV offerings. The German company has said it wants to create over 30 pure EVs over the course of the next decade, and expanding its partners could help it get to that target.

261,Tesla brings its Design Studio to you with Model X SUVs towing Airstreams,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/07/tesla-brings-its-design-studio-to-you-with-model-x-suvs-towing-airstreams/,2016/09/07,"
Tesla may have a range of vehicle showrooms across North America, but those can’t cover everyone, and it’s even more difficult for the average potential Tesla buyer to get to the company’s primary design studio in Hawthorne, so the automaker’s new ‘Tesla Explores‘ initiative is aiming to bring a taste of the design studio to you.
The program is a road-trip across the continent, using six Airstream trailers outfitted as Tesla mobile Design Studios, each towed behind a Model X. The project has a number of announced locations for its initial stops, but the ultimate goal is to cover more broadly with new locations to be added based on customer input. Tesla is asking people interested in having one of the Design Studios visit to register their interest via a new website for the program.
Tesla continues to try to change laws in various states regarding direct selling, and its model remains illegal in a few states. These mobile showrooms might be a way to get around those restrictions, depending on what kind of sales process occurs in the portable showrooms themselves.

262,Missouri court rules against Tesla selling at its own dealerships in the state,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/07/missouri-court-rules-against-tesla-selling-at-its-own-dealerships-in-the-state/,2016/09/07,"
Tesla continues to try to up-end the dealership system in the U.S., which generally requires that franchise-owned dealers sell cars, vs. automakers selling directly via their own wholly owned dealerships. The latest beat in he ongoing battle comes in Missouri, where Cole County Circuit Court Judge Daniel Green decided in favor of the Missouri Automobile Dealers Association (via Autoblog), effectively deciding that while Tesla can own and maintain showrooms in the state via its state dealership licence, it can’t sell cars directly to consumers at those locations.
According to the terms of the judgement, Tesla can still sell its vehicles to Missourians online, and use its physical locations directly. This is the norm for most states where it’s allowed to sell its vehicles, but it’s still barred from selling its vehicles direct to consumers at all in six states.
The company continues to try to turn the state laws in its favor, but it faces strong resistance from powerful dealership lobbies across the country. Ultimately, Tesla wants to operate its own dealerships which can sell direct to customers, as well as selling online, and its argument for doing so is that generally speaking, franchisees don’t have sufficient expertise around EVs to sell them alongside other vehicles, and it also would clearly like to own more of the overall customer experience.
In Missouri, Tesla had attempted to argue that it could issue a franchise agreement to itself, an arrangement which would satisfy the local legal requirements. Judge Green says that the law requires the franchisee be a wholly separate entity, however.
Back in May, the Wall Street Journal reported that Tesla is still trying to convince lawmakers to change their minds about direct sales at the local level, but that it’s also considering mounting a federal case to challenge hold-outs based on a 2013 federal appeals court precedent involving the sale of coffins, wherein a coffin maker bypassed funeral directors in order to sell direct to consumers.

263,SolarCity’s integrated solar roof plan said to target 5M U.S. homes,https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/06/solarcitys-integrated-solar-roof-plan-said-to-target-5m-u-s-homes/,2016/09/06,"
How do you make a dent in the energy market? SolarCity is likely one of the few companies that has a good idea of how to answer that question, and one part of its plan includes replacing the roofs of 5 million U.S. homes with solar cells, according to The Guardian. It’s a plan that SolarCity board chairman Elon Musk first tipped on a conference call last month, but now we have a bit more specificity around scope.
The plan is not just to add solar capability to an existing roof, but to use roofing materials that actually integrate solar cells directly as a substitute for more traditional materials, such as tile or steel. The whole point of SolarCity’s approach is to lower some of the barriers to solar adoption for everyday homeowners, by creating a product that has a similar installation process and timeline when compared to traditional roofs, as well as a look that is not out-of-place or otherwise unattractive.
The Guardian reports that SolarCity wouldn’t comment on costs or other product details for the solar material, but price will likely be the key sticking point: The efforts of other companies to deliver similar products, including a Dow project launched in 2009 and finally discontinued this year, fell down because they were considerably more expensive than traditional roofs.
Businesses where Musk has a controlling interest have a proven track record of turning green tech efforts into viable consumer products where other companies have failed. But a 5 million household initial goal for SolarCity’s roofing plan means creating something that’s more accessible than the Tesla Model S, which still has only sold in the hundred thousand range since its introduction in 2012.
Still, there’s no timeline for the SolarCity goal reported by the Guardian, and we still haven’t seen the product or pricing. But SolarCity is also moving towards a merger with Tesla, which will allow it to much more easily offer customers a package that potentially includes home energy storage and a way to also power your car, all completely off-grid. The combined incentive, especially with a more affordable vehicle option thrown in via the Model 3, might prove a powerful motivator.

The US Department of Energy has awarded $8 million in Small Business Vouchers to 43 businesses, including ten projects aimed at making hydrogen fuel cells cheaper and more efficient, and six projects that will improve vehicle fuel efficiency, including better batteries.
In addition to funding from the DOE, participants in this second round of the SBV project will be working with 12 of the DOE’s national laboratories to accelerate the development of their technologies. For example, Nzyme2HC is paired with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to generate hydrogen for fuel cells using, among other things, industrial waste. The SBV award allows Nzyme2HC to prototype and test the cleaner — and potentially cheaper — hydrogen fuel at NREL.
Vehicle technologies range from improved computer modeling and simulations to fuel innovations. Saratoga Energy is developing a process to manufacture graphite from carbon dioxide to be used in lithium-ion batteries for EVs, while Sylvatex is designing a nanoparticle fuel system to reduce emissions and incorporate renewables in petroleum with assistance from the Argonne National Laboratory.
The SBV project isn’t just for vehicles and related technology; other awards were in the Bioenergy, Buildings, Geothermal, Solar, Water, and Wind categories. Round one of the project launched in March with 33 vouchers totaling $6.7 million awarded. To get a piece of that funding pie in a future round, visit the project’s website to apply.

266,"Uber turns on electric vehicles in the UK, starting with 50 cars in London",https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/31/uber-turns-on-electric-vehicles-in-uk-starting-with-50-cars-in-london/,2016/08/31,"
The race for who will take the lead in the next generation of automotive technology is on, and today Uber is kicking off a program that it hopes will help put it in pole position. Today, the transportation-on-demand behemoth is launching a new electric car service in the UK, in partnership with Nissan and China’s BYD, where it will offer leasing (not purchasing) options for fully-electric cars (BYD E6s and Nissan Leafs) to its drivers, as well as include those vehicles in the mix of cars that it offers to passengers for journeys.
“The cars through this partnership are for rent, not for purchase, and will be at rates lower than the cheapest rentals in the market for other private hire vehicles (in order to encourage drivers to make the switch from their existing vehicle),” a spokesperson from Uber tells us. “Obviously running costs are quite a bit lower too – although how much lower obviously depends what car they are switching from.”
Uber is starting first with 50 vehicles in London and — if all goes as planned — it will expand the service to another UK city in coming months, and projects to have “hundreds” of all-electric vehicles on the roads in the UK by next year.
Uber’s move to expand into electric cars is significant for a few reasons: for one, it builds on the company’s efforts to make sure that whatever direction cars may be moving in the years ahead, it will have a place at the table as one of the companies leading the charge.
Uber may not (yet) be fully using its own self-driving vehicles, which go hand-in-hand with self-driving cars in the next generation of automotive technology. But as a large company in the transportation industry, programs like this will help Uber have the ability to influence how these cars are made by third parties, and will also give it a good route into being a middle man in the leasing of these vehicles, potentially developing that business into a useful revenue stream to diversify from basic transportation (or delivery) on-demand services.
Moving into leasing services is a route that companies like Didi in China (which recently acquired/merged with Uber’s business in the country) and Ola in India have also taken in China to expand their businesses.
(Didi, as a side note, is also making further moves to expand its reach in another way: today the company announced that it would work with some 50 other transportation-on-demand businesses to provide a platform to help them organise and look for ride requests more efficiently. You can think of this as Didi’s equivalent to Amazon or Alibaba’s marketplace, where they are offering their transportation platform as a service to independent vendors.)
Second of all, it’s a smart move to improve Uber’s profile, both with lawmakers and regulators in the cities where it operates as well as with consumers and drivers, too. As a company with automotive transportation as its core building block, making investments into further electric car transportation and figuring out effective, alternative forms of fuel beyond gasoline to improve he environment, especially in large cities clogged with pollution (London, as an old city, has a lot of homes on very busy roads) are very obvious moves in Uber’s larger corporate social responsibility strategy, and also more directly to help improve its image, which has not always been positive.
Electric trends at Uber
The partnership being announced today plays on some earlier forays that Uber has made into adding electric vehicles into its fleet.
These include a trial that Uber started last year in Chicago, also with BYD, to offer electric cars as part of its UberX service, which offers rides in smaller, private-style vehicles for a lower cost than Uber’s higher-end tiers. An Uber spokesperson tells us that Uber is aiming the UK service at the same tier of users. We have asked how the Chicago trial is progressing and will update as we find out more.
There have been other electric car projects from Uber as well: they include a one-month trial earlier this year in South Africa, which has already ended. And in Portugal earlier this year, Uber also trialled an electric car service called Uber Green for three months. (Again, we’ve asked Uber for an update on these two as well.)
The difference with the UK project is that the cars will be part of the bigger mix of offerings, meaning as a passenger you might end up in an electric vehicle, or a Prius hybrid, or a more standard car.
Unlike some transport companies, such as Uber’s competitor in the UK, Addison Lee, Uber’s fleet is not owned by the company itself but comes as part of its deals with drivers to use its platform. That, essentially, gives Uber some flexibility in how it grows and a mandate to encourage and vet vehicles on the platform, but ultimately it must also rely on those drivers to have the initiative to upgrade. Uber says that some 60% of rides in London already take place in Prius-style hybrid cars.
“People already associate Uber with hybrid cars, but we now want to go a big step further with fully electric cars on the road from today,” said Jo Betram, the GM for Uber in the UK. “We are determined to use technology to help tackle the challenge of air pollution in London and across the UK. Our car-sharing service has already saved more than 1.3 million miles and 231 metric tonnes of CO2. With electric vehicles – and more people sharing their journey and leaving their own cars at home – there’s even more we can do.”
As with the other projects, Uber’s working with other groups to monitor the progress of its electric car service. The Energy Saving Trust (EST) will run a study “into the feasibility of running large numbers of electric private hire vehicles in the UK. In particular, the EST will research the experience, driving patterns and economics of private hire drivers using electric cars, and the capacity of London’s current network of charging points to support these vehicles.”
“We are delighted to be working with Uber to help realise and build upon their ambition to add a significant number of electric vehicles to their app,” said Andrew Benfield, Group Director of Transport at the Energy Saving Trust, in a statement. We hope that this trial represents an important step in Uber’s contribution towards the wider efforts to improve air quality in the capital – the benefits of which will be felt by all.”

267,More details on Audi’s Tesla Model S competitor emerge,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/30/more-details-on-audis-tesla-model-s-competitor-emerge/,2016/08/30,"
Audi’s upcoming four-door luxury electric car will have a 311-mile range, along with Level 4 self-driving features (essentially full autonomy, for those keeping track) and three separate electric motors, according to a new report from Autocar. The car is set to go head-to-head with the Model S, based on these new stats, and will likely be called the “A9 e-tron” when it goes on sale sometime in 2020, the publication says.
The range is in line with what Tesla says its new P100D option package will offer for Model S owners, though Autocar says that the Audi A9 e-tron will have a 95kWh battery to achieve that range, rather than the 100kWh version Tesla employs to get 315 miles as measured by EPA standards.
The powertrain for the upcoming vehicle is said to feature three electric motors that combined produce 429 brake horsepower (bhp), with a drive mode that can boost it to 496 bhp for short stints. Audi is looking at electric drivetrain tuning as one way where it will be able to offer a differentiating advantage to potential consumers.
Another option offered to potential A9 e-tron buyers will be a wireless inductive charging option, with a charge rate of 11kW (Plugless, an aftermarket option for Tesla Model S, offers a 7.2kW rate that provides about 20-25 miles of range per hour, for context). The option comes with an automated parking feature that will ensure the car positions itself correctly over a charging pad in an owner’s garage, Autocar says.
Audi has already announced that its A8 will get Level 3 automation next year, but Level 4 in a production car by 2020 is still an ambitious target (though one shared by a growing number of carmakers and tech companies worldwide). It’s also unlikely the Model S that this A9 e-tron competes with in 2020 will look like the Model S of today – Musk has hinted that a big leap in Tesla’s autonomous driving tech is on the way soon. Still, it sounds like Audi will be in the ring when the electric self-driving royal rumble goes down.

268,MIT makes pesticide safer by making it sticky,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/30/mit-makes-pesticide-safer-by-making-it-sticky/,2016/08/30,"
Despite progress in creating bug-resistant crops, pesticide is still one of the most effective and cost-efficient ways to ensure good produce yields. But the current approach actually involves applying a huge volume of pest-control poison – way more than you need, because just 2 percent or so attaches to the plants. The extra 98 percent has a good chance of getting into lakes, streams and groundwater, resulting in a lot of pollution. Not so with MIT’s new ‘sticky’ pesticide.
MIT researchers found that using just two cheap additives, they can reduce how much of the applied pesticide “bounces off” of plants, making for far more efficient spraying of crops, and far less total volume of pesticide needed to achieve the same effects. All of which means less pollution making its way to the water table.

It’s something researchers have tried to do before, using soap-like additives that actually only resulted in smaller droplets bouncing off the surface of plants, which are more easily spread around via the wind. The new method devised by the MIT research team uses two different polymer substances, each of which carries an opposite polarity of electric charge. When the positive- and negative-charged droplets come in contact on leaves of the plant in the sprayed crop, they result in a water-attracting combo that helps subsequent drops stick to the surface. It’s especially effective since most leaves tend to repel water, so turning them into water-attracting magnets is a complete reversal.
In terms of efficacy, the researchers anticipate that this could result in farmers using as little as one-tenth the pesticide volume they currently employ to get the same results. That’s based on lab testing; real-world trials are still needed to se how well it actually works, and there’s a plan to do just such a pilot in India soon.

269,Volkswagen’s 2019 electric car said to get 300 miles on a 15-minute charge,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/26/volkswagens-2019-electric-car-said-to-get-300-miles-on-a-15-minute-charge/,2016/08/26,"
This year’s Paris motor show will host the unveiling of Volkswagen’s first all-electric car, according to an interview with company chairman Herbert Diess in German magazine WirstschaftWoche. The car will be roughly Golf-sized, according to the chairman, but will feel as roomy as a Passat on the inside, thanks to space saved via lighter frame construction and use of the electric drivetrain. It’s on track for a launch in late 2018 or early 2019, which is in keeping with their earlier stated goal of delivering a range of EVs by 2020.
The highlight feature of this car might be the charging speed, however, which Autocar says will give it 300 miles of travel on just one, 15-minute charge. Even for electric vehicles with big batteries and lots of range, recharging time has been the key sticking point – Tesla’s supercharger stations will achieve an 80 percent charge in around 45 minutes, for instance.
A 15-minute time for 300 miles of range would be very impressive in a production vehicle. VW-owned Porsche claimed an 80 percent charge in 15 minutes for its Mission E Concept, unveiled last year, with a max range on a full charge of 310 miles. That speed requires an 800 volt charging rate, which is something Porsche is actively looking to build into charging infrastructure.
It’s unlikely that a 2019 VW all-electric will be able to take advantage of this kind of charging tech widely, given the charging infrastructure changed required, but it would still be a big statement from the car-maker to offer the spec in a shipping car. And since the Volkswagen group is still reeling from its emission scandal, any sizeable steps it can take in the EV market will ultimately do a lot to hep it recover its reputation.
In addition to the speedy charging capability, VW also says they’re aiming to field a vehicle that actually costs less than traditional fuel-burning cars. Volkswagen has electric versions of the Golf and Up, but this forthcoming car will be its first dedicated electric model.

270,Spiri’s on-demand carpooling service will use custom EVs and let drivers ride free,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/26/spiris-on-demand-carpooling-service-will-use-custom-evs-and-let-drivers-ride-free/,2016/08/26,"
Danish startup Spiri believes urban transportation is still massively inefficient, and it’s setting out to tackle the problem from a few different directions. First, it’s building an on-demand carpooling service, similar to the UberPOOL offering. Second, it’s going to use its own custom electric vehicles to do so. Finally, it’s using customers as drivers, in exchange for free rides. Service is currently set to begin in 2017.
Basically, that means the approach is a hybrid one that borrows aspects of what car sharing networks like car2go have done, with the on-demand taxi-style approach. The deal for drivers is that they can use Spiri’s fleet of cars free, provided they agree to pick up some passengers along the way and drop them off en-route to their destination. Passengers foot the cost of operation, paying what Spiri says will be costs in line with “public transport prices.” It’s working with Drivr, a dispatch and ridesharing platform provider, for the software side of the service.
Spiri’s most interesting aspect might be that it’s using its own cars. The vehicles are described as “ultra-light electric” ones. They’ll be multi-seaters, and the company claims 50 percent more energy efficiency as compared to the majority of electric cars on the road again, thanks to its use of lightweight materials. It’ll also boast “more legroom than a Mercedes S class limousine,” according to board member Peter Carlsson in a press release, who previously acted as Tesla’s VP of supply chain.
Exactly what said car will look like isn’t public, yet. When asked for further information, Spiri told me that the vehicle design “is all electric and bespoke built for city transport. This means it’s ultra lightweight. It’s sheds all excess car bling bling resulting in using only 25% parts of a normal car.” The entire thing has been designed in-house, Spiri says, as the startup “has been in stealth for more than year with engineers from Tesla, Aston Martin, BMW, DriveNow, Rimac and a lot more” working on the car.
Spiri tells me that hitting the roads with driver-controlled cars in 2017 is just step one, and step two will be putting self-driving Spiri prototype vehicles into testing later that same year.
The first glimpse of the car will be revealed at TechBBQ, a Danish tech conference happening September 20. Until then, people interested in signing up for the service can register today at Spiri.io. We’ll be sure to check out the final design of their vehicle, which based on the teaser does look interesting (panorama roof in a short-bodied frame?).

Faraday Future is driving a camouflaged version of a real upcoming production EV in LA, according to Electrek. The site reports that a candid shot of a covered-up SUV is actually a test vehicle from the Californian would-be Tesla competitor backed by Chinese consumer gadget company LeEco.
The vehicle looks like a crossover-style SUV, similar to a Tesla Model X, and this is in line with previous reports that Faraday was looking to field a $100,000-plus luxury sport utility crossover, which would essentially slot right into the market where the shipping Tesla car already plays.


There’s a new vehicle in LA 🌿👀🌿 pic.twitter.com/h21ZjCT3rg

The SUV would be its first production car, after the company unveiled a far less practical, but flashier FFZER01 concept at this year’s CES. The FFZER01 actually looks like something out of Nintendo’s F-Zero futuristic sci-fi racing game series, and has over 1,000 HP and a sub-three second 0-60 mph time – on paper.
The circus show that is Faraday’s concept EV racer is a far-cry from something you’d be able to use to get your groceries, which is why this test vehicle is so interesting. Faraday has a lot to prove in terms of stepping up as a viable EV company, after all.

273,All 44 startups that launched at Y Combinator S16 Demo Day 1,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/22/y-combinator-demo-day-summer-2016/,2016/08/22,"
Farm drones, autonomous security guards and next-generation tampons were among the products presented at today’s Y Combinator startup accelerator Summer 2016 Demo Day 1. You can check out write-ups of all 44 below. And here are TechCrunch’s picks for “The top 7 startups from YC Demo Day 1”, plus writeups of the 48 startups that launched on Demo Day 2
YC’s increased international outreach efforts are paying off. 30 percent of this batch’s startups came from outside the US. While some were mere copycats of US startups, many brought different approaches to classic problems.
YC president Sam Altman
Today’s startups were focused on consumer, developer tools, security, hardware, marketplaces, and non-profit. We’ll see a different set tomorrow concentrated around enterprise, B2B, biotech, edtech, and fintech.
Investors had mixed reactions, with few saying they saw startups they were truly wowed by. Yet most admitted that past YC success stories were tough to spot on Demo Day, so we might not know the quality of this batch for a few more years.
One major innovation at Demo Day: they’re now offering Doblet portable chargers so investors don’t have to worry about their phones dying or camping out by the power outlet like the TechCrunch crew.
Here are all 44 of the startups that presented on-the-record today:
Joy – Software eats wedding planning
Weddings can often seem to lead to temporary insanity. Joy is building a tool to help couples plan everything that takes place in-between the engagement and the honeymoon. The company’s marital software suite has seen some major growth over the past several months with about 150 happy couples joining the service daily to manage their RSVPs, track guests and keep everything organized. Joy is now looking to break into the $14 billion wedding registry market where they see even more potential to earn healthy commissions. Joy could disrupt the crooked deals where wedding planners book vendors who give them a bigger cut rather than giving the bride and groom the best price.

Flex – The modern tampon
The tampons women use have seen very little innovation over the last eight decades. Flex has created a tampon replacement set to a subscription model. The company has already sold $70,000 worth of product through pre-orders and has successfully navigated the FDA approval and patenting process. Flex wants women to be able to forget about their periods so they can take advantage of every minute of every day. Traditional tampons can make sexual activity tricky, be messy, and even cause infections. Their disposable menstrual product can be worn for 12 hours and is non-invasive, comfortable and healthy. In a few weeks women will be able to receive shipments of the tampons for $20 per month and the Flex touts 70 percent margins on the product.

JustRide – Getaround for India
Just six percent of adults in India own a car, but as more of the population reaches the middle class, more people want to drive. JustRide is a peer-to-peer car rental marketplace that takes a 25 percent cut of rental fees. The $500 a month that users can earn on JustRide is the same as the average monthly earnings in the country, so it lets users effectively double their wages. The startup’s proprietary IoT device lets it monitor driving behavior and blacklist adrenaline junkies. JustRide already has over 7,000 rentals a month in just three cities, but it’s chasing the full $18.5 billion yearly car rental market in India. While it’s a clone of America’s Getaround, India’s a big enough market to warrant its own competitor.
 
Exponent – Unity for mobile apps
Too often, apps that strike it big on mobile stifle their growth by focusing their scant resources on launching with only an IOS or Android app. Exponent want to make it super simple for mobile developers to build out iOS and Android versions of their app while only coding in JavaScript. The free open-sourced software uses React Native, a framework for building native apps that’s used by companies like Facebook, Airbnb and Walmart. The service just came out of beta this week. Led by early Facebooker and Quora co-founder Charlie Cheever, Exponent has an enviable team.

 
Airfordable – Payment plans for travel
Everyone universally enjoys relaxing on the beach with a mint julep, but not everyone has access to the same disposable income necessary for travel. Airfordable was born as a payment plan service to support travel for people that have limited credit or limited savings. The service lets wannabe travelers upload a flight itinerary and create bi-weekly payment plans that push payments off up to three months. Tickets are distributed only when the payment plan is successfully completed. After reaching profitability and booking $500,000 in sales, the company wants to increase spending to push into financing plans for hotels as well. The company has partnered with an insurance company that is accountable for default risk and is growing at 53 percent month over month.

GoGoGrandparent – Dial-a-rideshare
Senior citizens want independence, but many aren’t versed in using smartphone apps like Uber. GoGoGrandparent lets seniors call via phone to book a ride, which the startup books through existing car services. With a 50 percent margin, Go Go Grandparent is growing 12 percent week over week, and 21 percent of first time users stick with it. Now seniors are asking for help getting groceries and medicine, giving GoGoGrandparent adjacent markets to expand into. Though seniors might get better at smartphones, Go Go Grandparent thinks it can be the layer between them and the on-demand economy.

ZeroDB – Encrypted enterprise cloud storage
The cloud can be a scary place when it comes to keeping enterprise information secure. ZeroDB ensures that companies with sensitive data can move their operations to the cloud without having to worry about compromising overall security. ZeroDB encrypts data and moves it to the cloud while keeping the decryption keys on location. The company announced at demo day that they are already in the process of partnering with a UK bank for an operation that will bring in $1 million annually for the company.

 
Fabric – A network of searchable memories 
In today’s day and age, companies with millions in resources like Google’s Calico are working on combating diseases related to aging like memory loss. A team of ex-Facebook timeline engineers wants to use what they know to create a solution far simpler than drug synthesis. Fabric is an automatic journal that captures experiences and interactions, including GPS location, to generate a complete searchable profile of memories. The app has been one of the top trending apps in the app store and has seen over 1.5 million new real-time checkins.

Skylights – VR as in-flight entertainment
Those tiny seat-back screens cost airlines a fortune because of installation and the weight they add, and they make you feel trapped on the plane. Skylights has developed its own VR headsets and software so passenger can strap in and watch 2D and 3D movies on a giant virtual screen. Skylights has already outfitted 100 flights for 4 airlines, and its current deals for 15 flights a day will bring in $1 million a year in recurring revenue. With a founder who was a former commercial pilot and airline exec, Skylights wants to make VR in-flight entertainment good enough to become a differentiation point.

Haywheel – Artisanal food marketplace
Fantastic restaurants need fantastic ingredients, but the hardest part for chefs should be cooking the food not sourcing it. Haywheel is an online marketplace for artisanal foods that makes it extra simple for top-notch restaurants to score the choicest of lobster or tortellini. The company already has more than 300 restaurants using the service, including a few Michelin-starred establishments. Haywheel takes a 10 percent commission on the food purchased through the marketplace. The service launched last week and is already planning its move to open the program to the $5 billion specialty food store market.

DevColor – A non-profit for attracting and retaining black talent 
Most people in Silicon Valley recognize that the technology industry lacks diversity, but many don’t push themselves and their co-workers to change the status quo. A plethora of Bay Area tech companies are employing strategic recruiting to solve the problem but many have actually seen diversity stagnate and in some cases even decrease in recent years. DevColor wants to employ a non-profit structure to offer interview preparation and career strategy advice to help companies attract and retain black engineers. The startup is working with 114 software engineers and has closed sponsorships with mainstays like Pinterest, Collective Health, and Uber to ultimately reach long-term sustainability by the end of the next two years.

Iris Automations – Collision avoidance drone technology
Commercial drones will grow to a $23 billion business by 2020 for agriculture, infrastructure inspections, and delivery. But many drones still fly blind, dependent on pilots. Iris makes a tiny box that can be added to a drone to give it sense and avoid capabilities. It uses computer vision and deep learning tech to create real-time 3D maps around drones and track objects up to 2000 feet away. It’s already in the air with a live paid alpha program. Drone hardware manufacturers won’t all be able to make the smartest brains, but Iris could help.

Techmate – your technology concierge
Setting up IoT devices sucks. It’d be fine if they kept working but as soon as your wifi goes down or power goes out, something is sure to get screwed up. Techmate wants to bring a more sustained level of tech support to consumers with smart homes. The company says that connected devices will increase 5x in the next 5 years so consumers are going to have a lot more smart light bulbs to take care of. The company currently has $30k in monthly revenue and has been growing 25 percent week-over-week since it launched.

 
Looklive – Shoppable photos
Men’s fashion is a $400 billion a year market growing faster than Women’s. Men want to own clothes, they just don’t love shopping. Looklive’s tech can scan a photo of a model or celebrity, tag what clothes they’re wearing, and let you buy those looks or something similar but more affordable. Looklive is partnering with content creators like Hearst’s Complex and Esquire magazines, which will upload photos to its site. Looklive will make them shoppable and take 10-30 percent of the revenue without owning any stock. Looklive’s co-founder started fashion e-commerce phenomenon KarmaLoop, and now his new startup is growing 25 percent month over month.

Luminostics – Disease diagnosis with smartphone flash 
Taking a far more complex page from early iPhone apps that leverage the iPhone’s flash to detect heart rate, Luminostics wants to use the same flash to diagnose STDs like Chlamydia. To get a diagnosis, all you have to do is add a sample of blood, urine, or saliva to a cartridge and insert it into the smartphone adapter. In 15 minutes, smartphone users can get critical health information. The team decided to start with STDs because of the privacy concerns that put 35 million people at risk every year. The at-home device is fast, convenient, and private unlike traditional doctor visits. The tech was developed as part of PhD research and will be entering clinical trials next year. While the company still has a long way to go before hitting their target of a US and Europe launch in 2018, the founders have an ambitious vision that includes vetinary testing and food safety feedback, in addition to additional applications in consumer health.
 

 
Airo Health – calorie-tracking wearable
There are so many smart health apps out there than can analyze the hell out of your personal data but often the real problem is getting those reliable health metrics in the first place. Airo Health wants to track your calorie intake automatically. They’ve built a $200 wearable that measures the wave-form of your pulse to track blood flow to the digestive system. The research that the company is using suggests a strong correlation between this metric and a person’s total daily calorie consumption. The company has already partnered with the US military and is now targeting the 94 million Americans that are counting calories.

 
New Incentives – Cash for birth at a health clinic
5900 newborns die each day in Africa, many because they’re not born at a health facility. New Incentives is a non-profit that offers conditional cash transfers to mothers who have their kids at a health clinic, which can reduce the risk of infection or spread of HIV. Its 5000-women pilot was shown to save 47 lives. New Incentives is growing 36 percent each week, and has the support of GiveWell, Good Ventures, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Now the non-profit startup is seeking more money for what studies show is one of the top three most cost-effective ways to save a life.

 
MessageBird – Communication APIs to challenge Twilio
On a mission from Amsterdam, MessageBird is not coy about wanting to disrupt Twilio. The company produces APIs for sending SMS, voice, and chat messages. MessageBird has already acquired 13,000 customers including Uber, Skype, and even Dominos pizza. Compared to Twilio, the APIs are being sold as 20 percent faster and 30 percent cheaper than Twilio. Right now, the company only does business outside the United States but wants to use YC as a jumping off point into the U.S. market.

Burrow – On-demand couches
Silicon Valley seems to have descended upon the mattress in recent years as a focus of disruption, but the lowly sofa – another item that’s incredibly annoying to acquire and move- has largely been neglected despite the fact that it’s a $23 billion industry. Burrow wants to give consumers a dead-simple service for buying a couch that is shipped quickly (within a week) and can be assembled without any tools. The company already has $150,000 in pre-sales and is operating at 40 percent gross margins for the $850 sofa.

Miso – Home cleaning in Korea
Miso is taking the home cleaning industry in South Korea and bringing it online. Thanks to Seoul’s density, Miso is already profitable there and will be in two more cities by next month. While it’s very difficult to retain cleaners in the US, it’s seen as a good job in South Korea where people can earn 60 percent more than in other jobs. Miso is growing 13 percent each week, has 600 weekly active cleaners, and customers are demanding additional types of service. On-demand cleaning is a capital intensive business which has seen failures in the US, but Korea could prove different.

Multiply Labs – Customizable supplement pills 
Taking pills sucks, not only do you have to remember to take your medicine at specific times, but you also often have to remember to take more pills than meals you eat a day. Multiply Labs is leveraging robotics and 3D printing to build made to order “designer” personal supplements. This means that you can go online and specify the substances that will appear in the pills shipped to you. You can even specify the duration of delivery for drugs like caffeine to hit at just the right time. Traditional pharmaceutical companies print pills in large batches, but Multiply Labs is using 3D printers to form the custom pills, and robots to fill them.

Sixa – Low-latency cloud-based PCs
Consumers have more interest in buying VR headsets than they do in plopping $1k on the high-powered gaming PCs that it takes to run them. Only one percent of the PCs out there are powerful enough for VR, Sixa want to change that by putting a specced-out virtual machine onto everyone’s system. Latency is a huge concern for cloud-based PC virtualization and it’s even more key in VR where the slightest increase in tracking latency can lead to some major user queasiness. Sixa claims that they’ve gotten the latency down to 10 milliseconds, an impressive metric that’s helping drive their $101,000 in monthly recurring revenue.

 
ConstructVR – Distribution of enterprise VR apps
The ConstructVR team is bullish on enterprise VR, so much so that they have created a platform for the distribution of VR apps to enterprises. While the market may seem small now, analysts project that 46 percent of VR apps will be used in an enterprise context. Samsung’s own GearVR team is using ConstructVR to distribute sales training to help employees sell more products. Without a cloud interface, companies have to use physical USB cables to distribute applications. The company is doing $7,500 in monthly recurring revenue and has requests in the pipeline for an additional $50,000 per month.

 
Simbi – Bartering marketplace
Most people have too much time and not enough money. Simbi lets them barter their skills for those of other people. Through its credits system, you could train someone in yoga in exchange for dog walking, or give dance lessons for home cleaning. Simbi is growing 95 percent per month, and $100,000 in services are being traded each month. The bartering market could be magnitudes bigger than the $14 billion estimate if there was a clearing house like Simbi to make exchanges simple and safe.

Aptonomy – Autonomous drone security guards
For sites that need to move their security needs way beyond the “smile, you’re on camera” signs, there aren’t a ton of great options. Security guards can be inefficient and undependable, and security cameras can’t really do anything in terms of actually stopping an intruder. Aptonomy is hoping that drones are the answer. The company has built self-flying drones that can move around a set area and detect/record intruders or move about to physically stop them.

Mentat – Help young professionals get jobs
Nobody likes applying to jobs, especially millennials. The job application has become far more “spray and pray” than ever before, and young job seekers easily feel overwhelmed managing large networks across dozens of companies. To combat this problem, Mentat wants to completely change the application process by automating resume reviews, app submissions, and interview coordination. The company is growing revenue at 40 percent week over week and has done $70,000 in revenue over the last month. Mentat is launching a paid pilot with the City University of New York (CUNY) that will be scaleable to $5 million in recurring revenue by the end of the year.

Raptor Maps – Drone-based farming analytics
Farmers don’t know which acres of their farms produce the most crops. Raptor Maps uses drones and tractor-mounted sensors to analyze and A/B test farmland. Raptor Maps can tell farmers which seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides work the best. It can boost farmer profits and even make food a little healthier. Raptor Maps charges $100/acre and already has paid alpha installations with farms that sell to McDonald’s and Costco. Eventually, it could even sell data on which crops are growing to grocery chains and food wholesalers.

 
Scale – An API for human labor
Scale lets developers use an API to enter requests for flocks of humans to complete repetitive tasks. Mechanical Turk has quality control issues while business process outsourcing can’t be called via API and the firms are too big to work with some startups. Scale lets developers for Houzz get their housing listings screened for duplicates and price mismatches. Teespring uses Scale for moderation and categorization of user generated content. Scale is growing 40 percent week over week with over 50 percent gross margins. Computers can’t do every menial task, but now they can request humans that will do the rest.

SimpleCitizen – TurboTax for immigration
Over 13 million Americans have to sort through green card and citizenship applications each year and it can take weeks or months for everything to get ironed out. SimpleCitizen is aiming to make the process of navigating immigration documents a bit more tolerable. The company charges users $249 to cut down this whole process into just a few hours of work. The company has earned $40k in revenue in the last 30 days helping individuals and families in 90 countries with their immigration documents. Up next for the company is simplifying the process of applying for visas.

Yoshi – Car ownership as-a-service
When most people think of getting a fill-up, they instinctively think about their personal automobiles. However, busses, municipal vehicles, and dealership inventory all sit idle for significant portions of the day and still need to be ready at a moment’s notice with very minimal room for error. Yoshi has been successful at entering this market and offering previously unavailable fill-ups for a $15 dollar a month membership fee on a 24 cent per gallon margin. However, the company is also looking to address the everyday car owner. By incorporating additional services like selling engine cleaner, replacing tires, exchanging wiper blades, and offering to wash and detail vehicles, the company hopes to access a larger market and boost margins to 40 or even 50 percent. The company already has partnerships with companies like Firestone and is planning to launch a pilot in a month with a Detroit automaker.

Squire – OpenTable for barbershops
Most barbershops still handle appointment booking over the phone with pen and paper or outdated salon software. Squire lets customers book appointments over mobile in exchange for a $1 fee. Squire’s founders even owned and operated a barbershop just to find out what customers need. When Squire onboards a shop, they in turn recruit all their customers, which become paid users of Squire. It can earn $1000 a month per barbershop, and there are 300,000 barbershops in the US. While the X for Y startup cliche might seem a bit tired, Squire may have found a permutation that works.

Starcity – comfortable communal housing in SF
The housing crisis in San Francisco is no joke, yet there often seems to be little in the way of tech solutions from Silicon Valley that truly help the “average” cash-strapped SF apartment hunters. Starcity wants to build comfortable communal housing in San Francisco that makes use of the millions of square feet in unused residential space in San Francisco. The one-bed, one-bath units are 50 percent the price of the average insanely expensive SF studio apartment.

 
Vote.org – Get out the vote with big data
Vote.org wants to beat big money in politics with even bigger get out the vote data. Groups like Rock The Vote have built massive partnerships with celebrities and corporations to increase turnout at the polls, but the strongest data tools often rest in the hands of the parties themselves. Vote.org wants to unlock hyper-targeted applications of data for get out the vote efforts. The non-profit plans to reach 1.2 million voters in specific urban areas. This year, $10.2 billion will be spent on competitive races with anywhere between $12 and $315 spent per voter. If Vote.org can come up with enough funding, it will utilize SMS to to impact political engagement.

Coub – YouTube for video loops
60 percent of video viewers don’t make it past the first 10 seconds of a clip. Coub wants to target these viewers with short video loops. After focusing heavily on making creation intuitive, the company has seen a 4X increase in loops created every month on the platform. Users can feed in footage from Youtube, Facebook, and UploadHero, trim the footage to find the best parts, and overdub the soundtrack. Coub is seeing an insane amount of traffic for its size, with 800 million video views per month with its video version of popular GIFs.

OMG Digital – BuzzFeed for Africa
Media companies in Africa aren’t moving fast enough to adapt to mobile and the taste of millenials. OMG Digital makes mobile-first content, and has grown to six million monthly users spending 14 minutes per day, and it only launched six months ago. 90 percent of its users are on mobile, and the startup is signing ad deals with Guinness and the African telecoms. By copying BuzzFeed’s model for a unique market, OMG Digital could give African millenials something to read that’s written specifically for them.

Suiteness – Hotel suite booking platform
The best rooms in luxury hotels aren’t on Expedia or Priceline, and sometimes they’re not even on the hotel’s website. But if you want to travel in style or in a big group, they can be the best option. Suiteness creates a platform that showcases these unique rooms and lets you book them. Its average booking price is $2194, from which it earns $315 on a customer acquisition cost of $138. That means it earns back the money in the first booking. Suiteness has 30,000 suites from top hotels like the Wynn, Venetian, and Cosmopolitan on the platform already, and it’s aiming to increase booking transparency for all the 300,000 suites in 100 cities.

274,Jobless in the self-driving economy,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/18/dropping-off-drivers/,2016/08/18,"
Uber’s self-driving cars will hit the road this month, earlier than anticipated. That’s an exciting surprise…unless of course you’re a driver. They won’t be the only ones affected, though. The consequences of robot-induced unemployment could eventually ripple through the rest of the economy.
What will happen to Uber’s 1 million drivers? And the 3.5 million truck drivers in the US? And the countless millions of delivery, bus, taxi, and other drivers around the world?
These jobs won’t disappear overnight. It could take 20 years. But if we don’t plan for this labor shift, it could cause mass hardship for some even while delivering mass convenience to others.

Self-driving cars are undoubtedly the future. They’ll be significantly safer and more relaxing. They’ll reduce traffic and carbon emissions. And they could free up productive time for knowledge workers that used to be spent stuck behind the wheel.
They’ll also be a lot cheaper than paying a person to pilot the vehicle.
Bloomberg writes, “Trips will be free for the time being, rather than the standard local rate of $1.30 per mile. In the long run, [Uber CEO Travis] Kalanick says, prices will fall so low that the per-mile cost of travel, even for long trips in rural areas, will be cheaper in a driverless Uber than in a private car.” Oh, and Uber just announced it has acquired a self-driving truck company.
Dropped Off
The problem is driving constitutes one of the core forms of low-skilled labor alongside cashiers and fast-food prep. The robots are coming for all of them. Some argue that technology will create new jobs for these people. Though while it may create new jobs, they likely won’t be attainable by those losing their low-skilled ones.
Think of it this way. When cars were invented, they threatened the low-skilled laborers that used to bring people and objects around: horses. As laid out by this fantastic Humans Need Not Apply video, the idea that “better technology will create more better jobs for horses” immediately seems ludicrous. Replacing “horses” with “humans” in that sentence shouldn’t inspire much more optimism.

What this shift to autonomy will do to the economy is roll the earnings of the replaced low-skilled laborers up to the owners and designers of the self-driving fleets, cookdroids, and cashierbots. It’s a Marxist nightmare.
Software has already been causing a similar effect, but the proliferation of autonomous robots will allow this revolution to grow beyond bits and invade the realm of atoms.
That’s why the next President needs to start preparing us now, though hopefully without impeding the speed of innovation. Education, job training, and placement services will be essential. Hell, just recognizing and talking about the problem will be a good start.
Long-term, we’ll need to take a long, hard look at how capitalism works in an era where technology replaces jobs faster than it creates them. Must everyone have a full-time role? Can we redistribute wealth from the top so the bottom doesn’t starve without devolving into inefficiency and stagnation? How would that impact the psyches of citizens raised to define their own value by how much bread they earn, not how much they receive?
Those are complicated questions without definitive answers. We’ll need plenty of time to figure them out. But today Uber made it clear the future’s ETA is a lot sooner than we expected.

275,A first look at the Alta Motors all-electric-motorcycle factory,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/15/a-first-look-at-alta-motors-all-electric-motorcycle-factory/,2016/08/15," 



Motorcycle makers Alta Motors have opened the doors to their new factory in Brisbane, California, and TechCrunch was on the scene for a first look.
A quick trip from downtown San Francisco, the factory is in a low and unassuming concrete structure. Inside, it’s surprisingly quiet, thanks in part to the fact that the motorcycles Alta makes are all-electrics, and final assembly of these bikes is ultimately done by hand.
The startup’s flagship product, the Redshift MX, is a motocross bike newly shipping to dealers and retailing at $14,995.
The company also makes a street-legal version of this bike, the Redshift SM, which sells for $15,495.
Why build their own factory rather than outsource to markets known for motorcycle manufacturing, especially Japan, home of Yamaha and others?

Alta Motors’ CEO and co-founder Marc Fenigstein said, “Everything we’ve done in-house we’ve been able to do faster, cheaper and at higher output than outsourced. The hardest part is bringing up a supply chain that delivers all 460 parts that we need on time on quality and on cost.”
For the unfamiliar, Alta Motors, formerly known as BRD Motorcycles, is one of the electric vehicle makers that has managed not to burn out or fade away, while others like Mission Motors, Coda and Aptera shuttered, and Brammo and Fisker pivoted and retrenched.
Fenigstein said one thing that’s special about the company’s Redshift bike is that its battery carries 80 percent more range, per pound, than any other battery in motorcycles. The Redshift bikes accelerate from 0 to 60 in 3.3 seconds.
And in an environment where the tires are constantly gaining and losing traction, Redshift’s electric drive train and software offer riders a higher degree of control over their bikes’ movement than traditional, gasoline powered bikes, even the high-performance variety, the company claims.

With 50 full-time employees, Alta makes all the electronics that run their motorcycles, and the packaging that contains their batteries. They acquire battery cells, wheels, tires, brakes and suspension systems from other suppliers.
Their bikes’ batteries specifically weigh about 70 lbs. (30 kg) and have a capacity of 5.8 kilowatt hours, according to Alta Motors CTO and co-founder Derek Dorresteyn.
All-electric bikes don’t require the same maintenance as gasoline-powered bikes — including oil changes, air filter changes and frequent engine rebuilds — Dorresteyn noted.
That, and acceleration that’s comparable to or better than gas bikes, makes the Redshift appealing to riders who don’t want to spend as much time fixing things as riding or competing.

Within 3 years, Alta plans to be selling the Redshift, and other all-electric products, internationally.
That could make the San Francisco startup competitive with companies like Gogoro in China, as well as other U.S.-based electric-vehicle motorcycle makers like Zero Motorcycles and Harley-Davidson, which plans to release an electric bike, eventually.
Dorresteyn and Fenigstein declined to specify what other vehicles Alta may develop and when, but they said their technology could work in scooters and smaller motorcycles that are prolific globally.
Alta has raised $17.5 million in equity funding to date, with additional venture debt financing of $2 million.
The company counts among its advisors and angel backers Tesla’s original founder and battery tech inventor Martin Eberhard, and EnduroCross inventor and the man credited with getting flat-track motorcycle racing into the X Games, Eric Peronnard.

276,"7Sensors Grow Box will automatically care for your plants, from produce to pot",https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/12/7sensors-grow-box-will-automatically-care-for-your-plants-from-produce-to-pot/,2016/08/12,"
Everyone loves a good plant in their home, but few have the time and dedication to keep it healthy over the course of the year. Changing temperatures and humidity levels paired with vacations or business trips can limit the variety of plant-life that most people can sustain in their homes.
That’s where the Grow Box comes in.
Developed by former Apple engineer Andrew Pletenetskyy, the Grow Box is a nearly six-foot box that can automate the entire process of growing a plant, whether it’s a ficus or an indoor vegetable plant or (I know you’ve been waiting for this one!) weed.
The Grow Box is the first product from 7Sensors, and has been in the prototyping phase for a while now. The company has successfully grown bell peppers and (yes!) a cannabis plant, among other things.
The Grow Box pairs with an app to let you designate the type of plant inside, and from there, Grow Box does all the work. Of course, green thumbs are able to fine-tune the environment within the Grow Box to experiment with their own plants.

Grow Box controls environmental factors like light schedule, humidity, temperature, and air flow. Plus, the Grow Box is equipped with reflectors to ensure that the product is sustainable — 7Sensors says that the Grow Box can grow a plant with the same energy consumption of a single light bulb.
That said, I’m curious to see how many people will opt for fresh, automatically grown plants in exchange for an aesthetically pleasing home. That’s not to say that the Grow Box is ugly, but it’s quite large and will most certainly catch the eye of anyone walking into the same room.
Obviously, this isn’t the first time someone has tried to build an automated greenhouse for the home.
Leaf, for example, is a Disrupt Battlefield company that launched a plug-and-plant option for cannabis growers. Edn, on the other hand, is a wall-hanging garden that is meant to automatically grow herbs and produce without much interaction from the owner.
While the Leaf has yet to start selling, Edn recently became available for purchase for $499.
For now, we have no idea what the price point will be for a single unit of the Grow Box, but the company plans to launch a Kickstarter soon. We’ll be sure to keep you in the loop as soon as they do.

BMW isn’t letting off the gas on its electric vehicle program – the company plans replacements for the i3 and i8 by 2022, according to Automobile Magazine, and a new entrant dubbed Project i20 internally (but likely to be known as the i5 or i6 when it hits streets) on track for 2021. The i20 has a fully electric drivetrain, like the i3 before it, and will also offer BMW’s most sophisticated autonomous driving features to date.
The i20 will have multiple drivetrain options, ranging from 136 hp at the low end, to a powerful 247 hp at the top. Automobile describes it as a “bigger, prettier, and more aerodynamic i3,” which should go over well with potential BMW electric buyers, since the i3’s design is fairly divisive overall (I love the little guy, personally).
But the bigger news might be the self-driving features. There aren’t any details about what’s planned for the i20 initially beyond that it’ll have “advanced autonomous” features, but the report claims a fully self-driving version is planned for a debut in 2025.
The i3 updates planed for 2022 include a number of different proposals currently in consideration, including one design that uses the current carbon-fiber body build, one with an all-aluminum chassis, and a final version with a blend of a number of different materials.
The i8’s update, which the magazine says could slip to 2023, looks like will abandon the current hybrid design and opt for an all-electric three-motor, 750 hp drivetrain with batteries boasting a 300 mile driving range.
These all sound like solid additions to BMW’s EV lineup, but the i20 is probably the most intriguing, both because we’ll get to see it before the others if the roadmap stays true, and because of its self-driving capabilities. Plus, it sounds like it might try to thread the needle between the two extremes of the i3 and the i8, which could put it squarely in competition with the likes of the Tesla Model S.

278,"Karma Revero hybrid electric sports car revealed, complete with solar roof",https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/11/karma-revero-hybrid-electric-sports-car-revealed-complete-with-solar-roof/,2016/08/11,"
The Fisker Karma is back, reborn as the Karma Revero, with a familiar look, along with a new name and some design tweaks and feature additions that mark a departure from its origins. Today marks the first time we’ve seen the Revero, revealed via images shared by Karma detailing the car’s exterior, as well as its unique solar roof and redesigned infotainment system.
Karma is a car company with a lot to prove: The Southern California-based automaker rose from the ashes of Fisker, an electric pioneer in the plug-in hybrid sports vehicle market that, early on, looked poised to potentially compete with Tesla. Fisker burned through cash quickly, though, and earned a reputation for far too firey mechanical failures. Fisker went bankrupt in 2013, but Chinese auto part supplier Wanxiang acquired the assets, installed new leadership and are in the process of relaunching the company as Karma, the name of Fisker’s original flagship car.
The Karma Revero is a lot like the Fisker in terms of general appearance, with the same stunning curves you might expect from an English sports car (original designer Henrik Fisker did design the Aston Martin DB9, after all). And the design of the original was basically universally loved by critics and fans, so keeping the aesthetic is probably smart.

Karma is emphasizing changes to the tech within, however, to distance itself from the shortcomings of its previous existence. There’s a brand new infotainment system, for instance, which the company called “simple, intuitive and beautiful.” Karma seems possibly to be taking a potshot at Tesla regarding the dash display, noting that “if you like a 200 page supplement to the owner’s manual,” just to operate it, you should look elsewhere.
Another feature Karma is highlighting in this early tease (the full reveal happens on September 8) is its roof, which features integrated solar panels the company says can “power the vehicle.” We’ll have to see what exactly that entails once the full specs are announced.
Karma’s Revero is a very good-looking car, with design chops that should indeed merit the $100,000 starting price tag the vehicle will carry. But the key ingredient here was always going to be performance, and for that we’ll have to wait and see what Karma delivers.

279,Abundant Robotics spins out of SRI to bring apple-picking robots to the farm,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/10/abundant-robotics-spins-out-of-sri-to-bring-apple-picking-robots-to-the-farm/,2016/08/10,"
Apples are the second most commonly consumed fruit in the U.S., according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, but the way apples are harvested in the orchard hasn’t changed much in the past two centuries. It’s still a manual process, by and large.
Now, SRI Ventures, a kind of startup incubator within the Menlo Park research and development firm SRI International, is investing in and spinning out a startup called Abundant Robotics Inc. to automate apple harvesting with agricultural robots currently in development.
The robots, as yet unnamed, were designed to be strong and fast enough to remove one fruit per second from a tree, but gentle enough not to damage trees or the fruit, according to Abundant Robotics’ CEO and co-founder Dan Steere.
They employ computer vision to recognize apples on the branch that are ready for harvesting, and a kind of vacuum to remove the apples, Steere said.
For power, the robots are plugged into the small tractors already used pervasively in fruit farming.
Steere co-founded Abundant Robotics about a year ago, he says, with CTO Curt Salisbury and Senior Software Architect Michael Eriksen recognizing a massive market opportunity in agriculture.
The team had previously worked on research funded by SRI and additional, non-dilutive grants from the Washington Tree Fruit commission to bring automation to the field.
Farmers typically produce more than 9 billion pounds of apples domestically, exporting 2.3 billion pounds of them in 2014-2015, according to the USDA. And international consumption of them has been growing.
Steere said, “Seeing fruit and picking it without damaging it is the big engineering challenge. If you bruise or cut the fruit it loses its value.”
According to SRI Ventures President, Manish Kothari, it had not been possible to automate the task of apple picking before recent breakthroughs in computer vision and image processing were made.
He said, “You direct this robot to go someplace, see and pick an apple, and go again. It’s a very non-trivial engineering challenge. To detect apples very precisely you have to see down at the millimeter level in real time. That requires software, and on the hardware side, chips that allow you to do real time image processing on the fly.”
SRI Ventures in 2016 has already spun out 7 companies this year so far, he noted, including Superflex and others all of which have attracted outside, venture investments.
Abundant Robotics declined to disclose how much funding it had raised, but Kothari and Steere confirmed the startup has closed an equity seed round in addition to its grant funding.
While most of the intellectual property the company developed so far was created at SRI, some was developed in partnership with robotics labs at Carnegie Mellon University, Steere said, and the company has a tech transfer agreement with the school.
Following its spin out from SRI Ventures, Abundant Robotics will aim to have its autonomous, robotic apple pickers in production and at work in orchards within 2 years, and grow its 8-person team currently based at SRI in Menlo Park, Calif.
The company has conducted field trials with orchards in Washington state, and overseas in Australia. It plans to engage in more of these prior to commercialization of its robots, Steere said.
Although a representative for Abundant Robotics claimed the startup wasn’t releasing any images of its vacuum picker, a trade news site called Good Fruit Grower has one from a closed demo in March, here.

280,Elon Musk says SolarCity will build a “solar roof” for your house,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/10/elon-musk-says-solarcity-will-build-a-solar-roof-for-your-house/,2016/08/10,"
What if your entire roof was made up entirely of dedicated solar power cells? No, not adorned with the current kind of solar panels you’ve likely seen on the existing roofs of a few neighbour houses – an entire roof actually made up of solar gathering material, rather than add-ons that install after the fact. That’s the vision described by Elon Musk in SolarCity’s investor call yesterday (via Elecktrek).
Musk, who acts as board Chairman rather than occupying a company executive role, joined TeslaCity likely because of his proposal that Tesla buy SolarCity. That deal remains in progress, with a $2.6 billion stock offer agreed upon by both companies and now awaiting shareholder approval.
On the call, Musk followed a reveal by SolarCity CEO Lyndon Rive that SolarCity would have two product s to unveil by the end of this year with a comment that the company is working on “a solar roof, as opposed to modules on a roof.” Rive echoed the product details, and Musk said that part of their product’s appeal vs. Other solutions will be that customers end up with “a beautiful roof,” as opposed to “a thing on the roof.”
By creating a product that actually replaces roofing material, SolarCity’s power generation offering becomes not an add-on, but a core housing component, with a much easier sell opportunity both for new construction and whenever a home has to re-roof (typically once every 20 years or so depending on the type of shingle used). Both Musk and Rive signalled they see a huge market opportunity in new roof builds.
It’s very likely that a solar roof option would be more expensive than a traditional one – probably by a wide margin. But SolarCity will also probably market in the cost of power production over however long the roof will last, which I’m sure will more than balance the construction cost, at least on paper.

GM is putting its Cruise acquisition to good use in Arizona: The self-driving car startup acquired by the automaker in March is trialling its tech on public roads in Scottsdale. Cruise tweeted about the autonomous testing expansion, which uses Chevrolet Bolt all-electric vehicles, and which adds to the core fleet of testing vehicles already operating in San Francisco.

— Cruise Automation (@Cruise) August 8, 2016



Cruise’s self-driving Bolt hit San Francisco streets in May, but provided few details beyond acknowledging that it was doing testing. GM has aggressive goals in terms of productizing its Cruise acquisition, however: The Wall Street Journal reported that GM hopes to put self-driving taxis into usage tests in partnership with Lyft “within a year.”
Scottsdale makes sense for a field test, since the area already plays host to Google self-driving cars, and the state has strong regulatory support for self-driving vehicle tests in general. GM’s Innovation Center is also based in nearby Chandler.
GM confirmed the Arizona tests but isn’t providing any more information about this time.

282,Karma details Revero sales strategy as owner Wanxiang plans electric car factory,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/08/karma-details-revero-sales-strategy-as-owner-wanxiang-plans-electric-car-factory/,2016/08/08,"
Wanxiang Group, which acquired the assets of plug-in hybrid pioneer Fisker and renamed it Karma Automotive, is planning a large-scale $375 million electric car factory with an output capacity of 50,000 vehicles per year, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Karma Automotive also revealed its distribution model for the Revero plug-in hybrid it plans to release later this year, with a big reveal planned for September 8.
In 2014, Wanxiang acquired Fisker Automotive out of bankruptcy and gave it the backing needed to resume operations, but switched the company’s brand to that of its first product: The Karma, which got a debut at the North American Auto Show in 2008 but only ever achieved a total production run of 2,450 over the course of its existence. The renamed Karma also got new management, and a new California-based production site to go with the new owner.
Karma’s Revero will be its first production vehicle following these shifts, with a $100,000 starting price tag and a launch window of “later this year.” The Souther California-based company revealed its launch distribution plans today, including use of licensed third-party luxury car deals, and its own “Experience Center” direct sales locations.

Potential Revero customers will be able to shop Karma’s offerings in Atlanta, Chicago, Ft. Worth, Miami, Palm Beach, Pasadena, Philadelphia, Detroit, Montreal and Toronto when the go on sale, all at high-end third-party dealerships that also stock cars from companies including Lamborghini, McClaren, Porsche and others.
Karma’s owned sales facilities will offer a much more brand-specific sales experience, and the first of these is planned for Orange County. This will provide the setting for the initial Revero reveal in September, too.
Wanxiang’s application filing detailing its upcoming China-based electric vehicle factory includes confirmation that it will be producing vehicles based on the vehicle platforms it acquired from Fisker, including the Karma and Atlantic, a two-door sport coupe. Wanxiang currently only manufactures car parts, but is hoping to receive approval from the Chinese government to expand into full car production with this new factor proposal.

283,NASA funds long shots aiming to make electric and eco-friendly aircraft,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/05/nasa-funds-long-shots-aiming-to-make-electric-and-eco-friendly-aircraft/,2016/08/05,"
One of these days we’re going to see aircraft go electric, just as cars are — but not for a while. In the meantime, we can’t slack off when it comes to the research that will make it possible. NASA has announced five research projects that may help make planes more efficient and green.
It’s part of the organization’s Transformative Aeronautics Concepts Program, which has dozens of such internal projects aimed at improving or (as the name suggests) transforming aviation. These five were picked from a series of pitches made to the TACP team, Startup Battlefield style (or close, anyway), and awarded 2 years of funding at $2 million per year.
The thing preventing electric aircraft from taking off, so to speak, boils down to a lack of energy: even the best batteries can’t store nearly as much power as an equivalent volume of jet fuel. We can make better use of the energy we can store by making aircraft lighter and their propulsion more efficient, but ultimately the batteries themselves need to get better.

One project is aimed at accomplishing that last goal with the creation of Lithium-Air batteries, which use oxygen as the active electron carrier, sucking it in when they’re being discharged and expelling it when charging. Li-Air batteries could theoretically achieve fossil fuel-like energy density, but there are serious technical challenges — ones the NASA team will be looking at.
Replacing the battery with a fuel cell is another option; one project is looking into the possibility of a super-efficient cell that would combine oxygen from the air with the hydrogen from jet fuel to produce electricity, then use the exhaust to drive a turbine. It would still be using fossil fuels, but it would be extracting more energy from them and doing it in a much cleaner way.
The electric engine being driven by that energy could also be more efficient; 3D printing might be a solution. Improved additive manufacturing techniques may enable smaller, more power-dense motors — or if not, at least make them lighter.
Another way to save weight is to lose some off the body of the plane itself. The vertical tail fin is used to center the plane, but it also adds drag. NASA is looking into the possibility of using adjustable winglets that can serve as stabilizers during take-off and landing, but flatten out for better aerodynamics during flight. This would reduce the need for a large tail fin, so the plane could be both lighter and present a lower profile.
The last project isn’t quite green, but it’s still interesting. Unmanned aerial vehicles currently need to be operated within radio line of sight; satellite tracking would be better, but the antennas required are bulky. Researchers are investigating the possibility of an aerogel-based antenna that conforms closely to the contours of the aircraft yet enables transmission and receiving in multiple directions.
NASA doesn’t expect all or even any of the projects to bear fruit — “Is failure an option? It depends on your definition of failure,” said the TACP manager, Doug Rohn, in the news release. Really, the point isn’t to make the things described above, but to determine whether they realistically can be made, and the answer may well be no — at least for now.

284,"Mercedes-Benz said to plan EV sub-brand, with multiple SUVs and sedans",https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/05/mercedes-electric-car-plans/,2016/08/05,"
Mercedes-Benz isn’t just planning one or two all-electric vehicle options to woo customers away from competitors, including BMW and Tesla who are further along with their EV lineups — it has four models in the works, according to sources speaking to Bloomberg. These cars will be offered under a new sub-brand with a new name, per the report.
The first of these will likely come at the Paris Motor Show, which happens in October, and at which Mercedes-Benz CEO Dieter Zetsche has also promised an electric vehicle from the company will be revealed. But Bloomberg says the lineup will include two electric SUVs and two electric sedans, which are currently set to go to market by 2020. The first, which is the one that we’ll apparently see at the Paris show, will be an SUV, with an impressive max range of about 500 km (310 miles) on one charge.
This prototype vehicle, if it indeed boasts that kind of range in addition to the cargo capacity advantages of a sport utility, would have a lot of potential among EV competitors. Tesla’s Model X, which is the closest production vehicle comparable to what it sounds like Mercedes is going to reveal, notably hits the exact same max range when the 250-257 mile on the P90 and P90D variants is translated into the European testing method.
Of course, there are a lot of caveats there, not least of which is that the Mercedes truck doesn’t actually exist yet, while Tesla is shipping Model X units to customers. We also don’t know much about the German automaker’s consumer plans beyond what Bloomberg is reporting – though the results of its efforts in transport trucks is a promising sign it has its legs underneath it when it comes to electric drivetrains and battery tech.
Mercedes has the hybrid E-Class and the electric drive option B-Class in terms of existing electric vehicles, but the B-Class boasts a max range of just 87 miles, so it’s not exactly a Model S killer. In general, more EV competition in the consumer space is good for the entire market, so here’s hoping Mercedes does indeed have some strong offerings that actually hit the roads over the next few years.

285,Nissan’s working BladeGlider sport EV prototype calls to car lovers,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/04/nissan-bladeglider-ev-sports-car/,2016/08/04,"

Nissan is bringing a working version of the BladeGlider all-electric sport concept it first revealed in 2013 to Rio to ride the hype wave of the Olympics. The car is cool enough to merit hype in its own right, as a performance-engineered zero emission EV from a company that typically stays in the more conservative end of the market with staid offerings like the Nissan Leaf.
Now, first, let me preface what I’m about to say by acknowledging that the BladeGlider is indeed cool, as a car, as something that looks like a convincing set piece from a Luc Besson sci-fi epic, and as an engineering project. It’s a technological feat that many engineers and designers clearly put a lot of time and effort into.
But I find it very hard to ignore that the name “BladeGlider,” along with its two color options of “Cyber Green” and “Stealth Orange,” make it sound like the product we’re talking about here is actually the latest 5-bladed, garishly colored razor monstrosity from Gillette or Schick.
Okay, branding aside, this “EV for car lovers,” as it’s described by Daniele Shillaci, Executive Vice President of Global Marketing and Sales at Nissan, is genuinely interesting as a fully functioning example of where the automaker sees the performance end of the EV market heading.

It definitely looks race track-inspired, with a narrow nose and a wider back Nissan says provide “aerodynamic efficiency” and more stable handling, plus there’s wonderfully absurd rear-hinged doors Nissan freely admits is aimed at generating dramatic effect.
The powertrain comes from the U.K.’s Williams Advanced Engineering, and demo models can exceed 190km/h (around 115mph) with a zero to sixty time of less than five seconds in testing. It’s the motors on each of its real wheels that provide that propulsion generate a combined 268 hp, which is a lot for the relatively light 2,866-pound vehicle.

Nissan didn’t just go bare-bones on the interior, either; the roof is open to give you the feeling of being connected to the road, and the race-style seats with four-point harnesses provide room for a driver and two offset passengers behind them. The dashboard is simple and clean, but still offers three monitors to keep an eye on things, including a central display offering real-time data from the car, with the flanking screens showing feeds from rear-view cameras seated behind the front wheels.
I can forgive Nissan the trespasses of the razor naming conventions, since the razor industry basically lifted that macho garbage from the auto industry to begin with. And since we could use more cars like the BMW i8 and Model S that push the limits of what we think of as high-end EV, it’s nice to see Nissan push this one past the concept stage and into something drivable.

286,Nissan says EV chargers will outnumber gas stations in the UK by 2020,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/04/nissan-says-ev-chargers-will-outnumber-gas-stations-in-the-uk-by-2020/,2016/08/04,"
A new study by car maker Nissan predicts the U.K. will have more electric vehicle charging locations than gas stations by 2020. It’s a bold prediction to estimate that EV chargers will outnumber places to gas up in just four short years, but Nissan is counting on both a continued decline in the number of operational gas stations, as well as new charge points coming online.
The attrition rate for gas stations in the U.K. is high: Nissan found that more than 75 percent of those operational four decades ago have closed and not been replaced, leaving a total of just 8,472 in the country (from a high-water mark of 37,539 in 1970). Following that curve, the car maker guesses that by 2020, the number will have dropped to 7,870.
Chargers are on the rise, however, and while currently, the U.K. boasts only 4,100 locations, its rate of growth is such that it should hit 7,900 charging spots in the next four years. Electric car registration is also growing at a rapid clip: A joint government and car maker campaign to promote low emission vehicles found that in the beginning months of 2016, a new electric car was registered every 13 minutes, on average.
Now Nissan has reason to hype the growth of EV infrastructure: It claims the honor of being the first to market with a “mass-produced electric vehicle” (the LEAF) and continues to push its all-electric cars as an ideal solution for U.K. urban commuters.
But even if Nissan has a clear interest in the market, its optimism is something that others can probably get behind. If the pace of EV infrastructure support is truly not on the rise, even if primarily in markets like the U.K. where the average driver isn’t worried about range anxiety on long trips, that’s something to celebrate.

287,Powerplant Ventures closes $42 million fund to back “plant-centric” food and tech startups,https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/03/powerplant-ventures-closes-42-million-fund-to-back-plant-centric-food-and-tech-startups/,2016/08/03,"
In recent years, venture capital has poured into food companies, from meal kit and grocery delivery services to the makers of environmentally sustainable, or health-promoting food products.
Now, investors and entrepreneurs from tech, food and the restaurant industry have launched a firm, and closed a $42 million debut fund called Powerplant Ventures, to invest specifically in “plant-centric” and “better for you” food and tech companies.
The firm’s co-founding partners include ZICO Coconut Water founder Mark Rampolla, who sold his beverage business to Coca Cola in 2013; Kevin Boylan and T.K. Pillan, co-founders of the vegetarian restaurant chain, Veggie Grill, which has served 1.2 million guests over the past 90 days; and Dan Beldy, formerly the Managing Director of Disney’s venture capital arm, Steamboat Ventures.
According to Beldy, Powerplant VC will do seed, Series A and B deals, writing checks up to $250,000 in a seed round, or between $1 million to $2 million dollar checks in Series A or B deals, more typically.
Beldy also said the firm will look for what venture capitalists usually want in any industry: companies with at least a million in revenue and growing for earlier stage deals and startups with a strong team, differentiated products and great market potential at any stage.
In later-stage deals, the firm is expecting to invest alongside of top-tier venture firms that also back consumer packaged goods and e-commerce startups, and corporate strategic investors in the food and beverage business.
Why the emphasis on vegan and vegetarian products, or companies that sell and distribute them?
Boylan said, referencing United Nations World Food Programme studies, “We’re not delivering the nutrition and wellness we need in a way that’s sustainable enough to feed a world population of 9 billion people by 2050. And raising livestock for food produces more greenhouse gas emissions than all of the world’s transportation systems, combined.”
Beldy added that, besides the wish to invest in products and companies that can reduce pollution and feed the world without sacrificing health, Powerplant VC and its limited partners see huge consumer shifts in food consumption that will lead to high returns.
“The scientific committee that advises the FDA recently said that a diet higher in plant based foods and lower in animal based foods promotes better health, and that’s going to have an impact on how Americans think about food. Of course. But Millennials have already changed the game in food. They are checking labels and want to know what is the origin of the things they are putting into their bodies. They want to eat healthier,” he said. “Ergo, demand will drive supply.”
Powerplant Ventures is in good company investing in this shifting, massive market.
Among other investors drawn to the food segment are: S2G Ventures, Obvious Ventures, CAVU Ventures, New Crop Capital and CircleUp. All of these are actively investing in food and beverage businesses with a health- and sustainability bent, as well.
Powerplant’s plant-centric focus remains unique.The firm has already invested in 8 food and food tech startups including: Hail Merry, REBBL, Thrive Market, Terravia, Hampton Creek, Treasure8, and Juicero.

288,Genovation’s GXE breaks the land speed record for a street-legal all-electric car,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/29/genovations-gxe-breaks-the-land-speed-record-for-a-street-legal-all-electric-car/,2016/07/29,"

You probably aren’t trying to set a land speed record for an all-electric, street legal car, but if you are, I have bad news: The goalposts just got moved further out. Genovation‘s Extreme Electric (GXE) car, which uses a Corvette Z06 chassis with a custom electric drive under the hood, broke its previous record of 186.8 mph by a margin of nearly 20 mph. The new record now stands at 205.6 mph.
That’s fast. How fast? Well, not quite as fast as the fastest gas-guzzling legal production vehicle, which is the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super Sport which maxed out at 258 mph. But the GX’s record-breaking run at Kennedy Space Center’s Shuttle Landing Facility is an important milestone for something that employs entirely electric power.
The GXE isn’t exactly a mass-market vehicle, of course. Even though it can technically drive on the streets, you’ll need at least $300,000 to pick one up. But the performance overall might surprise you – I was expecting little to no range, but the vehicle’s 44-kWh battery will provide around 120 miles of range, provided you’re driving normally and aren’t, say, trying to break a land-speed record.

289,Hanergy to build solar-powered electric cars,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/28/hanergy-to-build-solar-powered-electric-cars/,2016/07/28,"
It used to be that only car companies could build cars. But this is the twenty-first century, when seemingly anyone can build a car or four, including a Chinese solar power company. Hanergy Holding Group, which manufactures thin-film solar panels, has created a Solar Vehicle Business Division that debuted four solar-powered prototypes in Beijing.
In a world where anyone can come up with an idea for a vehicle, few make it all the way to production. Hanergy announced its plans to build solar-powered vehicles last year, but it failed to produce prototypes on schedule, leading industry analysts to doubt its capabilities.
But this summer, Hanergy showcased four running and driving prototypes called the Hanergy Solar O, L, A and R (check that acronym!), each designed for a different use case. All the vehicles are lightweight and covered as much as practical in flexible thin-film solar cells. According to a press release, the cells will generate 8 to 10 kWh of energy with 5 to 6 hours of sunlight, which translates to a range of 80 km (50 miles). That range is in the ballpark with several EVs available from major manufacturers, like the Fiat 500e and VW e-Golf.
That’s going to take some serious sunlight conversion, and Hanergy’s current cells have a conversion rate of 31.6 percent, the highest rate of any cells available today. Hanergy expects the rate of its cells to go up to 42 percent in the next decade, which would be enough to power a car entirely with sunlight. In the meantime, you can plug a Hanergy car in and charge the lithium-ion batteries like any other EV for an expected total range, solar and plug combined, of more than 200 miles.
Hanergy isn’t the only company working to integrate electric vehicles with zero-emissions solar charging. You may have heard of Tesla and SolarCity. If you’ve been following automotive news for a while, you may remember the Fisker Karma, which at the 2009 Detroit auto show had a prototype vehicle with solar cells on the roof (that company went bankrupt in 2013 and is being rebooted as Karma Automotive). And in 2014, the Toyota Prius was available with solar panels on the moon roof that powered a remote air conditioning system to cool the car before you got into it.

290,Ford and MIT project provides on-demand electric shuttles for students,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/27/ford-and-mit-project-provides-on-demand-electric-shuttles-for-students/,2016/07/27,"
Ford is working with MIT on a research project that will deploy a new fleet of on-demand electric shuttles that can ferry students from class-to-class both on campus and on city roads at MIT’s Cambridge, Mass. location. Students can hail one of three electric shuttles using an app on their smartphone, and a driver will arrive quickly to pick them up. The research projects hopes to shed light on pedestrian traffic patterns, using LiDAR and other sensors combined with data including weather info and class schedules to optimize the on-demand service.
In addition to helping Ford improve its Dynamic Shuttle project, which currently operates fearing shuttles to employees at the car company’s Dearborn, Michigan campus, the collaboration with MIT will help with Ford’s general aim of exploring different kinds of future transportation under the Ford Smart Mobility umbrella. Specifically, though Ford is also looking to this phase of the project to examine how it can improve detection of pedestrians using lower resolution LiDAR systems than are currently employed in most LiDAR-equipped cars on the road.
“The autonomous vehicles that we use today use LiDAR, and it’s likely that autonomous vehicles in the future will use LiDAR,” explained Bryan Goodman, Ford’s Manger and Technical Leader of Autonomous Vehicle Analysis and the project lead on this MIT engagement in an interview. “This program is gathering good information, and experimenting with various ways to use less resolution in LiDAR to detect pedestrians than some of the LiDAR units we use today.”
Graduate student Justin Miller and undergrad Wally Wibowo of the Aerospace Controls Lab working on vehicles outfitted with sensors that match those of self-driving cars. This work is part of the Ford-MIT Alliance and aims to predict pedestrian behaviors on short time-scales while also providing data to support a mobility-on-demand system for the MIT campus. William Litant/MIT
Getting better results from lower-resolution LiDAR systems has a number of potential advantages, including making hybrid self-driving tech less dependant on supplemental info provided by cameras, and potentially reducing the cost of production of self-driving vehicles, which would make producing them at-scale more viable for car makers and using them more affordable for car owners or passengers in a shared system. This research project provides a safe way to test lower resolution hardware since a driver remains in control and the environment is more controlled than a city roadway, while still providing the benefits of a real-wold testing ground.
The project is also looking to make the most of the resources available in terms of providing good car-sharing service to students actually using the shuttles. To that end, data about trips is gathered and then shared back to the research team for analysis, which is then used to optimize pick-ups, trip routes and drop-offs.
Goodman says that data is being analyzed to accurately predict demand, which processed by algorithms that try to identify the best places for the shuttles to be positioned to maximize customer service. These locations are then fed back to drivers to inform their driving routine, and the process continues cyclically to try to achieve the best possible results regardless of time of day, weather conditions or other variables.
Goodman said that the current phase of the project is scheduled to run through the end of this year, but MIT and Ford are already working on what the next phase or phases might look like. One of the next steps, he says, will be to replace the driver-operated electric shuttles (which Ford terms “mobility-on-demand” or MOD vehicles) with fully autonomous versions, and the data and learning acquired during this phase will be key to achieving that goal.

291,Mercedes-Benz shows off the first fully electric heavy urban transport truck,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/27/mercedes-benz-shows-off-the-first-fully-electric-heavy-urban-transport-truck/,2016/07/27,"
Daimler isn’t about to let Tesla own any more ‘firsts’ in electric transportation; the German company revealed the Mercedes-Benz Urban eTruck today in Stuttgart, an all-electric truck with a total admissible weight capacity of 26 tonnes (29 U.S. tons), which makes it the first clean energy big rig of its kind.
As the name implies, it’s designed for use in urban environments, capping off the short-sprint end of the heavy transport shipping cycle. That’s in part due to its max range of 200 kilometres (about 124 miles). The prototype Urban eTruck is ready for its close-up, but Daimler notes that we’ll have to wait until a “conceivable” launch window of “the beginning of the next decade” for wide-scale production and real-world use.
Still, Daimler beat Tesla to the punch with this reveal, since Tesla CEO Elon Musk only last week that the company is working on an electric Tesla Semi transport truck, with a reveal planned for as early as next year. And Daimler’s not just sitting around waiting for the future launch of its big rig; the same Fuso Canter E-Cell tech it hopes to employ in the Urban eTruck are already in use in a light distribution truck with a 6-tonne (around 7 tons) max capacity, which is currently in testing with customers, including European courier company Hermes.

 
In addition to emissions and environmental benefits, use of vehicles like the Urban eTruck have an immediate upside for city-dwellers: reduced noise. Anyone who’s ever been near a large truck when it trundled down a city street, gearing up from a stop at a traffic light, knows the absolute pain of hearing that huge chugging internal combustion engine wrestling with getting up to a pacing speed.
Scaled production of the Urban eTruck seems not to rest on too many tech hurdles any more – Daimler praises the progress of the drive component that powers the vehicle – but what is limiting larger runs is likely the cost-to-efficiency ratio. Daimler says in a press release that it anticipates prices for its batteries to have dropped by a factor of 2.5 between 1997 and 2025, while battery performance will have increased in the same proportion.

292,Solar Impulse 2 touches down in Abu Dhabi to complete its round-the-world trip,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/26/solar-impulse-2-end/,2016/07/26,"
Four continents, 24,800 miles, and more than 500 days later, Bertrand Piccard and Andre Borschberg are back where they started. The pair of Swiss pilots completed their round-the-world tour in the Solar Impulse 2 today, landing in Abu Dhabi early this morning.
The multiple record-breaking trip was completed without any fuel, trading off flying duties for the journey, which lasted a total of 17 legs, the final taking off from Cairo over the weekend. Among the pair’s impressive feats was completing the longest solo flight (from Japan to Hawaii) and crossing the Atlantic fuel-free.

The plane moved at an average speed of 46 miles per hour and the duo experienced a series of setbacks both mechanical and human, including stomach problems that delayed the last portion. The pilots had to sleep for 20 minute intervals and relieve themselves in their seat, unable to leave the tiny cockpit during flight.
After touching down, Piccard addressed the crowd with a statement of hopefulness. “The future is clean,” he said to applause. “The future is you. The future is now. Let’s take it further.

The last leg of the journey is anticipated to take around 48 hours, at which point pilots Bertrand Piccard and Andre Borschberg will have flown a total of 21,748 miles, marking the first such journey for an aircraft of its kind.

Of course, the plane and its pilots are already in the record books a few times over, having secured the record for the longest solo flight (from Japan to Hawaii) and crossed the Atlantic, both fuel-free.
The pilots anticipate relatively smooth sailing as Piccard takes control one final time. Though, according to the BBC, the hot, thin air above the region could pose some troubles to the solar plane’s motors. A series of delays have pushed back the flight over the year, including, most recently, a bout with an upset stomach that delay the initial July 18th takeoff of this last leg.

Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler intends to up its spending on research and development, the company revealed during its quarterly earnings call on Thursday. The high-end car maker is going to route a lot more money toward areas key to the future of driving, including autonomous driving tech, a brand new generation of batteries for electric vehicles and alternative drive systems.
Daimler’s CEO Dieter Zetsche said the company is “adjusting” their plan in the electric car field, a change in strategy that reflects increased investment from Audi, as well as Tesla’s quick rise to becoming a kind of high-end electric brand cachet. While Zetsche didn’t put a number on spending into either electric, or into R&D efforts in general, he did say that spending on R&D for 2016 would be “significantly” higher than 2015’s roughly $7.3 billion spent.
Already, Daimler’s Mercedes unit is making impressive strides: The company revealed a milestone 12-mile unassisted trip for its autonomous buses, navigating city streets and freeways on a route from an Amsterdam airport to a neighboring town.

295,"Inkbox’s short-term tattoos raise $1M from Alison Sweeney, Jeff Probst and more",https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/21/inkbox-two-week-tattoo-seed-funding/,2016/07/21,"
Inkbox’s two-week tattoos made waves when the company debuted its product on Kickstarter last year – Toronto-based founders Tyler and Braden Handley raised nearly $300,000 for their organic limited-time body art invention, which was a refinement of their original product offering that cut application time to just 10 minutes. A year later, they’ve raised $1 million in seed funding – from a list of angels that includes some familiar names.
Emmy-nominated actress Alison Sweeney, who counts The Biggest Loser and Days of Our Lives among her acting credits, is an inkbox investor. So, too, is Jeff Probst, another reality TV show host, who has been the face of Survivor since it first debuted in 2000.  Both investors were specifically attracted to inkbox’s premise of providing people with the creative expressive capabilities of body art without the commitment; So much so, in fact, that Probst made inkbox his first ever investment in a tech startup.
“Since investing is not my expertise I definitely have to be very connected to the product or the idea,” Probst explained via email. “I also seek council from friends who are experienced investors. Inkbox checked every box. I was very inspired by the idea and very impressed with the people behind it.”
“To tattoo or not tattoo is a common question among my group of friends,” Probst said about inkbox’s personal appeal. “We all love the idea of self-expression but many are reluctant to commit to a tattoo for life. There have been so many times while shooting SURVIVOR that I would’ve tattooed myself to commemorate a moment or to be part of the culture I was living with but the idea of it being for life stopped me. I’ve been dreaming about a short-term tattoo for years and when I heard about iInbox I was immediately intrigued.”
And for Sweeney, this isn’t the first seed investment she’s participated in, but the belief in the product and the concept behind it is just as strong.
“I love the idea of expressing oneself in all ways, especially when they can change with time rather than being permanent,” Sweeney told me via email. “When I learned about inkbox and started to talk with Tyler about his vision for the company, I was excited to join the team and be part of the movement.”
The team Tyler and inkbox have assembled is key to the company’s future, and none maybe more so than the company’s first main hire, Chris Caputo, who was doing a postdoc at Harvard when inkbox hired him five months ago, and one of Canada’s most promising young chemists. That leadership hire, as well as this round, were based on inkbox’s assertion that this is just their first product. in fact, Handley tells me that they’re currently working on a version of their temporary tattoo tech that lasts 30 days, and that’s just the start.

“We consider our company first and foremost a biotech company on the back end, and we have a consumer front-end that sells a fashion accessory,” Handley explained. “And it makes it quite challenging to find the right talent, because how do you hire a software developer to work on a product like this?”
Hiring hasn’t been the young startup’s only challenge: Handley says that because of how new the tech behind the product is, they’ve had to “manufacture it from scratch,” so going from prototype and the foundational, tested science to something that could be manufactured at the scale that a consumer product required took at least six months, culminating in a general consumer launch last week.
Temporary tattoos may not initially seem like a high-tech product, but inkbox already has strong scientific talent on its side with Caputo, and this new round from angels including Sweeney, Probst, Marc Bell, Joe Roos and Chicago-based early-stage VC firm KGC Capital. With retail sales on the horizon, and more products in the pipeline, it’s an interesting company to watch in the world of natural science.

296,The 7 steps of Elon Musk’s “Master Plan”,https://techcrunch.com/gallery/dr-elon/,gallery/dr,CONTENT ERROR

The Tesla “Master Plan Part Deux” published tonight by founder Elon Musk proposes numerous major projects, but perhaps the most far-reaching of them all is the plan to put solar panels on every house and a battery in every garage. And to do that, he not-so-subtly hints, Tesla and SolarCity will need to be more than friends.
“We need to combine and break down the barriers inherent to being separate companies,” Musk wrote. “That they are separate at all, despite similar origins and pursuit of the same overarching goal of sustainable energy, is largely an accident of history.”
That rather overstates it, of course, and he largely undercuts that position with the next sentence, which implies that both companies are only just now arriving at a position to work with one another.

All the same, it’s clearly a plea to the shareholders and investors who are skeptical of the financial alchemy by which combining two debts will produce a profit. They may not see as far as Musk does, but his long-distance vision seems to blind him to the difficulties right under his nose. What he and the others at Tesla have built is remarkable, but he only sees it as the beginning of a much longer journey, and there are plenty of people who’d like to get off — or at least take a breather.
Even the ones who share Musk’s faith must surely want a few more specifics when it comes to next steps. I mean, here’s his pitch:
“Create a smoothly integrated and beautiful solar-roof-with-battery product that just works, empowering the individual as their own utility, and then scale that throughout the world. One ordering experience, one installation, one service contact, one phone app.”
Sounds great, except each single aspect of that so-called plan is more than enough to fill any sane company’s plate! It’s an admirable goal, of course, and I don’t doubt the companies are capable of bringing it off in time. But it doesn’t make much of a case for the proposed acquisition — here, today. (Of course a more detailed plan has surely circulated internally, but if it were much more fleshed out than this, Musk is the type to say so.)
Not everyone moves at the speed of Musk, which is no doubt endlessly frustrating to him. But his numerous and glittering successes should comfort him in his frustration. It’s unlikely that anything he has built will go to waste (the Hyperloop, perhaps, but mostly because he didn’t build it), but he’ll need to do more than dream out loud if he wants Tesla’s weary backers to follow his lead.

298,Elon Musk reveals Tesla’s master plan,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/20/teslas-master-plan-part-two-is-huge-for-the-company/,2016/07/20,"
Elon Musk plans to steer Tesla towards fully autonomous driving, car sharing, and cargo transport, according to the long awaited blog post on the company’s website. A fully solar power ecosystem driven in-part by SolarCity will help Musk and Co. get there.
Musk has been teasing the master plan part II for days. What would be in it? Would Tesla cars fly? Would they go to space? What does Lana Del Rey have to do with it? Why is Elon Musk talking about crack on Twitter?
After a near infinite number of browser refreshes, we now know.
For a quick breakdown, check out our gallery: The 7 steps of Elon Musk’s “Master Plan”
Tesla is doubling down on not just autopilot but full autonomy. To get there, Musk expects a total of 6 billion miles of test-driving will be needed. Right now, fleet learning is happening at 3 million miles per day.
Tesla is also prioritizing development of heavy-duty trucks and high passenger-density urban transport. These products will be unveiled over the next year. The Tesla Semi specifically will support cargo and transportation services. The driver role is expected to transition to one of a fleet manager. A Tesla ecosystem of smaller connected utility vehicles including busses would be able to provide convenience, increase road safety and reduce traffic congestion. Such a system benefits everyone, not just the technocratic elite. Additional capacity, door-to-door service, and non-cellular methods to interact with the system would benefit groups yet to be touched by traditional ride-sharing.
The company is taking a page from Uber and Lyft and raising them with artificial intelligence. Tesla sees itself taking on qualities of a transportation company but rather than a human driver, Tesla will come to you autonomously. To supplement an early lack of supply in vehicles, the company will operate a fleet of its own.
“You will also be able to add your car to the Tesla shared fleet just by tapping a button on the Tesla phone app and have it generate income for you while you’re at work or on vacation, significantly offsetting and at times potentially exceeding the monthly loan or lease cost,” said Musk in his post. “This dramatically lowers the true cost of ownership to the point where almost anyone could own a Tesla. Since most cars are only in use by their owner for 5% to 10% of the day, the fundamental economic utility of a true self-driving car is likely to be several times that of a car which is not.”
Pushing to bring down costs for the average consumer appears central to the new plan. Like Ford before him, Musk is prioritizing manufacturing optimization to bring costs down in the upcoming Model 3 and forthcoming vehicles.
In line with Tesla’s updated goals, the company quietly changed its URL earlier this week from Teslamotors.com to just Tesla.com. Tesla is no-longer simply a car company.
Even before the URL change, Musk had been hinting at this shift. In the first part of the master plan released in 2006, Musk described that his draw to the company was a desire “to help expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy.”
Musk deliberately said solar, not wind or hydroelectric, but solar.
Even on this alone, a Tesla acquisition of SolarCity could have been predicted. Musk expanded on his ideas to include a roadmap that has guided the company for a decade.
√ Build sports car
√ Use that money to build an affordable car
√ Use that money to build an even more affordable car
√ While doing above, also provide zero emission electric power generation options
Tesla has done a pretty good job at first targeting customers “prepared to pay a premium,” and then “driving down the market.” The new plan picks up where the old one left off and provides guidance on how electric power can move beyond the car and into the home.

Batteries were a small part of Musk’s plan but have grown to be a major focal point of the business. The new plan is to coalesce all of energy generation and storage around a single ordering and installation process. This means Tesla batteries are entering a long term intimate relationship with SolarCity solar panels.
The new plan, focuses on the solar ecosystem as a whole. Lot of new artificial intelligence and machine learning technology has rolled into place over the last decade and Tesla wants to take advantage of that as well.
The new simplified plan looks like this:
Ο Create stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage
Ο Expand the electric vehicle product line to address all major segments
Ο Develop a self-driving capability that is 10X safer than manual via massive fleet learning
Ο Enable your car to make money for you when you aren’t using it
Tesla investors have been patient so far, but that was called into question amidst Tesla’s plans to acquire SolarCity. The company’s stock is worth 13 times its IPO value, but lately has been categorized as a risky investment by analysts. Dreaming big is easier as a startup. The larger a company grows, the harder it becomes to steer the rudder. I’m not one to doubt Musk, and given how accurately he forecasted and accomplished his last plan, others would be wise not to either.

DeepMind may be a master at one of the most complex games on Earth, but can it handle the day-to-day energy concerns of a Google data center? Yes, as it turns out, and with a vengeance.
The power needs of a data center depend on lots of factors, from demand to the weather, and adjusting to or predicting these variables in order to achieve maximal power efficiency can be difficult indeed. Google has been applying machine learning to the problem, building a neural model with which its AI can keep all these factors in mind, so to speak.
The researchers finally let DeepMind loose on a live data center — and the results were immediately validating. Overall energy use for cooling dropped 40 percent and stayed there.

Google is already fairly concerned with energy use, having taken many steps toward using renewable power and keeping things efficient. So it’s not like no one was paying attention to begin with. The streamlining DeepMind did could also be generalized to other systems and deployed to other data centers — which the company will surely crow about when it comes to pass.
The DeepMind team plans to publish a more comprehensive description of their work in an actual paper; we’ll add a link when we see it.

300,"Car sharing leads to reduced car ownership and emissions in cities, study finds",https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/19/car-sharing-leads-to-reduced-car-ownership-and-emissions-in-cities-study-finds/,2016/07/19,"
Cars are one of the top contributors to greenhouse gas emissions globally, and cars in cities can be especially heavy with their contributions, owing to traffic and population density. And while encouraging everyone to bike or use public transit probably isn’t going to convince everyone to ditch car ownership, car sharing services seem to be winning more city denizens over, and a new study shows that the results of said services are good, both for the environment and for reducing unnecessary personal budget burdens.
The study (full PDF available here), conducted by research group Innovative Mobility Research (IMR) working out of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at UC Berkeley, looked specifically at one-way car sharing in North America, with a focus on car2go since it has the largest reach and is present in a number of major urban markets. With one-way car sharing, members of the service can pick up a car at one spot and drop it at another — here in Toronto, for instance, car2go vehicles can be picked up on city streets, in city-run “Green P” parking lots and at the airport.
The IMR’s study focused on car2go members in Calgary, San Diego, Seattle, Vancouver and Washington, and relies on self-reported info derived from polling car2go users, combined with vehicle activity data provided by car2go for the purposes of the study.
What they found was that both vehicle ownership and emissions from driving dropped as a result of car sharing programs being present in these cities. Reduced emissions are a reflection of reduced driving overall, as car2go members seem not to use cars as much as car owners, despite using public transportation just as much or even less than before car sharing was introduced. In the vast majority of cases, however, respondents reported walking more.
In terms of ownership, the survey found that a small but non-trivial number of respondents either sold or didn’t bother to buy a personal vehicle as a result of having a one-way car sharing system in place. In total across all five cities, the study suggests that between four and nine owned vehicles were suppressed (i.e. sold or never purchased to begin with) per car sharing vehicle present in the city. That represents a huge shift in the total number of vehicles on the road, and the resulting cost from a manufacturing, ownership/usage and disposal perspective, if accurate.
Anecdotally, car2go has done well here in Toronto. In addition to expanding pick-up/drop-off points from just parking lots to any residential street, it has added four-door Mercedes vehicles to its fleet (in addition to the standard smart fortwos that make up the bulk of its offerings). I’ve heard from a fellow TechCrunch writer that, again anecdotally, car2go has also become pretty commonplace in Seattle.
Car sharing is still far from being the norm among city-dwellers when it comes to transportation options, but this study shows that even modest membership numbers could have big impact on the health of a city.

301,More EVs—and more kinds of EVs—are expected to be sold this year,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/12/more-evs-and-more-kinds-of-evs-are-expected-to-be-sold-this-year/,2016/07/12,"
If it seems like EVs are everywhere, you’re closer to being right this year than ever before. Navigant Research expects the EV market to grow 62% year over year in 2016, which adds up to nearly 200,000 EVs being sold this year.
Navigant points to long-range battery electric vehicles (BEVs) with price tags under $40,000, like the Chevy Bolt ($37,000 MSRP) that’s expected to hit dealerships in the fall, as being key to this growth. A press release also mentions the Tesla Model X, the latest Chevy Volt, the Prius Prime plug-in hybrid (PHEV), and the forthcoming Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV as driving the trend, pun definitely intended.
For the past five years or so, EVs have gotten a bit more of a market share on the West Coast. Navigant says the growth is going to come in the Northeast. Manufacturers are going to need to ramp up marketing to hit targets in several New England states, including Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Vermont, that have joined California in an effort to get more zero-emissions cars on the road by 2025.
It may be easier for consumers to find an EV that works for them as ranges get longer, prices drop, and more kinds of EVs become available. That’s getting a bit easier, according to the Department of Energy. In 2015, there were EVs available in 9 different classes, from two-seaters to standard-sized SUVs. More than half, 60%, of all the plug-in electric vehicles sold last year were midsize or large cars, like the Nissan Leaf and Tesla Model S.
Navigant and the DOE agree that the market for plug-in electric vehicles effectively began in 2011, when there was a whopping four models available. (Here’s a note for trivia night: The DOE does not list a Tesla as being available in 2011. The company had stopped taking orders for the Roadster and had not yet started production on the Model S at that point.) Now, there are 29, from the all-electric Fiat 500e to the Volvo XC90 Plug-in Hybrid.
Sales since 2011 have grown from about 20,000 to 120,000, which is a six-fold jump, but it still accounts for fewer than 1% of all vehicle sales in the US. Navigant’s predictions for 2016 could take EVs over that hurdle.

302,"Tesla under investigation for possible breach of securities law, WSJ reports",https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/11/tesla-under-investigation-for-possible-breach-of-securities-law-wsj-reports/,2016/07/11,"
Tesla is under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, The Wall Street Journal reported, for a possible securities law breach.
What’s at issue is whether the electric vehicle company should have notified shareholders immediately following a fatal accident on May 7 that killed a Tesla Model S owner who was using Autopilot at the time of the crash.
A spokesperson for Tesla said that the car company has not yet heard from the SEC regarding this matter.
As TechCrunch previously reported, multiple state and federal investigations are ongoing, and it is not yet clear if Tesla’s Autopilot features contributed to or caused the fatal accident in any way.
Laymen call Autopilot “self-driving” technology, and the company refers to this system as a “driver assistance system.” Numerous Tesla fan communities online share videos of drivers using Autopilot in a hands-free mode despite the company advising them against this.
Among agencies investigating the fatal Tesla Autopilot crash are the National Transportation Safety Board, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Florida Highway Patrol.
A non-fatal but also serious crash that followed on July 1 in Pennsylvania has contributed to heightened scrutiny of Tesla’s technology, shareholder dealings and stock performance.
The July crash involved a 2016 Model X SUV, and a driver who was also using Autopilot features. The driver was charged with careless driving by Pennsylvania State Police.
In the car company’s blog, Tesla defended itself against implications by Fortune magazine that it had misled its investors about risks associated with its business and, specifically, Autopilot technology.
Tesla did not disclose any information about the fatal accident to the public until June 30 with a blog post called “A Tragic Loss,” even though the crash took place in early May.
It remains to be seen whether the company has violated financial or other regulations in delaying discussion of that, or any other accidents involving their cars.
To-date, Tesla has not been sued for product liability. However, the family of Joshua Brown, the Tesla enthusiast killed in the Florida crash, has retained the services of a well-known personal injury law firm.

303,Yoshi launches “set it and forget it” vehicle re-fueling service in San Francisco,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/11/yoshi-launches-set-it-and-forget-it-vehicle-re-fueling-service-in-san-francisco/,2016/07/11,"
A startup called Yoshi Inc. is the latest to give drivers a way to fuel up without going to the gas station.
The company has officially launched its gas delivery service in the San Francisco Bay Area, and is offering other simple services like filling up the air in a car’s tires, replacing windshield wiper blades and washing cars, as well.
Sound familiar? Yoshi is not the only company to attempt to reach drivers where they park with a mobile app for booking.
Gas-delivering competitors in the U.S. include: Filld, WeFuel, Purple, Booster Fuels and GasNinjas. There also are international upstarts playing in the space, like FueledUp in Lagos, Nigeria.
Rather than delivering “on-demand,” Yoshi users schedule refueling one time, typically at a place of work where they park for hours during the day without needing their vehicle.
Then, they authorize the startup to sense when their vehicle is nearby and come gas it up as needed.
This “set it and forget it” approach allows Yoshi to optimize their delivery routes, explains CEO and co-founder Nick Alexander.

The company has engineered its own gas delivery trucks with a proprietary system, called the Fuel Vault, which allows Yoshi to access any car’s tank, even if the gas flap is locked.
With questions lingering about the safety and legality of fuel delivery direct to vehicles, Alexander said Yoshi is approaching relevant local regulators, and especially fire departments, in each market where it begins fuel delivery.
“There are a lot of rules to follow, but they’re not as fragmented state by state as you would think,” the CEO said.
The company is already profitable, with business beyond the San Francisco Bay Area, in Nashville, Tennessee and Atlanta, Georgia.
Yoshi has raised $120,000 in seed funding and is currently participating in Y Combinator in Silicon Valley. The CEO declined to comment on further fundraising activity.
Generally, Yoshi costs drivers $15 per month for a subscription, plus the cost of regular or premium gas, or other supplies like new windshield wiper blades. Yoshi also has a partnership with Firestone, which allows customers to buy new tires and book a tire change through Yoshi.
The company also works to fuel fleets, and establishes prices ad hoc with its clients.
In addition to using its seed funding to roll out to new markets, Yoshi plans to develop technology to keep pace with vehicle technology; for example, to deliver a rapid charge to electric vehicles, or hydrogen or biodiesel, Alexander said.
Today, the company’s fuel-delivery drivers are 1099 contractors, but the company is exploring other options, like hiring delivery drivers as W2 part-time staff or full-time employees in different markets.

304,Hyperloop One proposes half-hour travel time between Helsinki and Stockholm,https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/06/hyperloop-one-helsinki-to-stockholm/,2016/07/06,"
Shervin Pishevar’s Hyperloop One recorded another first today, though not one as exciting as making a hunk of metal go really fast in the desert – it created a business case.
The business case (via Gizmodo), created in partnership with engineering firm partners and consulting firm KPMG, is meant to walk potential investors through the value proposition inherent in a proposed Hyperloop route connecting Helsinki and Stockholm. Hyperloop One leads the slide deck with the money slide combo: a before-and-after showing current travel times of three hours, thirty minutes (including travel time to/from airport, giving yourself a decent window so as not to miss the plane, etc.) by air, vs. a total trip time of 28 minutes for the proposed Hyperloop installation.

Hyperloop, if you aren’t yet familiar, is the transit technology conceived by Elon Musk that uses pods in tightly controlled, tube-contained environments to reduce speed-limiting factors including friction and air resistance to propel the vehicles at super speeds. Musk came up with the idea, but cited a lack of available time as the reason he couldn’t pursue it himself.
Pishevar’s Hyperloop One was one of the companies that took up the cause. It has had some recent successes, including a limited but technically impressive test in the Nevada desert in May, and an $80 million raise and name improvement around the same time. Recently, however, the startup experienced a considerable executive-level shakeup that saw the departure of CTO and co-founder Brogan BamBrogan.
Of course, the business case they created doesn’t go into executive details – but it does talk about cost, which is estimated at just over $21 billion. But with an annual projected profit of around $885 million, it wouldn’t take that long to recoup that investment, speaking in the relative terms of expensive international transportation projects.
Beyond all the financial estimates and business justifications, what this proposal does is put in stark relief the contraction of space that a Hyperloop network might one day be able to offer. Trips that were once an ordeal become less inconvenient than the average daily commute; provided ticket prices don’t negate the economic benefit, the definition of an urban space could be reconfigured as a result.
If Hyperloop One can even approximate what’s contained in this proposal, we might have to rethink altogether what we mean when we say the word “city.”

305,Modern Meadow raises $40 million to grow leather without livestock,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/28/modern-meadow-raises-40-million-to-grow-leather-without-livestock/,2016/06/28,"
A Brooklyn-based startup called Modern Meadow has raised $40 million to become a top source of leather for the world’s makers of fashion and accessories, luggage, sporting goods, upholstery and furniture.
Rather than raising animals to slaughter them and take the skin off their backs in a physically and chemically intensive process, Modern Meadow “biofabricates” its leather in labs and foundries.
Modern Meadow CEO and co-founder Andras Forgacs explains that biofabrication involves the design of cells to produce and assemble collagen and other proteins to yield leather that is “biologically identical” to traditional types.
Biofabrication is environmentally beneficial, he believes. He said, “We’re making a material that has no hair flesh or fat on it. So the liming and toxicity you see elsewhere in the leather trade is eliminated.”
Chief Creative Officer for Modern Meadow, Suzanne Lee, said the company’s processes can generate leather that’s made to a designer’s specifications and imbued with desirable traits like a certain flexibility, elasticity, thinness or thickness.
Once produced, the leathers can go to a tannery for additional dyeing, she noted.
Horizons Ventures, an equity investing vehicle for Li Ka-shing, and Iconiq Capital led Modern Meadow’s Series B round, joined by ARTIS Ventures, Temasek, Breakout Ventures, Red Swan Ventures, Collaborative Fund and Tony Faddell, the inventor, designer and founder of Nest Labs.
The funding brings Modern Meadow’s total capital raised to $53.5 million to-date.
Modern Meadow is using synthetic biology to grow leather in labs, not from livestock.
Forgacs said the company intends to use the funding to move beyond research and development into a “scale up” phase which will include the expansion of its lab and design studio in New York, and the establishment of its first foundry or factory, as well as continued hiring.
Horizons Ventures’ Bart Swanson said his firm re-upped their investment in Modern Meadow, in part, because the company had managed to attract tech talent in a competitive market, and advanced their technology enough to yield promising leather samples.
In September last year, Modern Meadow managed to poach DuPont’s chief of staff for the chief science and technology officer, Dave Williamson, as their CTO.
“Now that we can sit there and play with these materials, we can imagine moving from the laboratory into full-scale production,” Swanson said. “It’s not theoretical.”
One main challenge Modern Meadow still faces will be to make its biofabricated leather not just an attractive option but an affordable one for the mass market, the investor and company executives acknowledged.
Swanson compared Modern Meadow’s ambitions to that of the most successful clean tech companies from an earlier wave of innovation and investing. “It took us a long time to rid ourselves of total dependence on oil and carbon fuels, now renewable energy, LED lighting and electric vehicles have traction,” Swanson said.
According to forecasts from Research and Markets, sales of leather goods–including luggage, apparel and accessories–are expected to hit $91.2 billion globally by 2018.
Modern Meadow wants to win a material share of this massive market for leather, and even grow it, by offering an appealing alternative to the natural and synthetic options that exist today, Forgacs said.
Corrections & clarifications: Modern Meadow designs cells that assemble collagen.

306,Used BMW i batteries store solar power at home,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/23/used-bmw-i-batteries-store-solar-power-at-home/,2016/06/23,"
BMW i joins Tesla and Mercedes-Benz in bringing energy storage home with its new system, which has yet to be given a catchy name. The system uses new or used batteries from the BMW i3 electric car to store power from solar panels for later use. It integrates with the charging station users are likely to have in the garage, so the stored energy from the sun can power your i3 overnight.
Basically, if you keep your i3 long enough that the battery outlives its useful lifespan as a power source for your car, you can recycle it yourself. This system is plug-and-play, according to BMW’s press release, so you can use the battery’s remaining storage power in the stationary system after you get a replacement battery for the car.
BMW i is also anticipating the near-future availability of second-life batteries, which would be retired batteries from other people’s i3 cars. Because the i3 has only been in production since 2013 (as a 2014 model year), there’s going to be several years of lag time before those batteries are ready to be recycled for in-home storage. But early batteries used in the Mini E test fleet have already been installed in a similar capacity at the University of San Diego, and energy distributor NextEra has already signed a contract for 20 MWh of second-life batteries, the largest order of used automotive batteries so far.
The BMW i lithium-ion battery has a capacity of 22 kWh or 33 kWh. The company says that’s enough to power a typical American household, which uses 15-30 kWh day, for up to 24 hours. The BMW Group Technology Office is partnering with Pacific Gas & Electric Company and i3 owners in California to study how home energy storage and charge management can lower the overall cost of EV ownership. The study allows BMW to delay or interrupt charging during peak times, so if range anxiety is one of your EV issues, this might not be the study for you.

307,Tesla gets more than solar panels with offer to acquire SolarCity,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/21/tesla-gets-more-than-solar-panels-with-offer-to-acquire-solarcity/,2016/06/21,"
News of an offer from Tesla to acquire SolarCity came mostly unexpected to traders earlier this afternoon. In a rapid “knee-jerk” reaction, traders bid up SolarCity by 13 percent and sent Tesla tumbling down 12 percent.

Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) Stock Price | FindTheCompany

It is typical for the stock of an acquisition target to spike while the acquirer’s stock falls according to Michael Morosi of Avondale Partners.
SolarCity has a debt-to-equity ratio of 3.492 as of March 2016. Tesla has a ratio of 3.215 as of the same date.
Tesla is in a unique position as an automaker because its market is still largely undeveloped. Competitors in the space like Fiat Chrysler and General Motors have much lower ratios in the ballpark of 1.6 and 1.7 respectively. Ford is a notable exception, but for the most part, Tesla has an elevated debt to equity ratio.
The good news for Tesla is that most of the debt held by SolarCity is project-level debt. Morosi noted that such debt is consolidated on the SolarCity balance sheet but is all set against cash flow producing assets. This means the debt behaves much more like mortgage debt than credit card debt.
SolarCity does have an outstanding convertible note and it is out-of-the-money, added Morosi. SolarCity also has a highly visible burn-rate and has yet to achieve cash-flow breakeven. Tesla will have to attend to SolarCity’s debt and cash-flow as the deal gets closer to reality.
Tesla and SolarCity have long been intertwined companies. Elon Musk and Antonio Gracias have both recused themselves from any decision-making on the acquisition given their overlapping roles in the two companies.
Morosi added that an acquisition of SolarCity will complicate Tesla’s financial reporting. SolarCity can only recognize a fraction of its yearly revenue from a GAAP perspective which could reflect poorly on Tesla’s side. It’s also going to be harder to separate growth of the company’s core automotive business from more speculative investments in the future of energy.
The generous 21 percent to 30 percent premium that Tesla offered to SolarCity has largely been erased by markets. If that deal was made based on the current price of SolarCity stock, the premium would be closer to 8 percent and 15 percent.

Solarcity Corporation (SCTY) Stock Price | FindTheCompany

Most analysts expect SolarCity to continue operating as normal even after the transaction date. Tesla largely has its hands full with the rollout of the Tesla Model 3. The role of SolarCity in the Tesla ecosystem will ultimately be a play for the future.
There is also agreement that the Tesla move is bold. Tesla is still four years away from its target to hit full capacity at its lithium-ion Gigafactory. More details over time should help ease worries that Tesla acted too brashly with the acquisition. The decision could be as simple as seeing a good price and taking the opportunity regardless of timing.
“Tesla doesn’t view this as a reaction to GE breathing down their necks,” said Troy Ault, Director of Research at Cleantech Group.
Tesla looks at the battery side as a commodity play added Ault. Tesla is likely hedging a bet toward future battery innovation. Time will tell how it will integrate into vehicle technology.

308,Elon Musk’s Tesla offers to acquire Elon Musk’s SolarCity for $2.8B,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/21/teslacity/,2016/06/21,"
The great Elon Musk empire is uniting. Today his electric car and battery company Tesla announced its offer to acquire his solar panel installation company SolarCity. Together the companies could allow you to outfit your home with solar panels that power a giant battery for everything inside, as well as your electric car.
The deal still has to be approved by SolarCity and its board. If it goes through, it would see SolarCity stock exchanged for Tesla stock. The deal would pay a premium of 21 percent to 30 percent on top of SolarCity’s value of $2.14 billion, so Tesla would be buying SolarCity for between $2.59 billion and $2.78 billion worth of its stock.

SolarCity has been bleeding money
Recently SolarCity had its value downgraded because it’s been bleeding hundreds of millions of dollars, making it an easier acquisition target. SolarCity’s share price skyrocketed 20 percent in after-hours trading as soon as the announcement hit. That means the premium on SolarCity’s value has been instantly cut much smaller in after-hours.
Musk will recuse from voting on the acquisition, as will Tesla and SolarCity board member Antonio Gracias. However, Tesla says it only wants to make the acquisition if it’s friendly, not a hostile take-over.
Is this Musk bailing out Musk?
Tesla’s share price dropped 13 percent in after-hours trading. That’s because some might consider this a bailout of SolarCity, with Musk rescuing his 22.2 percent stake in the company by acquiring it with Tesla. SolarCity’s share price was down from more than $50 in December to around $21 when today’s deal was announced. If it continued to sink, Musk could lose a ton of money. Tesla could build its own solar business or acquire SolarCity’s assets later if it kept sinking, but that would burn hundreds of millions of Musk’s own money first.
The Tesla Powerwall could store energy from your SolarCity solar panels to keep your house powered when there’s no sun
On closer inspection, the synergies between the companies might not pan out. Tesla’s sky-high demand for its vehicles means it doesn’t need much of a sales force, while SolarCity is constantly doing door-to-door and telesales. Everything happens inside Tesla’s factories until the cars ship, while SolarCity has armies of contractors driving around on trucks installing panels.
But Musk is a crafty one and could have plans we can’t foresee.
The only vertically integrated energy company
The Tesla team writes, “It’s now time to complete the picture. Tesla customers can drive clean cars and they can use our battery packs to help consume energy more efficiently, but they still need access to the most sustainable energy source that’s available: the sun.”
Tesla outlined the reasoning behind why the acquisition makes sense:
“We would be the world’s only vertically integrated energy company offering end-to-end clean energy products to our customers. This would start with the car that you drive and the energy that you use to charge it, and would extend to how everything else in your home or business is powered. With your Model S, Model X, or Model 3, your solar panel system, and your Powerwall all in place, you would be able to deploy and consume energy in the most efficient and sustainable way possible, lowering your costs and minimizing your dependence on fossil fuels and the grid.”
Whether or not it’s a fiscally sound deal for each company’s shareholders, it’s certainly bold. A thousand years from now they’re going to be speaking the name “ELON MUSK.”

309,"DIRTT’s ICEreality puts VR to use for interior, office design",https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/17/dirtts-icereality-puts-vr-to-use-for-interior-office-design/,2016/06/17,"
 

A manufacturer of custom prefabricated elements to be built into offices and other work spaces, DIRTT Environmental Solutions is the latest corporation to adopt virtual reality for the enterprise, rather than entertainment.
The company unveiled their ICEreality software this week at an annual construction industry trade show, NeoCon 2016, in Chicago. (Yes, tech news had the audacity to break outside of Apple’s WWDC and the video game industry’s E3 this week.)

DIRTT wants to help architects, developers, facility managers and interior designers create eco-friendly work spaces that are stylish and fit their needs.
Their process starts with creating a digital blueprint, of sorts, within DIRTT’s cloud-based design and planning software, ICE. That’s where ICEreality comes in. The feature, which will be broadly available this fall, is now accessible to a very small number of invited beta users.
ICEreality allows designers, or really any building occupants, to see a real-time video of an existing space that they want to remodel, overlaid with a three-dimensional illustration of elements and objects they want to install.
They can see how a counter, a custom-cut door or new walls, windows, blinds and furniture will look in the space this way.
There’s a video of the demo here, where DIRTT “builds” cabinets and counters on an empty stage. (Skip to about 2:20)
ICEreality translates the digital components of a room so they appear precisely built-to-scale in the video. This gives users a much better sense of how their office will feel once all the new prefabricated components come in, and are installed.
DIRTT’s ICEreality is VR software used for office and interior design.
According to DIRTT co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Barrie Loberg, ICEreality can be used with VR headsets like the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive for a more immersive experience, but it also works on smartphones and tablets.
Because it’s not entirely illustrated or rendered, but isn’t just text and information overlaid on a video, DIRTT insists on calling their technology neither VR nor AR but “mixed reality.”
“We built this to go beyond the 3D walk-through and let people make tweaks to a design in real time. Once they get the environment designed exactly as they want it, they can also place orders for everything they need to get it built, here,” he said.
Better design tools, Loberg hopes, will help the construction industry avoid costly mistakes and change orders that occur when a built environment requires tweaks after materials have already been ordered and installed.

310,A device called the Remo spots a market for automating wall mount air conditioners,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/16/a-device-called-the-remo-spots-a-market-for-automating-wall-mount-air-conditioners/,2016/06/16,"
I’m usually cautious about Kickstarter campaigns, but when the data looks right I’m encouraged to peer deeper. Haruumi Shiode reached out to me with his CleanTech concept for a product called the Remo (which remotely controls wall unit air conditioners), and I have to admit the numbers looked interesting even though this is a business model I would have never considered.
Living here in the Midwest amidst routine central air conditioning and heating, it’s easy to forget that this may not be the experience everyone has.
In fact, according to Shiode, there are fully 1 billion portable air conditioners in the world for room cooling. There are 70 million in the USA and 130 million in Japan. There are 6 million in New York City alone.
Therefore his company, called Nature—which strives to bring harmony between nature and human-made devices—is approaching the air conditioning market with a device to automate wall mount AC use for convenience, monetary savings and environmental benefits. Nature should not be confused with The Nature Co.
It’s been a while since I bought a wall unit AC, but apparently these days most have an infrared remote control (like a TV). The Remo device syncs with the AC unit remote and then essentially becomes a web-connected, location-aware interpreter between the air conditioner and the Remo smartphone app. A special plug is coming soon for legacy AC units that may not have a remote.

The gist of how it works is simple enough; when you are not in your house or apartment, the Remo turns your AC unit off. If you are in your abode (or approaching it) it turns it on.
Bingo. Rooms in your house are cooled down.
You can also remotely change cooling settings and they have built in demand management/peak shaving capabilities so utility companies can get involved. Shiode and his cofounder and CTO Mash Ohtsuka did not reveal planned pricing but say it should be competitive.
I should also mention that Nature plans to provide IFTTT (If This, Then That), and Amazon Alexa integrations.

312,Comfy raises $12 million for app to end office thermostat wars,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/08/comfy-raises-8-million-for-app-to-end-office-thermostat-wars/,2016/06/08,"
Building Robotics Inc., better known as Comfy, raised $12 million in Series B funding for building automation software that helps companies save energy on office air conditioning while gathering employee-contributed data about the use and occupancy of a workspace.
Emergence Capital led the investment, joined by real estate services company CBRE and Microsoft Ventures.
According to company president Lindsay Baker, letting employees tweak the temperature around their cubicle can improve productivity and happiness. “It’s a very real thing that temperature and light can slow us down, distract us, make us hungry or impact our hormones,” she said.
Baker explained that Comfy is a simple-to-use app that employees put on their phones and use to request warm or cool air in a zone where they work. The app uses employee-contributed data, and combines it with usage data and patterns, to tune every zone in an office building based on the routine preferences of people who work in each zone there.
The Oakland, Calif.-based startup faces significant competition from building automation businesses, ranging from other tech startups, including SCIEnergy and BuildingIQ, to large energy management tech vendors like Honeywell International, Johnson Controls or United Technologies.
What sets Comfy apart from the competition, Baker says, is its “occupant facing” mobile app.
Other companies in the space typically build apps and analytics for building managers, or sell sensors and other hardware that is installed and distributed throughout an office to gather data about occupancy and usage, but without individual feedback from employees on their preferences.
Comfy charges its clients based on the square footage of their office, and does not charge to install its system initially.
Emergence Capital founder and General Partner Brian Jacobs said his firm backed Comfy because of its cloud-based and employee-friendly approach to the market.
“We’ve looked at hundreds of companies in building automation and none of them felt like they could be the leader in this market because none of them were getting employees engaged in controlling their own environment,” he said.
The firm learned in working as an early investor in Salesforce, Yammer and others, that “employees will use what they want, “ and “employers only get ROI if employees use the things they invest in,” the investor added.
Comfy will use its funding for hiring, and intends to double from 30 to 60 full-time employees in the next year, Baker said. The company also plans to develop new features and functionality to serve clients in different industries.
“Healthcare facilities require something very different from hotels when it comes to making occupants comfortable, and employees productive,” Baker explained.
Comfy is also exploring ways it could use indoor positioning in its app, so a worker’s temperature and lighting preferences could automatically follow and be set for him or her wherever they go around the office in a day, or be turned off when they leave.

313,Wype will come clean your car where it sits,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/02/wype-will-come-clean-your-car-in-situ/,2016/06/02,"
Recently, I wrote about Wyper, the Tinder of car shopping. That prompted Andy Kim, co-founder of Wype, to contact me. His business is one letter off from Wyper, after all, so in the interest of disambiguation, here’s the scoop on the car-detailing company that is more like Uber than Tinder in the app comparison game.
Wype is based in Southern California, where cars are shiny and water is scarce. Wype detailers arrive at your car armed with non-toxic, plant-based proprietary cleaning products that require no additional water — no hoses, no puddles. According to Kim, the car wash industry wastes 300 million gallons of water, or 38 gallons per car, each day. (Auto Laundry News estimates that car washes use between 35 and 120 gallons per vehicle, depending on wash type.)
Wype was founded in 2014 in Orange County by Kim, Kevin Dawson and former LA Laker Jordan Farmar (who’s currently with the Memphis Grizzlies). Most customers are not pro basketball players, though; they’re males with above-average income and soccer-mom types, all between the ages of 24 and 40. Interestingly, the men tend to call for their cars to be cleaned on weekends, while three-quarters of women request a car detail on weekdays.
No matter the demographic, there are three levels of Wype: the Quickie, which only cleans the exterior and doesn’t require you to give the keys to the detailer; the Standard, which gets the interior and exterior clean; and the Swanky, which adds wax. When they clean the interior, they’ll take out the trash, organize your stuff that isn’t trash and leave you a mint. They also take before and after pictures.
Kim said in an email that no car has yet been too dirty for Wype to handle. “Our process safely and effectively cleans surfaces that haven’t been washed for months,” he wrote. “Now, we’re also lucky that there aren’t too many off-roaders in the areas we service.” So that Jeep in the picture may be a challenge.
Wype’s service area is still small, and the mobile web version will roll out in the next couple of weeks. (The iOS app is out there already; there is not an Android app.)
So to recap: Wype will clean your car. Wyper will help you shop for a car. The URLs for Wipe.com and Wiper.com, as far as I can tell, are up for grabs.

314,The trends driving electric vehicle development,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/01/rise-of-the-electric-vehicle/,2016/06/01,"




Ion Yadigaroglu

Ion Yadigaroglu is the managing principal of Capricorn Investment Group.


In case you weren’t paying attention, something amazing just happened to the automobile industry.
The recent unveiling of Tesla’s Model 3 resulted in the largest product pre-order in history. The fact that within days of launch about 400,000 people paid $1,000 each for a car they will receive in 2018 is simply astounding. In addition to the $400 million wired to Tesla, this represents an order book of more than $15 billion dollars.
There’s more. Three technology trends are converging in automobile transportation — and not a minute too soon, given the giant emissions and human carnage wrought by conventional vehicles:

In my view, Tesla has demonstrated that electric vehicles can result in a superior automotive product in terms of driving performance, safety, comfort and even convenience.
On-demand and ridesharing services shifted billions of car miles (including more than 1.5 billion miles on Uber alone) to their offering and made the case that ownership is an unnecessary and perhaps even negative part of the car experience.
Finally, autonomous driving is captivating everyone’s imagination in how it can both address safety in a more fundamental way and offer the next level of convenience (in addition to life-changing benefits to groups such as the blind and disabled).


These three big technological themes have accelerated over the past decade, and they are now showing multiplier effects on each other. This convergence is leading to dozens of new startups.  The traditional automakers are deploying large resources in this space, and now Tesla, Uber, Apple and Google — some of the most dynamic and successful technology companies in the world — are showing up in the driver’s seat of a new frontier.
Battery technology is at the core of what is needed to further drive electric vehicle adoption. The issue is mainly lowering the cost of batteries, with performance already adequate for most applications. The cost of a kilowatt of lithium-ion storage has dropped from about $1,000 in 2008 to something like $200 today. There are numerous advanced technologies that promise costs of $100 and less in the years ahead. The scale-up of global battery capacity will require very large investments, in the tens of billions of dollars, which are only just beginning. The race for those future plants remains open, and we see it as a highly dynamic and exciting area of investment.
On the ridesharing front, dozens of business models are addressing the absurd inefficiency of the current ownership model — where cars are left unused, on average, 23 hours of every day. By significantly increasing the utilization rate of vehicles, companies like Uber, Lyft, Kuaidi Dache, Ola and others are reducing the number of cars on the road. This has a direct positive environmental impact, by reducing congestion-related pollution and the need for additional road infrastructure, which will be multiplied with the roll-out of zero-emission electric vehicles. 
Automation is perhaps the most captivating and science-fiction-like development. Self-driving cars are already a reality. The challenge is how to manage the roll-out in terms of regulation and infrastructure. The inevitable coexistence, at least initially, of self-driving vehicles with their human-operated counterparts will certainly pose quandaries.
Significantly less prone to accidents than human operators, self-driving vehicles allow us to imagine transportation without the associated carnage on the world’s roads. More than 1 million people were killed globally in vehicle crashes last year. An incredible boost to economic productivity and leisure can also be foreseen with millions of hours of commuting time becoming available for whatever we choose to do with them.

Finally, the positive environmental impact is potentially the biggest win of these technological shifts. Sustainable transportation, enabled and supported by the deployment of renewable electricity infrastructure, will make a significant dent in global carbon emissions.
Roughly three hundred billion dollars were invested in wind and solar power plants last year, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. That makes renewable infrastructure one of the largest capital expenditures globally. I think a similar big bang will soon occur in transportation with the race for better batteries. 
Many companies are already embracing the inherent opportunities of large-scale change. Others that don’t fully embrace the powerful forces at play will likely be challenged the way coal firms and cheating car companies are stumbling today.

315,"The sweep of the Internet of Things, garbage cans and all",https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/27/the-sweep-of-the-internet-of-things-garbage-cans-and-all/,2016/05/27,"




Jake Rozmaryn
Contributor



Jake Rozmaryn is the CEO of Eco Branding and Conference Director for the Midwest Solar Expo and Energy Storage Symposium.


Who could imagine being wowed by a garbage can? In our age of technological whiz-bang, not much floors us anymore. But I confess, I couldn’t stop thinking about the lowly garbage can.
Embedded with smart sensors, it alerts city workers when it’s ready to be emptied, which slashes fuel costs and avoids unnecessary garbage pickups. That may not sound so impressive — at least compared to driverless cars or sending regular folk into space — but when the dumbest of items gains intelligence, we need to pay attention.
We are entering a phase in the cleantech revolution where we are reaping efficiency value from even the most mundane items.
“The garbage app reduces energy costs by 50% to 60%. That’s not pie-in-the-sky — those are real savings for real cities that can make them even more livable and enjoyable for residents,” says Tim Wolf, Global Director of Marketing for Smart Grid Solutions at Itron.
Call it Cleantech 3.0 or Energy Democracy, this new iteration takes us beyond solar energy and the early technologies that kicked off the clean energy revolution. Now bits and bytes are infiltrating everyday objects, allowing them to “talk” to each other and make smart energy decisions. Dorothy, we’re not in Kansas anymore — or at least its wind farms.
Enter the Internet of Things
Why is renewable energy now old school? Credit the Internet of Things, or IoT. Green is still good, but digitally connected green is even better.
IoT is a network of physical objects — devices, machinery, vehicles, buildings and other items — embedded with electronics, software and sensors that enable these objects to collect and exchange data.
Connecting our disparate “things” — and giving them intelligence — creates autonomous systems that are convenient and user-friendly in ways that can drastically improve home and work environments — as in the garbage can that can signal to city trash collectors.
In the energy arena, IoT brings together all kinds of things to create smart networks, such as hot water heaters, home thermostats, solar panels and microgrids. These networks can automate anything that generates, consumes, measures, switches or stores energy.
The power of controlling energy distribution no longer resides with just utilities.
IoT also helps consumers collect granular data so they can track their energy consumption in real time. What you can see, you can save. So now consumers are better able to lower their energy bills.
All of these changes upend the old way of doing business in the energy industry. The power of controlling energy distribution no longer resides with just utilities; it’s become decentralized. You and I gain more control over energy generation and usage.
Putting energy management into the hands of individual consumers and businesses is forcing utilities to rethink their business models. Rather than fighting decentralized energy, forward-thinking utilities are embracing it.
“As the grid moves toward a more distributed model, the command-and-control infrastructure is moving to a more distributed model as well,” Wolf says.
How IoT makes Cleantech 3.0 possible
IoT has made its way into the public consciousness through devices like the Nest thermostat, and it will soon be universal. Businesses of all sizes are starting to realize its power to transform how they handle their energy needs — to save money, improve resiliency and reduce carbon footprint.
According to Tom Willie, CEO of Blue Pillar, IoT is at the foundation of Cleantech 3.0. “Without IoT, you can’t effectively deploy onsite energy solutions,” Willie says. “People are realizing that if you’re going to build a behind-the-meter grid, you need on-site command-and-control.”
Green is still good, but digitally connected green is even better.
“The growth of on-site generation has started expanding exponentially in the past 10 years, but most on-site energy systems are still disconnected and working in silos,” he adds. “You need the ability to centrally connect, control and optimize everything from renewables and back-up generators to microgrids, energy storage and traditional building automation systems. That’s why the new energy IoT solutions are so critical — we need a ubiquitous, connected energy ecosystem.”
What’s truly amazing, Willie says, is that new energy IoT solutions will even allow connection and control of older equipment that was installed before the Internet was around, positively impacting energy usage and costs.
“It’s an exciting time to be at the intersection of IoT and energy management,” he says. “The future is limited only by our imaginations.”
What it means to you
Here’s what Cleantech 3.0 means for those it will affect most:


Utilities: Many utilities and energy service providers struggle to integrate renewable energy and energy efficiency into aging 20th century business models. Cleantech 3.0 will prepare them to compete in the 21st century by drastically improving their ability to manage and dispatch distributed energy. This will allow unregulated utilities to embrace behind-the-meter distributed generation to their advantage. For example, by treating their customers’ solar panels, microgrids and other distributed energy resources as an extension of the traditional electricity grid, they can increase resiliency and reduce the burden on the aging infrastructure. Better still, legacy utilities can leverage the IoT to create new services that they can then offer to end-customers, adding additional revenue for shareholders and keeping businesses relevant.

Industry: Improving connectivity, access to data and control of energy devices will help industries improve energy efficiency, resiliency and self-sufficiency. In practical terms, IoT can help reduce energy waste, improve operational efficiency and hedge against power outages and rising energy costs. As individual industries realize the benefits of controlling their own energy, this nascent trend will expand to everyone — from healthcare and big-box retailers to data centers and beyond.

Consumers: Cleantech 3.0 will help consumers by putting the cost of energy in their hands. Not only does it allow them to choose how to spend their energy dollars, it gives consumers control of every electrical device in the home through smart phones, and increases comfort as these devices “learn” their patterns. It is going to revolutionize how consumers handle their energy needs — and thereby revolutionize energy distribution.

“Cleantech 3.0 will democratize the way people consume energy, and that’s a good thing,” says Robert Cooper, CEO of Embue. “The awareness of what your energy costs are and how you consume it will empower people to use energy more efficiently and cost-effectively. The revolution is coming, and those who are on the cutting edge will be the biggest winners.”
A reshuffling of responsibility
Cleantech 3.0 is causing a reshuffling of responsibility across the energy landscape — and has the potential to affect entire city infrastructures, leading to the development of so-called “smart cities” that rely on IoT.

“The killer IoT apps that will revolutionize cities will be for smart energy and water systems,” Itron’s Wolf says. “Right now, we lose 25% of water we pump through the streets — unacceptable in a world that will soon run short on water resources. And you can reduce street light energy costs by up to 80% if you combine LED replacement bulbs with network-controlled monitoring applications.”
The roles and relationships between energy production, distribution and consumption are changing, and the end-user will ultimately win. How quickly this shakes out will depend on the speed with which utilities and their customers embrace the transition.
Meanwhile, keep an eye on your household devices — even boring ones like garbage cans — they soon may surprise you.

316,Tesla’s patent strategy opens the road to sustainability for transport and for itself,https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/26/teslas-patent-strategy-opens-the-road-to-sustainability-for-transport-and-for-itself/,2016/05/26,"

Craig Buschmann is an intellectual property attorney at Brinks Gilson & Lione.


What makes Tesla unique? How about everything. Mention patents to most people and their eyes glaze over. Worse, they think of patent “trolls” that some say are harming American businesses. But everyone appreciates one fundamental fact: Patents, and intellectual property generally, mean value.
Tesla began accepting orders on March 31 for its Model 3 electric vehicle at around $35,000. But unlike companies that jealousy guard their patents and intellectual property, Tesla’s  giving away its patents for free.
Why? It has a lot to do with how the company imagines its future markets — and how it manages its world-famous brand.
Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk famously announced not two years ago, “All Our Patent Are Belong To You.” (The sentence is an inside joke for coders and video game mavens: Musk’s seemingly unusual grammar refers to a well-known Internet meme, “All Your Base Are Belong to Us,” a mistranslation of a Japanese phrase in the early 1990s video game Zero Wing.)
Musk said Tesla would “not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use our technology.” In doing so, Tesla created a limited, open-source patent pool for the technologies used to build its electric vehicles (EVs) — including for vehicle components, battery charging, energy storage and power optimization.
Why give its patents away? To build the size of the market, and its own share of it. Tesla’s vision is an electric-powered future for automobiles and sophisticated energy storage systems, so the company must change a culture accustomed to internal combustion engines, and it must revolutionize the nation’s fuel delivery infrastructure.
As more people buy EVs, demand for a charging infrastructure increases. As the number of charging stations increases, it’s easier for potential buyers to rationalize a purchase. Not to mention that each charging location becomes another powerful advertisement of the Tesla brand, and a showroom for its vehicles.
The cultural and network effects reinforce each other in a positive feedback loop. And that moves Tesla toward its goal: selling all-electric vehicles to an increasingly larger group of buyers — buyers confident they’ll have access to power wherever they need it.
As the pie grows, everyone gets a larger slice.
Tesla’s not even the first automotive manufacturer to build and sell an EV. But that brings it back to brand.
Consider: What name leaps to mind when thinking about an electric car? How many people think Tesla first, and any one of the Nissan Leaf, BMW i3 or Chevy Bolt second?
Tesla’s Model 3 is an EV priced to put all-electric transportation within reach of middle-class buyers, with the cachet of a market-leading brand renowned for innovation. A lower-cost entry point — like Apple’s recently announced price cut for the Apple Watch, and its new, smaller iPhone — can increase market share by driving wider adoption.
By making its patents available for free, Tesla empowers others to build electric vehicles. More cars come along and the grid gets bigger. As the pie grows, everyone gets a larger slice.
Why don’t other automakers do the same thing? Simple: Established auto manufacturers have focused only intermittently on the EV market. More recently, Toyota, Ford and GM have focused on alternative fuel technologies like hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) or other partially electrified vehicles.
Established automakers can afford to adapt to new market opportunities over time. Tesla, as many investors know already, is burning cash and has yet to turn a profit. Its very survival is at stake.
Truth be told, Toyota and Ford do license their alternative fuel technology patents: Toyota for its hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs) and Ford for its HEVs. But they have different approaches to doing so.
Toyota is offering its powertrain technology patents royalty-free through 2020; royalty-free access to its hydrogen production and supply patents as yet never expires. The company is less reliant on other market players to assist in setting a standard for FCVs, so it needn’t rely on others to help establish a market for them. But like Tesla, Toyota will benefit from a larger fueling network, so it’s reducing the cost to others who are interested in adding to the number of hydrogen fueling stations.

The future of the car is not about propulsion

Ford’s approach to licensing is more traditional. Some of its patents for HEV technology are available for a fee. But Ford doesn’t need a tool to help create the conditions necessary for the relatively more mature technology, which has been mass-marketed for nearly 20 years, to succeed. It can afford to view its patent pool as a potential new source of revenue.
Tesla wins by using its patent pool to establish industry standards for EVs. Unique in the marketplace, Tesla wins for the brand by doing what Elon Musk famously does all the time: going against the grain. Building markets, bolstering the public’s view of the brand, staying famous, all the time, for everything it does.
Technology innovators have much to learn from Tesla’s example. And whose eyes would glaze over when the topic of patents has to do with revolutionizing how the entire world travels?

317,"Meet the latest cohort of Acceleprise startups, and the apps they built to make work easier",https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/25/meet-the-latest-cohort-of-acceleprise-startups-and-the-apps-they-built-to-make-work-easier/,2016/05/25,"
Acceleprise, a San Francisco-based accelerator for enterprise tech and software-as-a-service startups, held a Demo Day for its third cohort of companies today.
The accelerator invests $50,000 into each startup admitted to its program via convertible note financing, taking approximately a 5 percent stake under a $1 million cap.
It admits 8-12 companies per cohort, and invests out of a $3.5 million pre-seed fund anchored by Employ Insight CEO Sean Glass.
During its program, Acceleprise helps startups hone their apps and business models, strike relationships with early pilot or paying customers and officially launch a product.
After they leave the nest, partners at Acceleprise work in an advisory capacity with startups in their portfolio to help them become seed- or even Series A-ready.
Acceleprise Managing Director Michael Cardamone said that the fundraising environment has become more challenging for SaaS businesses of late.
Venture investors with institutional firms that do early-stage deals now want to see software-as-a-service startups making $1.5 million in annual recurring revenue with significant traction in their respective markets before they will sign a term sheet, Cardamone said.
That’s a higher bar than business-to-business software startups faced just three years ago.
Cardamone said selling into enterprises has become more competitive, as well.
“The people who set tech policies and make purchasing decisions within large or fast-growing companies, and that’s usually a Chief Information Officer, are using tens of different apps, and many I’ve met will be using over 100 different apps to keep their businesses running,” Cardamone said.
That means SaaS companies can’t offer something that’s only a slightly better tool than what’s out there and expect to win customers over, even for a limited trial run.
Back in the day when juggernauts of enterprise tech were ramping up, like Salesforce or Amazon Web Services, the market wasn’t nearly as cluttered.
Companies in Acceleprise’s latest batch were equally split between those focused on a particular industry, from agriculture (Skycision) to mobile telecoms (MobilePhire), and those offering “horizontal” solutions that could help businesses in any industry manage travel and expenses (TripCloud) or deliver customer service via popular messaging platforms from SMS to Facebook Messenger or Slack (Lifecycle.io).
A new trend among applicants, Cardamone noticed, was the implementation of advanced machine learning, analytics and chat bots to solve the needs of workers or their employers.
A full list of the 8 companies in the most recent cohort at Acceleprise follows below, with links and descriptions supplied by the accelerator. 

Baloonr: Anonymously surface and prioritize information for any group.
CareerLark: Next generation performance management and employee feedback platform.
ContextSmith: Turns distributed emails with customers into actionable data.
Glowfish.io: Industrial IoT enhanced asset monitoring and early warning as a service.
Lifecycle.io: The simplest way for businesses to create intelligent conversations over mobile messaging channels.
MobilePhire: Analytics and control for corporate mobile data usage.
Skycision: Image-based crop management software for the global agriculture industry.
TripCloud: Free travel management solution for small- to medium-sized businesses.

The Bay Area fosters a culture of forward thinkers and new ways to solve problems in our world, including in our food system. Ripple Foods is one such startup in Silicon Valley hoping to disrupt the dairy industry with pea protein.
The company joins a growing list of game-changing food startups that have launched out of the lab and into the consumer market in just the last few years. Memphis Meats uses animal cells to make lab-grown beef, Impossible Foods makes a plant-based burger and Clara Foods uses yeast to produce egg whites without the chicken.
We’re told milk does a body good, but the dairy industry can be a dirty business, polluting our environment and pumping large amounts of methane into the air — the biggest contributor to global warming. And Ripple founders wanted to do something about it, so they turned to the humble pea.
Ripple’s first dairy-free milk products made from pea protein.
Sure, there are already alternatives to dairy milk, but many of them are problematic — soy is mostly from GMO crops and full of pesticides, almond milk takes up a lot of precious water resources and coconut milk is hard on those suffering from irritable bowel syndrome.
But peas are plentiful, full of vitamins (an extremely good source of vitamin K, manganese, dietary fiber, vitamin B1, copper, vitamin C, phosphorus and folate, among a long list of other nutrients) and GMO-free.
And Ripple believes it has created the superior non-dairy option and perfected that same milky “mouth feel” you get from dairy using the plant’s protein, sans that pea soup taste.
Ripple also claims to be vegan-friendly, lactose, nut, and gluten-free, doesn’t use GMO products and uses 96 percent less water than dairy, nut and soy milk.
The startup has raised $13.6 million from investors and started selling its first four non-dairy milk flavors — original, original unsweetened, vanilla and chocolate — in Whole Foods nationwide in April.

319,Nanomaterials could double efficiency of solar cells by converting waste heat into usable energy,https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/24/nanomaterials-could-double-efficiency-of-solar-cells-by-converting-waste-heat-into-usable-energy/,2016/05/24,"
An experimental solar cell created by MIT researchers could massively increase the amount of power generated by a given area of panels, while simultaneously reducing the amount of waste heat. Even better, it sounds super cool when scientists talk about it: “with our own unoptimized geometry, we in fact could break the Shockley-Queisser limit.”
The Shockley-Queisser limit, which is definitely not made up, is the theoretical maximum efficiency of a solar cell, and it’s somewhere around 32 percent for the most common silicon-based ones.

You can get around this by various tricks like stacking cells, but the better option, according to David Bierman, a doctoral student on the team (and who is quoted above), will be thermophotovoltaics — whereby sunlight is turned into heat and then re-emitted as light better suited for the cell to absorb.
Sound weird? Here’s the thing. Solar cells work best with a certain wavelength of light — perhaps ultraviolet is too short, while infrared is too long, but let’s say 600nm (orange visible light) is perfect. Only some of the broad-spectrum radiation emitted by the sun is at or around 600nm, which limits the amount of energy the cell can pull out of that radiation — that’s one of the components of the Shockley-Queisser limit.
What Bierman and the others on his team did was to add a step between the sun and the cell: a carefully engineered structure of carbon nanotubes. “The carbon nanotubes are virtually a perfect absorber over the entire color spectrum,” said Bierman in the MIT news release. “All of the energy of the photons gets converted to heat.”
The team’s thermophotovoltaic cell in action.
Normally heat is undesirable in a solar cell, as it’s just waste energy that can interfere with normal operation. But in this case, the heat is not allowed to dissipate; instead, the carbon nanostructure converts the heat back into light — at the exact optimum wavelength of the photovoltaic cell.
The result is a huge increase in efficiency, and that’s not the only benefit. Heat, unlike light, is easy to store and move. If the day’s sunlight were entirely converted to heat and stored away, it could be converted to light on demand — like, say, at night. In other words, this technique essentially allows sunlight to be saved for later.
Experimental results bore out the theory, and a prototype TPV cell performed as expected. But the tech still needs to make it out of the lab, and manufacturing the complex carbon nanomaterials in bulk is no simple task. So you won’t be using thermophotovoltaics next year or the year after — but the technique is a tremendously promising one and unlikely to be left on the shelf.
The team’s research was published in the journal Nature Energy.

Chilling news regarding climate change continues to arrive on a regular basis, even as Antarctica warms dangerously and further troubling global symptoms emerge. It’s a grand shame that global governments seem unable to mobilize to the degree necessary to keep Antarctica safely frigid and other climate-change-related catastrophes at bay.
It’s also a shame that those same governments don’t seem to realize quite how many potent, easily accessed and — interestingly enough — business-friendly weapons in the climate change battle they already possess, all too quietly, within their borders.
From Tel Aviv to Palo Alto, New York to London, entrepreneurs have created in the last handfuls of years an eclectic arsenal of innovations that are already beginning to show their mettle in the battle against climate change, as well as their potential to help the bottom lines of a wide swath of businesses. Many of these innovations currently fly inches, or miles, below the radar of public and governmental awareness. Yet the climate change needle could well be nudged if such disparate technologies were properly shared, engaged, supported and leveraged on a global scale.
Three years ago I was assigned to cover EcoScraps, an intriguing Utah-based company that fights climate change and benefits businesses organically, in multiple senses of the word. EcoScraps works by collecting food waste from grocery stores and wholesale produce suppliers, processing it and cycling it back to market as fertilizer.
In our interview, co-founder and CEO Daniel Blake commented that methane emissions — a prime concern addressed by President Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau in their recent climate change announcement — come heavily from rotting organic matter in landfills, which in turn can count for up to 8 percent of the greenhouse emissions that humans generate.
Forty percent of all food grown in the United States gets thrown away, Blake said, so the potential to reduce that waste, and the greenhouse emissions that result, is tremendous. Plus, Blake pointed out, grocery stores save money on their waste costs, “so everybody wins.”
Technologies that can benefit both businesses and the climate change battle are here now, working and waiting.
In light of recent predictions, his words take on new meaning. When creative, business-friendly solutions to climate change are successfully activated, every one of us indeed wins, even if the triumph is a small or incremental one.
EcoScraps was far from the only such solution I discovered, hiding in plain sight, while on assignment. Another is PK Clean, a pioneering Utah-based company that alchemizes plastic waste back into low-sulfur fuel.
PK Clean’s operations produce no toxic emissions and function as a continuous process — the reactor needed to transmute the plastic refuse is fed by the plastic itself, eliminating the need to wastefully heat and cool the system with every batch — so energy and money are saved. The innovation reduces not only the petroleum-based content of landfills and oceans, but the costs and emissions associated with transporting and storing large amounts of such plastic waste. Businesses and the atmosphere benefit alike from the transaction.
The exploding world of data-based innovation holds similar potential to benefit businesses and the climate change battle; my recent work within the world of Industrial IoT technologies, and the startup ecosystem as a whole, has allowed me to see this first-hand. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported that, in 2010, 21 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions were created by industry, 14 percent by transportation, 6 percent by buildings and 25 percent by electricity and heat production. Data-driven technologies exist that can immediately help each of these segments become more efficient, profitable and clean, on a global scale.

Innovations like these are really the tip of the proverbial (melting) iceberg. Whether high-tech or organic, digital or dirt-based, diverse and effective ways to battle climate change while increasing business profits are already here, already working. They just need to be amplified, furiously.
Global leaders in tech, government, business and beyond can help. Seeking, promoting, supporting and engaging existing innovations, on a large scale, is the sort of aggressive action that our time and planet require.
If a subset of political decision-makers must spend their time arguing and denying, blaming and stonewalling while Antarctica sweats, so be it. But in the meantime, technologies that can benefit both businesses and the climate change battle are here now, working and waiting. For the sake of the rest of us, they must be activated, globally and with great force.

321,ChargePoint raises $50 million to charge more cars,https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/24/chargepoint-raises-50-million-to-charge-more-cars/,2016/05/24,"
ChargePoint announced this month that it had raised $50 million in its latest round of funding, thanks in large part to Linse Capital. That makes a total of $164 million raised from investors like BMW iVentures and Siemens, among others. ChargePoint already has the largest EV charging network in North America, with 28,000 stations installed since 2007.
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, global sales of plug-in vehicles rose by about 80 percent in 2015, led by a surge in sales in China. (In the United States, EV sales actually dropped by about 3 percent.) In 2011, about 50,000 EVs were sold worldwide; in 2015, the number topped 565,000. Tenfold in four years isn’t too bad.
Linse Capital noted in the announcement that the additional funds will allow ChargePoint to expand its network outside North America. “This funding will accelerate ChargePoint’s ability to capitalize on that position in the North American market and replicate it in other markets around the world,” said Michael Linse, managing director of Linse Capital.
It’s worth noting, too, that the best-selling electric vehicle in the United States (and the world) for 2015 was the Tesla Model S, which has a range of at least 240 miles as rated by the EPA. Number two was the Nissan Leaf, which has an EPA-rated 107-mile range. It’s also half the price of a Tesla Model S. It’ll be close to the price of a Tesla Model 3, if you can wait a couple of years for that car’s expected 215-mile range.
Many of the electric cars available now, from the Chevy Spark to the Fiat 500e, have EPA ranges in the Leaf’s neighborhood. ChargePoint’s mission is to ease the range anxiety these owners may feel, even though the average American drives 29.2 miles per day, according to a AAA study. Its 28,000 charging points (thus the name) are installed in business parking lots, apartment garages and in homes with Level 2 charging; 310 of the stations have Level 3 Express DC fast charging.
In the chicken-and-egg game of electric vehicle adoptions, ChargePoint is supplying many of the chargers that will make EVs more practical for more people in the future.

322,The Europas — It’s time for a different kind of tech conference,https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/20/the-europas-its-time-for-different-type-of-tech-conference/,2016/05/20,"
Let’s face it. Some tech conferences have lost their way. While TechCrunch Disrupt remains a firmly curated, media-driven, event, with hundreds of journalists attending, a couple of other conferences have really gone for scale. A minimum of 15,000 people, thousands of companies, echoing halls — and a lot of investors (and journalists) turning their badges around so they don’t get torn apart by hungry entrepreneurs. Don’t get me wrong — there’s nothing wrong with scale, and it can be very useful. But isn’t it time to bring things back to a more human level?
So, in partnership with TechCrunch, The Europas Conference & Awards, which I founded, has come up with a new model. Think of it as a relaxed, summer prelude to the heat of Disrupt. (Tickets available here).
It goes like this:
• Far fewer people (800-1,000), with many of those specially invited
• Key Founders and investors speaking; many more invited to simply hang out
• Robust, expert discussions and Q&A directly from the main stage
• Intimate “breakout” sessions with key players on vertical topics
• The opportunity to meet almost everyone in those small groups, super-charging your networking
• No VIP rooms, which means you get to interact with the Speakers
• No live stream — you’re either ‘mindfully’ there or you’re not
• Major journalists from major tech titles, newspapers and business broadcasters
• A parallel Founders-only track (PathFounders) geared towards fund-raising and hyper-networking
• A stunning awards dinner and party which honors both the hottest startups and the leading lights in the European startup scene
That’s what The Europas hopes to achieve. A great group of people in the heart of London, Europe’s biggest startup ecosystem, with key investors, Founders and ecosystem-players. Far less pitching, but a lot more humane conversations in an environment where people can get to know each other in a non-transactional way.

And what better way to do that in the summer sun, by the River Thames, with a drink in your hand, the prospect of some great conversations, and a fantastic party and celebration of the European startup scene in the evening.
So who’s coming so far? Here’s a run-round of some of the key speakers, amongst many others. More will be announced soon.

Many new Founders quickly realize that company culture is at least as key to success as their product. To that end, Julia Hartz, co-founder of Eventbrite, will be speaking about how you build a robust team and culture.
Startups often talk about exits, often far too early. Greg Marsh, founder for onefinestay, will be coming along to give a full and frank account of his exit this year to AccorHotels for $170 million, after several years of building his company. How did he move towards the end game? We’ll find out.
Michael Schneider, who built and exited Mobile Roadie, will give us the scoop on how he’s building Service, his new startup, out of LA, and what the future of customer service actually looks like.

Bethany Koby, cofounder of Technology Will Save Us, will talk about the trials and tribulations of building a hardware startup out of Europe.
We’ll have John Henderson of White Star Capital discussing Artificial Intelligence with Azeem Azhar of The Exponential View and Anita Schjøll Brede of hot new AI startup out of Norway, Iris.ai. Founder-turned-VC Andy McLoughlin (Huddle) will be grilling startups in our Live Office Hours session with Local Global’s Saul Klein, Sonali de Rycker of Accel Partners, and Connect Ventures’ Sitar Teli and Nic Brisbourne of Forward Partners
We’ll be investigating and asking where the innovation is in Fintech with Passion Capital’s Eileen Burbidge, Mark Tluszcz of Mangrove Capital Partners, Taavet Hinrikus of Transferwise, and Tina Baker of Jag Shaw Baker.
Did someone says EUnicorn? What does the future hold for Europe’s Unicorns? We ask Qualcomm Ventures’ Jason Ball, and Balderton Capital’s Suranga Chandratillake will it all go Pete Tong for the European unicorn.
Other VCs and angels attending include Christian Hernandez (White Star Capital), Nenad Marovac (DN Capital), Irena Goldenberg (Highland Capital), Omri Benayoun (Partech), Tracy Doree (Spring Partners), and Harry Briggs (BGF Ventures).
You’ll hear about Cyber Security startups from Jonathan Luff (Cylon) and Ruth Anderson (Head of UK Cyber at KPMG). Growth Hacking will come courtesy of the founders of Secret Sauce. The Internet of Things will be debated by Thomas Nicholls (Sigfox) and Andy Hobsbawm (EVRYTHNG).

On Health startups we’ll have Ida Tin, Founder of Clue from Berlin. And on Internationalization Brynne Herbert from MoveGuides. More to come!
Confirmed Media so far include Liam Boogar (RudeBaguuette), Robin Wauters (Tech.EU), Madhumita Murgia (The Daily Telegraph) and James Cook (Business Insider).

We’ll also get a different flavor from world-renowned speaker Jonathan MacDonald, founder of the Thought Expansion Network, who will present the exclusive findings of his survey “What gives a company the most competitive advantage” which you can participate in here.
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1aYQwOK5NcG6pm7ercb6z_HQ-Nolu0fkeun_6p1UrxAE/viewform?usp=fb_send_twt

323,Edyn debuts smart water valve to put home gardens on autopilot,https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/19/edyn-debuts-smart-water-valve-to-put-home-gardens-on-autopilot/,2016/05/19," 



Oakland, Calif.-based Edyn started selling a new, smart gardening device this week: an Internet-connected water valve that lets users irrigate their gardens or lawns automatically.
The Edyn Water Valve uses data from the company’s Edyn Garden Sensor, a soil sensor, along with local weather systems, to adjust the moisture levels in the soil. If a user wants, they can adjust their irrigation systems via the Edyn smartphone app.
Sold for $69, the Edyn Water Valve weighs less than eight ounces, is solar-powered, Wi-Fi-enabled and fits a standard garden hose. The Edyn system was designed to be small enough for use with a hose that’s connected to a kitchen sink, and a window box garden if desired.

Recently, Edyn CEO and founder Jason Arumburu showed TechCrunch how the new water valve works at the STEM Kitchen & Garden, maintained by Farmscape urban agriculture, in San Francisco.
Edyn previously raised seed funding from Fenox Venture Capital, Idea Bulb Ventures, Morningside Group, Indicator ventures, Y Combinator, and was a Startup Battlefield finalist.
Other hardware makers, like Rachio Inc., Koubachi AG, iConservo Inc. and the drone-tech company Parrot, are offering competing products. But Edyn has gained traction in a crowded market for gardening tech.
Its products are sold at Home Depot stores, and the company will soon be adding new brick-and-mortar retailers, Arumburu said.

324,Boosted’s v2 electric skateboards go 12 miles with swappable batteries,https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/19/boosteds-v2-electric-skateboards-go-12-miles-with-swappable-batteries/,2016/05/19,"
The Boosted Board is the best electric skateboard on the market, but its biggest flaw is a troublingly low range of 6 miles per charge. Today, Boosted opened pre-orders of its Gen 2 boards for $999 to $1599, solving the problem with extended and swappable battery options that let them go almost twice as far.
For $99 extra you can upgrade from a 7-mile to a 12-mile battery, or you can buy an extra standard battery for $299 or extended for $399. By Boosting the range, the startup’s skateboards can evolve from last-mile commuting tools to better replacements for a bike or car.

Launched out of Y Combinator and Kickstarter in 2012, Boosted Boards makes electric longboards controlled with a handheld wireless remote. Depending on the model, they can go up to 22 mph. The belt-driven motor can power you up even steep hills. And the regenerative brakes let you slow down quickly or coast down steep hills at a comfortable speed. There’s even an app for tracking your mileage or syncing firmware updates.

Boosted Boards has raised two seed rounds from SV Angel, Rothenberg Ventures, and others, plus a Series A. It’s currently working on another type of electric vehicle, possibly a bicycle, but the company is staying mum.
It released an upgraded Dual+ board in 2014, but this is its big second product push. The Gen 2 boards also include some other cool new features:


Accessory Port – so you can plug in onboard headlights and tail lights that Boosted plans to sell or from third-parties, or charge your phone

Improved Water Resistance – so you can handle hitting the odd puddle or damp street, though you still shouldn’t ride in the rain or through significant standing water

Stronger, More Secure Connectivity – to prevent your handheld remote from disconnecting from the board if you hit a Bluetooth interference, and protect you from hackers

Better Deck, Wheels, And Drivetrain – for a smoother ride on a lighter board, plus better carving, torque, braking, acceleration, and hill climbing

Modular, User-Swappable Components – so you can customize, upgrade, and repair your board

International Sales Approval – so you can finally buy one no matter where you live

The improved security is especially important after Wired reported last year that researchers discovered they could hack the Boosted Board over Bluetooth and take control of it. That could let someone slam on the brakes while you’re riding.

Here’s the updated line of boards, which you can reserve with an $100 down payment:


Boosted Board Single – Top Speed: 18 mph – Standard Range: 8 miles for $999, Extended Range: 14 miles for $1099

Boosted Board Dual – Top Speed: 20 mph – Standard Range: 7 miles for $1299, Extended Range: 12 miles for $1399

Boosted Board Dual+ – Top Speed: 22 mph – Standard Range: 7 miles for $1499, Extended Range: 12 miles for $1599

We recommend the Dual or Dual+. The extra power is necessary for getting up steep hills. And since the Single only has a motor on one wheel instead of two, your acceleration or brakes can falter if you turn too hard and that wheel lifts off the ground. You can check out our glowing review of the old Dual+ here:



With battery life improved, the biggest problem with owning a Boosted Board is the risk of hurting yourself. The extra speed electric skateboards provide mean that if you get in an accident, you’re going down fast.
Me, riding a Boosted before my accident
I learned the hard way.
After 13 years of longboarding and 2.5 on my Boosted without injury, a giant pothole swallowed me up. I seriously broke my ankle. I know plenty of other people who’ve hurt themselves too. In almost all cases, the problem was either an inexperienced rider, a swerving car, or an unexpected road obstacle — not the board acting up. But going 20 mph instead of around 12 on an unpowered board meant those crashes caused broken arms, collar bones, and more.
I’ve tried several other electric skateboards like ZBoards and Evolve skateboards. Boosteds are the best not just because of the specs, but because of the more subtle mapping of the controller to the board. Boosteds accelerate and brake more smoothly, and are more responsive than any of the other boards. If you’re trusting your life to a piece of tech, it has to perform as expected every time, and the Boosted does.
If you want an electric skateboard, the Boosted Dual or Dual+ is the way to go. But just because you have the power to go faster, doesn’t mean you always should. Lean on the Boosted for getting up hills or going down them safely, or to avoid foot-pedaling on long straight-aways. Flooring it every chance you get might feel fun and look cool, but your body could pay the price.
Boosted CEO Sanjay Dastoor admits “It does require skill to use, just like a bike or car, and it’s not for everyone.” But he says he hadn’t skateboarded before Boosted and now rides almost every day.
Sick of walking from the train to the office? Getting bikes stolen because you have to lock them up outside? Struggling to find parking? Or paying for short Uber rides? If you know how to longboard or are willing to take the time to learn somewhere safe away from traffic, an electric skateboard could add spice and convenience to your life. There’s nothing like carving big, soft arcs down the pavement…uphill.

People love their smartphones but hate poor battery life. We love having access to the world’s information at our fingertips but tire of the need to constantly plug in to the world’s electricity grid. The recharging model of batteries fails us — the marketplace is ready for a new approach to portable power.
We may be entering the early days of refueling products to gain longer performance and freedom from cords and electric sockets. Beyond powering our devices 10 times longer than batteries, this refueling model of personal power systems might also set the stage for a “leapfrog” energy scenario that brings billions of people into the age of electricity by delivering clean fuels to retail shelves.
Refueling versus recharging
In January of this year, social media spread viral stories about a CES demonstration of an iPhone that could hold its power for a week, and shared images of a hydrogen-fueled drone that could fly six times longer than a battery-operated version. Both stories hinted that there might be a fuel-based revolution ahead in portable energy for our smartphones and laptops.
At the center of the excitement is a magical energy technology: the micro fuel cell. In basic terms, a fuel cell converts chemical energy into electricity. When devices need more power, we simply add more fuel. No wait time for recharging. No cords. Just add clean fuel that you can find on any retail shelf across the world.
The company behind both breakthrough stories is U.K.-based Intelligent Energy. While the British company is far from a household name, industry insiders recognize that Intelligent Energy is within striking distance of a potential game-changer for how we power our portable devices. Carry their vision out far enough and micro fuel cells might also transform how we solve issues of global-energy access to clean fuels and electricity.
While the CES iPhone and drone stories made headlines, an earlier (and more important) announcement was widely ignored. In late 2015, Intelligent Energy entered OEM agreement to develop embedded fuel cells for an emerging smartphone developer. What does this signal mean? Cutting the cord to electrical outlets or charging pads is actually possible with current technology.
As fuel-cell technology matures in the years ahead, we can imagine refueling our phones once or twice a month.
Intelligent Energy isn’t alone in its quest to bring micro fuel cells to the world. First-generation micro fuel cell products — sold as battery rechargers to campers, business travelers and the military — are coming to market from Brunton, MyFC JAQ, Kraftwerk and Ardica. The challenge for these companies is to avoid being branded as a “battery recharging system,” and presenting the technology as a new way of thinking about portable personal power and the role of clean hydrogen-rich fuels.
To jumpstart the transition, all eyes will be on decisions made by manufacturers like Foxconn, Apple, Samsung and Sony, which will deliver the fuel-cell proposition to consumers. These manufacturers want to deliver consumer products that have unprecedented power, performance and convenience. Embedding power plants inside devices would be a small leap for manufacturers, and a potentially giant leap for consumers seeking to escape the cycle of daily recharging.
The future of refueling portable devices is an ideal business model: more convenient for consumers and also more expensive. Skeptics may question consumer willingness to shift from very cheap electricity (annual recharging costs under $10) to buying premium fuels (likely $30-100/year). Opportunists will point to bottled water as an example of where a portable, premium version of a cheaper product has succeeded.
Premium cartridges of hydrogen-rich fuels would be available on retail shelves and everywhere across the public landscape (think malls and airports that currently offer charging stations). Because fuel devices run 6-10 times longer than batteries, the need to refuel will be infrequent. As fuel-cell technology matures in the years ahead, we can imagine refueling our phones once or twice a month. The tremendous benefit lies in the constant uptime and, by extension, a lack of stress that our batteries will die while we’re on the go.
Challenges and opportunities
Will our default fuel be hydrogen or a liquid fuel like butane currently used for lighters? The standards for refueling micro fuel cells remain unresolved. The sector is ripe for a battle of Beta versus VHS (or, more recently, Apple charger plug versus newer Apple charger plug). The most likely candidates are portable fueling packets of hydrogen-rich gas, liquid fuels or solid-state hydrogen.
Portable fuels and micro fuel cells offer something the cleantech world has yet to see: incentive-free, market-driven growth. While solar, wind and behind-the-meter battery storage have relied heavily on government incentives to jumpstart and sustain growth, micro fuel cells don’t require a government subsidy for growth. Selling fuels on retail shelves opens a pathway that is entirely driven by consumer demand as people will pay more for hydrogen-rich fuel because it powers their devices for significantly longer than electricity-dependent batteries.
We might expect first-generation fuel cells embedded in smartphones and laptops within the next five years.
Hydrogen’s role as a universal energy carrier is an upside for this scenario of portable personal power. Suppliers of hydrogen-rich fuels can emerge in any region around the world using feedstocks from traditional natural gas or from new cleantech brands that sell solar-hydrogen or bio-derived hydrogen at a premium. Concerns over energy losses from producing and storing hydrogen are muted these days as researchers improve nano-materials that drive chemical reactions.
Incremental revolution of refueling versus recharging
The next decade will be critical for micro fuel-cell innovations. Think of the technology as somewhere between a late 1980s Motorola carry-pack cellular phone and the late 1990s flip phone. The vision of fuel-based power systems is compelling, and the technology’s maturity hints at an S-curve tipping point ahead. Yet this energy platform will still need old-fashioned time and experience.
Believing in this scenario rests on two assumptions that must remain true. The first is that refueling beats recharging. The electrochemical conversion of fuels into electricity will always outperform the storage approach of batteries. Second, the profits of selling fuels will sustain this higher-cost path of embedded fuel cells while dropping costs for global scaling.
Slow pace of fast change
No roadmap for rethinking portable energy has been made public yet, but by taking a deep look at positioning by industry players and consumer frustration with batteries, we might expect first-generation fuel cells embedded in smartphones and laptops within the next five years. From there, the cost curve matures and the scaling phase begins. Headlines from the not-too-distant future might resemble the following timeline:
August 2018: The energy revolution at… Burning Man. News stories emerge from Burning Man communities embracing small stationary and micro fuel cells to power camps and art pieces. Many in the community applaud the small footprint and efficiency of these solid-state devices and claim that the hydrogen fuel is produced from green sources. Skeptical Burners complain that empty hydrogen fuel packets litter the Playa and express concerns of waste byproducts.
September 2020: Apple CEO Ashton Kutcher announces embedded fuel cell for iPhone 10. The audience commends the elegant design of Apple iFuel dispensers and H2 cartridges — ignoring the fact that Apple will now make an estimated $85 a year per consumer to refuel their devices.  Apple fans rejoice and say the premium is worth the convenience to only refuel devices twice a month.
December 2022: China’s five-year fuel-cell plan. The Communist Party announces revision to its latest Five-Year Plan and will focus on higher-value product integration and scaling challenges of embedded fuel cells inside consumer devices and industrial equipment.
April 2024: Intel acquires Intelligent Energy. In its push for embedded energy systems, Intel acquires the talent and assets of U.K.’s fast-growing fuel-cell designer. The US$6 billion acquisition represents a new direction for Intel into clean energy space.
November 2028: The cordless Christmas. If we thought unplugging from the landline phone was big, retailers are now touting cordless fuel-cell-based products. IKEA has announced plans to eliminate cords by 2035. GE sells an LED lightbulb with all the fuel it will ever need for its lifetime.
May 2029: Texas copper-free construction permits. Texas has become first state to grant permits for residential and commercial housing to be built without internal electrical wires and wall sockets. Micro and stationary fuel cells are expected to eliminate the high costs of wiring buildings, possibly rendering electricians the buggy-whip makers of our era.
October 2030: Amazon + Walmart compete to become the No. 1 fuel distributor. Large retailers see opportunities in delivering a range of fueling solutions, from liquid hydrogen-rich fuels to solid-state hydrogen packets. CEOs from Amazon and Walmart have announced their vision to become the world’s largest fuel distributors. Utility stocks continue to decline.
Illuminating the road ahead
Looking beyond 2030, it’s possible to imagine manufacturers integrating fuel cells inside our coffee makers, lamps, irons, vacuum cleaners, washer-dryers or any other object that benefits from long energy life and cordless convenience. Product designers will be thrilled to say goodbye to cords and dependency on electrical outlets. Simply add a cartridge of new fuel or refuel via a dispenser and you’re up and running.
Beyond predictions of early adopters paying a premium for device fuels is a much more impactful goal: a distribution model for radically expanding global access to electricity. Clean fuels could be brought to market anywhere in the world at a variety of price points. Local markets could generate their own hydrogen-rich fuels from regionally available resources. It’s also not difficult to imagine a low-cost supply chain that enables the manufacturing of solid-state fuel cells in regions across the world.
The expanse is wide between embedding fuel cells in a smartphone and a scalable retail-based global energy marketplace. To fill in the gaps, companies like Intelligent Energy will need to solve deep technical challenges and follow sustainable business models that focus on early-adopter markets. For now, micro fuel cells give us a compelling vision for moving beyond batteries and possibly transforming how billions of people might leapfrog into the age of electricity.

Safaricom launches innovation center to move beyond M-Pesa
Africa Roundup: MEST, Airbus and Microsoft expand in Africa, while Afrostream shutters




Across East Africa more than 300,000 households previously without electricity are powering homes and devices with solar panels and using mobile money to pay for it.
Their power provider is M-KOPA, an energy startup with IPO ambitions already backed by $52 million in VC.
Co-founded by Canadian Jesse Moore, the company offers solar-power home systems targeted at lower-income and rural customers without electricity. M-KOPA’s baseline box-kit comes stocked with a solar panel, multi-device charger, lights, radio and a pay-as-you-go SIM card.

After a $35 deposit, those looking to illuminate their homes have one year to pay for the package through mobile money transfers as low as .50 cents.
The company traces its origins to the work of co-founders Jesse Moore and Nick Hughes at Vodafone. The European telecommunications giant is the parent of the Kenyan telecom Safaricom — which provides the M-Pesa digital finance product.
“M-KOPA’s germination goes back to those early days of M-Pesa. We began to see that …mobile money would set up the rails upon which other businesses like ours could develop,” said Moore, M-KOPA’s chief executive.
After its first funding round, M-KOPA launched in 2012, forming a U.S. LLC for investment purposes while opening subsidiaries in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. In East Africa, the company has its own distribution network, including a 1,500-agent sales force and 100 service centers.
To date, M-KOPA has sold more than 300,000 household kits: roughly 260,000 in Kenya, 40,000 in Uganda and 20,000 in Tanzania. Safaricom and M-Pesa remain finance partners in Kenya and Tanzania, while M-KOPA’s Uganda customers can pay their kits off through either MTN Money or Airtel Money.
Moore sees M-KOPA as more than just a utility company. “We don’t fit into a conventional box. We are a mix of a micro-finance, technology, and energy company wrapped up in one,” he said, underscoring the venture’s leasing function and that “kopa” actually means “borrow” in Swahili.
M-KOPA plans to expand its country, client and product base over the coming years. One unique opportunity is building additional leasing offerings around new lending profiles.
“We are creating credit histories for a large number of customers…[who] didn’t have access to formal financial services before M-KOPA,” said Moore. He noted the company has partnered with Kenya’s Credit Reference Bureau, “creating 75,000 positive credit ratings” from which M-KOPA itself can draw upon.
Moving forward, M-KOPA looks to pair new financing options to more powerful solar charging capacity and additional product packages. In February the company offered its first flat screen TVs.

Moore said to expect solar-powered leasing options geared toward Internet access, smartphones, and tablets. As solar technology improves, this could extend to refrigerators and other household appliances.
M-KOPA projects it will reach one million clients on the continent by 2018. It recently started selling in Ghana through its first licensing arrangement and a local mobile partner.
“This is a different approach for us than having our own offices and staff, but it’s what we are testing toward further expansion,” said Moore.
As for Nigeria — Africa’s largest economy and most populous nation — M-KOPA’s CEO noted the “tremendous potential” but listed a couple of constraints to entry. “It’s a combination of the country’s kerosene subsidies, which make our price point less competitive, and we haven’t seen the same uptake of mobile money, which isn’t a showstopper for our model but definitely something we’d prefer to have,” he said.
M-KOPA’s Moore believes the company will attract more investment toward a billion-dollar valuation and a future IPO.
“We’re moving beyond startup stage, have significant revenue, and we definitely use the possibility of going public as motivation toward building our business.” M-KOPA backers already include Al Gore’s London-based Generation Investment Management ($19 million) and individuals Sir Richard Branson and Steve Case.
Its first three rounds came from Gray Ghost Ventures (GGV), a $60 million impact venture fund headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia.

“We saw early on M-KOPA’s model could be a game changer for low income people. It takes care of their lighting needs, solves the financing problem, and frees up household resources to invest in other things like small businesses or education,” said GGV investor relations manager Jennifer McReynolds.
Many M-KOPA customers were previously paying more per month to light their homes through kerosene. GGV has an active relationship with the company, according to McReynolds, maintaining a board seat as M-KOPA’s first institutional investors.
Moore views Sub-Saharan Africa’s infrastructure gap as an opportunity — only 24 percent of the region’s 800 million have electricity — and believes solar power presents more than a substitute to traditional energy. “We should look at electrifying Africa differently than we did for places like North American 100 years ago.”
M-KOPA’s potential to scale up, Moore believes, is significant because the growth of Africa’s off-grid population will continue to exceed expansion of its conventional power infrastructure.
“From a capital and environmental perspective, solar energy is a more cost-effective and competitive option with the potential to leapfrog grid power on the continent,” he said.

327,Mercedes home batteries are a potential rival for Tesla’s Powerwall,https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/28/mercedes-home-batteries-are-a-potential-rival-for-teslas-powerwall/,2016/04/28,"
The batteries developed for the high demands of all-electric Mercedes-Benz cars are finding a new application as in-home energy storage units. Sound familiar? Yeah, it’s a lot like the Tesla Powerwall.
Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler AG announced that the storage units are being manufactured by its subsidiary Deutsche ACCUMOTIVE (Daimler has a real love of all caps). The batteries are being sold, installed and supported by partners like utility and solar tech companies. That makes sense, because the storage units are usually installed along with solar panels. The units are already available in Germany, and Mercedes says it will be expanding the program internationally.
Up to eight of the columnar 2.5 kWh lithium-ion battery modules can be combined, with a maximum capacity of 20 kWh all together. According to Mercedes, this is enough to capture surplus solar power for later use with “virtually no losses.” The price of the units hasn’t been disclosed, since it can include several components: the unit itself (or two or three), maybe some photovoltaic panels and the installation.
Deutsche ACCUMOTIVE has been making units like this since 2015 for industrial uses. The systems were designed to be scalable; thus the quick entry into the private home market. Daimler is banking on its energy storage subsidiary in a big way — it’s invested more than $500 million in a second battery factory at the Deutsche ACCUMOTIVE site that will begin operating in the summer of 2017.
As a comparison, the Tesla Energy Powerwall serves the same purpose, with arguably more style. The Powerwall has 6.4 kWh of energy storage “for daily cycle applications,” according to the website. Like the Mercedes units, these can be installed in multiples for solar systems that need to store more energy. We do know how much the Powerwall costs — $3,500. We also know that demand was high, with a reported 38,000 reservations when the Powerwall was announced last year. That level of demand seems to leave plenty of room for a competitor like Daimler AG to jump in with its road-tested battery technology this year.

328,Monoprice sets its sights on outdoor gear brick and mortar stores,https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/27/monoprice-sets-its-sights-on-outdoor-gear-brick-and-mortar-stores/,2016/04/27,"
If you don’t buy your cables (yes, some of us still use cables) from Monoprice, you disappoint me. But while the online retailer got its start with cables and components (and component cables), it’s been expanding for years into dozens of electronics categories — and the latest is gear for your trips to the great outdoors.
Specifically, Monoprice’s “Pure Outdoor” line takes aim at the likes of GoalZero and Anker. In fact, the Monoprice foldable solar panel is a dead ringer for Anker’s well-reviewed PowerPort Solar Lite, though the former will, naturally, be slightly cheaper — $40 versus the Anker’s $50 or so.
There’s also a larger “power cache” with a much more capacious battery. It’s more in competition with GoalZero’s Yeti series: full-on grounded plugs and enough juice to charge your laptop a few times. Expect to pay $180 for the privilege — this might be more of an emergency kit/go bag option.
In addition to the solar gear and camping accessories, Monoprice is looking to get into the cycling market — but, strange as it may seem, they’re aiming at the high end.
There are lightweight carbon components — seat posts, handlebars, and wheels — that Monoprice makes, and e-bike conversion kits from third parties will be sold until the company starts making its own.
With electronics brick and mortar stores as rare as hen’s teeth, are outdoor emporiums like Cabela’s and REI as endangered as the big cats and other alpine fauna sought by their very customers? Well, they’ll probably stick around for a while.

329,Willow Hill Ventures will fund and connect agriculture tech startups with farmers,https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/26/willow-hill-ventures-will-fund-and-connect-agriculture-tech-startups-with-famers/,2016/04/26,"
International Farming Corp. and Finistere Ventures have agreed to partner under the moniker Willow Hill Ventures to invest in growth-stage agricultural tech startups.
International Farming Corp. owns and manages land that it, essentially, leases out to commercial farmers, helping them maximize the land’s yield and profitability. Finistere Ventures invests in early-stage tech companies building products for the agriculture industry. Its portfolio includes CropX, ZeaKal and ShopWell.
Willow Hill Ventures intends to make land within International Farming Corp.’s asset base accessible to entrepreneurs who want to test their technologies and science in a real, commercial context.
The idea is to save startups time and hassles in negotiating farm-by-farm to get pilots or beta testing going, explained Finistere Ventures Partner Spencer Maughan.
According to a statement from Willow Hill Ventures, the new fund will eventually invest in: “informatics and big data, novel farm systems, food quality and nutrition, genetics and seed tech that increase the sustainability, profitability and productivity of agriculture. “
Maughan said, “Tech is what propels the land’s value in agriculture, because it propels the yield and costs to operate a given farm. The genesis of this partnership was that we observed farmers increasingly need tech, and tech companies need help scaling their technologies. Right now they go farm gate to farm gate, looking for partners and pilot customers.”

330,Honda and Volvo add more electrification,https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/25/honda-and-volvo-add-more-electrification/,2016/04/25,"
Honda announced it’s going to expand its Clarity line to include an all-electric version and a plug-in hybrid next year. The latest version of the Honda Clarity will be available later this year any way you want it, as along as you want a fuel-cell vehicle. The other two variants will be ready in 2017.
Honda’s goal is to have electrified vehicles, including plug-in hybrids and fuel cells, account for two-thirds of its total sales by 2030. Right now, you can buy a Honda Fit EV or an Accord Hybrid, so adding two more models nearly doubles Honda’s electrified offerings, to be Pollyanna-ish about it.
Keep in mind that all three Clarity versions are still niche vehicles. Fuel-cell vehicles are pretty much restricted to southern California, where there’s infrastructure to support the new technology. All-electric vehicles have a bit more reach, as many metro areas in the United States are expanding charging infrastructure, but that change is slow in coming. Plug-in hybrids have the most potential for reaching the heartland, as there’s a regular gasoline engine to fall back on after a few miles of all-electric travel. Errands and short commutes can be completed almost entirely on electric power in most plug-in hybrids, but if you live in Montana or Kansas, you’re going to be glad you have a gasoline engine on board.
On the same day, Volvo announced it will have two hybrid versions of every vehicle in its fleet, and it will release its first fully electric vehicle in 2019. In the press release, company president Hakan Samuelsson said, “Volvo wants to be at the forefront of this shift to electrification.” Given that so many other manufacturers already have at least one hybrid model, if not several, on the road, and there are a dozen or more electric vehicles a person could choose from right now in 2016, that “forefront” ship has already sailed.
Volvo is not known for moving quickly and providing a lot of flash, though, so it’s not out of corporate character to spend years preparing for a change this huge. They’ve created two vehicle architectures — one large, one small — that can be fitted with either a hybrid, plug-in hybrid or electric powertrain. The first vehicle to get the electrification treatment is the XC90 T8 Twin Engine SUV, which will be available soon, with the S90 full-size sedan to follow. Volvo’s goal is to have 1 million electrified vehicles on the road by 2025 — the same year the company hopes to be climate neutral.

331,Drastic disruptions are underway in the energy market,https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/22/drastic-disruptions-are-underway-in-the-energy-market/,2016/04/22,"

Contributor


Scott Elrod is a vice president of the hardware systems laboratory at PARC, a Xerox company. 


It’s 6AM and I’m rolling out of bed. But before my feet hit the floor, my “home energy management agent” is negotiating with the California Independent System Operator (ISO), the nerve center controlling the flow of electricity on the grid.
Normally, I’d get my coffee first and then jump in the shower. But my personal agent has alerted me to the fact that a hair-trigger condition has developed! There is a hydro plant in the Sierras getting ready to ramp up production to meet the morning demand. I’ve already told my agent that it’s OK to request that I rearrange my schedule in modest ways, so it’s concluded that if I (and enough other homeowners!) can hold back on energy consumption for 10 more minutes, the hydro turbines won’t need to open, and the reservoir won’t need to be drained further.
[One of my passions is kayaking in the lakes and reservoirs of the Sierras, and I hate to see the water level drop.] As I jump out of bed, a text suggests that I “shower first, then coffee!”
With an aggregate impact of small decisions made by homeowners like me all over the state, we succeeded in averting the need for that reservoir to drain further…at least for today. This vision will become reality. But for now, we lack the ability to directly influence our energy sources, and we certainly have no way to express environmental priorities in such transactions.
When you flipped on your light switch this morning, where did that energy come from? What were the environmental impacts of its generation, transmission and use?
All energy sources have externalities that many of us are passionate about: emissions from burning fossil fuels, groundwater contamination related to oil and natural gas extraction, impacts on fish migration for hydropower and desert habitat disruption for solar, just to name a few.
Unfortunately, there is no way, today, for the full set of impacts of our energy use to be collected, and no way for people to express their values and communicate them to system operators, so that they can be incorporated into decision-making.
How would you balance the benefits you derive from your energy use with the true economic and environmental costs, if you had that information and could choose exactly where your energy comes from?
There are, though, emerging technologies that will alter these legacy dynamics. Instead of captive consumers with few energy choices, we are fast becoming active participants in the energy markets as generators, demand-response agents and ancillary service providers. Our energy resource mix is increasingly coming under our control as we put solar on our rooftops and proactively shift our demand from gas-powered to electric vehicles or our home energy mix between electricity and natural gas.
The cost of energy storage continues to decline, promising increased flexibility in the way we use power from renewable sources. New sensing and analytics technologies allow us to monitor and measure environmental impacts and energy use benefits to a degree never before achievable.
These trends are evident as utilities such as Con Edison allow customers to choose electricity only generated by renewables.
Companies like Whirlpool and others are making smart appliances that interact with Nest thermostats to reduce energy by helping consumers find the best time of day to run. And, commercial-building owners can make money providing demand-side control and ancillary services through network aggregators like EnerNoc.

As these capabilities proliferate, they have the potential to coalesce into an integrated system with great flexibility and potential for savings, and even the possibility to make money.
While these changes promise opportunity for better energy choices, they may also bring some risk. A comprehensive perspective is needed to provide new frameworks and advanced information systems that can help us manage this complexity and guide us toward diverse energy and environmental policy goals.
The democratization of information energy
There are strong similarities between today’s energy systems and the information technology of the 1960s. The mainframe computer of that era was a valuable shared resource, but due to the non-intuitive interface, control of the computing resource was isolated from the workers who used it to support their tasks.
There was a group of intermediaries, experts in machine language, and end users had to coordinate with them to access the computer. Decisions about utilization priorities, methods and investments were generally far removed from the end users, just as is the case with today’s power grid.
In the 1970s, PARC and other Silicon Valley innovators shattered this model and launched the information revolution with the invention of the personal computer, graphical user interface and Ethernet connectivity.
Together, we developed the technologies and practices that put computing into the hands of business users and consumers, providing unprecedented direct access to information and the ability to optimize computers for specific needs.
This transition from mainframe to personal computing is often referred to as the Democratization of Information. Today, anyone can access knowledge on any subject, irrespective of economic or social status. The economic benefit of this transformation is measured in trillions of dollars, with impacts that have touched every aspect of our society.

Today we see signs that the energy market is set for this type of dramatic disruption.
New technologies and markets are allowing energy consumers to gain direct control over energy resources. It is impossible to predict all of the implications and value that will ultimately be created when control of energy is placed directly in the hands of users, but it is nearly certain that it will lead to a period of tremendous innovation, economic growth and job creation.
This type of disruption is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and the timing couldn’t be better in the context of accelerating our efforts to address impending climate change.
I am a technology innovator, and I’m also a lover of nature. It matters to me where my power comes from and I want to better understand how the little choices I make can improve (or at the very least, not harm) the world I live in and enjoy. What energy choices would you make if you were able?

332,Superspin research project aims to drive more energy efficient computing,https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/15/superspin-research-project-aims-to-drive-more-energy-efficient-computing/,2016/04/15,"
Scientists at Cambridge University are working on combining two fields of solid state physics research, spintronics and superconductors, in order to develop what they hope could become the foundation for the next generation of datacenter technology — perhaps within the next decade.
Data centers are the engines of the digital economy. But they are also very energy intensive in their own right — with the researchers citing estimates that some three per cent of the power generated in Europe is already being used by data centers.
One impetus for the research is therefore to apply ‘superspin’ technology to substantially reduce the power consumption of high performance computing and data storage. Superconductors allow for the propagation of electrical charge without electronic resistance, and therefore hold out the tantalizing promise — in computing kit terms — of carrying electronic charge with zero energy loss.
Albeit, at this stage in the research, there is still a question mark over whether the cooling requirements of utilizing superconductors will result in less energy consumption overall or not. Hence the need for further research.
“Superconductivity necessarily requires low temperature,” explains Dr Jason Robinson, one of the project leads. “No one has discovered room temperature superconductivity.
“The crunch question is: is the energy required to cool going to be smaller than current energy loss due to the energy efficiency of spintronics. If it costs more to cool than it currently does in terms of what we lose, currently, then it’s not worth it. That’s what we’re exploring.”
“Our basic calculations suggest that superconducting spintronics will be massively more energy efficient than current spintronics,” he adds.
Another driver for the research is to use superspin as a possible alternative to semiconductor technology — as a new route to sustain Moore’s Law of shrinking electronics, just as the ability of engineers to pack more transistors onto integrated circuits is starting to look like it’s coming to the end of the road. Spintronics proposes utilizing the spin alignment of electrons as a medium to store (the 0 or 1 of) digital data.
“Information technology now is based on such small objects you just can’t use conventional superconductors,” notes Robinson. “By combining superconductivity with spintronics it’s not only that you can create circuits without [energy] dissipation, but it’s that you create new physics. So that means there’s a lot of new opportunities created through this combination.
“There’s a lot of undiscovered physics to be explored.”
The Cambridge-led project has received a £2.7 million grant from the UK’s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, with a focus on developing a superconducting spintronics prototype device over the next five years to prove out their theoretical modeling that the combined tech is indeed more energy efficient than just using spintronics.
“It’s important to understand that this is the first ever superconductivity and spintronics funded program,” adds Robinson. “The way the grant has been set up in the first three years there’s a series of parallel projects. Some are more applications biased than others but the application stuff has to develop alongside the science… Everything we do is moving us towards the prototype.”
“It’s a fundamental program with the aim of triggering applications in spintronics. There’s a lot of science we don’t currently understand and we need to understand in order to be able to make the best possible prototype. We have enough science to know that we can make a prototype. The question is can we make the best prototype,” he adds.  “[And] what do we need to do in order to be able to make a device that’s switchable — that you can not only store information on, but you can process information with as well.”
The project draws on prior research conducted at Cambridge, and elsewhere, to combine spintronics and superconductors — a feat previously thought to be impossible, thanks to superconductivity canceling out electronic spin.
However the same research group at Cambridge found a workaround for that, involving magnets. Initially utilizing a layer of a rare earth magnetic material — although the group has since proved that various magnetic materials can be used, according to Robinson.
“A few years ago our group discovered that actually if you combine supercomputers with magnets you can create a new kind of Cooper Pair [paired electrons], which instead of having two electrons with anti-parallel spins you can create pairs which have parallel line spins. So now you have both the benefits of superconductivity and the ability to carry spin in the superconducting state.”
Another area he is excited about from the combination of superconductivity and spintronics is the potential for using the technique to further quantum computing.
“It introduces lots of new ideas that were not possible previously. So that’s exciting, and indeed a large part of our grant is to develop the science of those other areas as well,” he adds.

333,"Bosch, Flextronics back CropX to help farmers grow more food without wasting water",https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/12/bosch-flextronics-back-cropx-to-help-farmers-feed-the-world-efficiently/,2016/04/12,"A Tel Aviv startup that wants to help farmers produce more food with fewer resources, CropX, has attracted sensor manufacturers Robert Bosch and Flextronics International as strategic backers.
Specifically, Robert Bosch Venture Capital GmbH and accelerator Flex Lab IX added $1 million in venture funding to the Series A round for CropX, which now totals $10 million.
CropX makes soil sensors and irrigation controllers for use on commercial farms. It also makes an app to help farmers interpret all the data they gather, and make choices about how to treat their land.
CropX CEO and founder Isaac Bentwich, a medical doctor by training, and formerly the CEO of Rosetta Genomics, compared CropX’s technology to personalized medicine.
He said, “As we are not all supposed to take the same pills for a headache, land is not homogenous or even. If you water it evenly, you’re actually over-irrigating one part and under-watering another.”
CropX products work with the existing pivot irrigation systems– or big, slow-moving sprinklers– that are already used on a majority of commercial farms today, and that would be costly for farmers to replace.
The company’s mission is to help the agriculture industry feed the world without wasting water, or dumping unneeded fertilizer, pesticides and herbicides into the ground, says Bentwich.
That’s going to take both research and development and hardware manufacturing help. That’s why Bentwich sought the involvement of Bosch and Flextronics as investors, he said. “Our new strategic partners can help us source supply for our hardware, and could even influence the design of new sensors that could go into our products in the future.”
CropX tech is already being used at 20 row crop farms in four states in the U.S., encompassing some 5,000 acres. In the past growing season at those farms, yields increased up to 10 bushels per acre of corn, using 30% less water than in prior seasons, the company reports.
Founded in 2013, CropX is rolling out a new-generation “DIY” soil sensor this week, one that can be screwed into the ground, and properly installed in about four minutes.
Early investor in CropX, Arama Kukutai, a Partner with Finistere Ventures and a lifelong farmer himself, said the company is doing better than he expected it would at this early stage. He attributed part of that to the cost savings CropX promises.
Additionally, he said, “Farming is generally a conservative industry when it comes to adopting new technology. But it’s become harder to hire skilled labor in the industry, too. So it’s very useful when you can have one person sitting in an office on a farm, driving 100 different pivot irrigation systems from their iPad.”
While the company has focused on row crop farming to-date, Kukutai said its hardware and agricultural analytics platform could serve well in any water-stressed region, and for higher-value crops like nuts, berries or wine grapes.
“When every irrigation inch is precious, like it is in places like California, you don’t mind spending a little on analytics up front to get a gain and save money,” Kukutai said.

334,Marijuana deliverer Meadow rolls up $2.1M for dispensary sales software,https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/05/from-farm-to-joint/,2016/04/05,"
Meadow already lets you get a prescription for medical marijuana over video chat and order from a nearby shop that delivers. Now it wants to be the backbone of the weed business, too. Pot dispensaries can’t use standard point-of-sale or inventory software because they aren’t compliant with the industry’s strict regulations.
So over the last year, since graduating Y Combinator, Meadow has been raising a $2.1 million seed round on a rolling basis to build out specialized cannabis sales software. Today it announced the round is sealed, with participation from ex SV Angel David Lee, YC’s Justin Kan, Reddit’s Steve Huffman, Kissmetrics’ Hiten Shah, Slow Ventures, SOMA Capital and Poseidon Asset Management.
Meadow’s point-of-sale software for marijuana dispensaries
The cash will help Meadow build out weed-friendly alternatives to QuickBooks and Square, and pay for marketing to smoke its big competitor Eaze. Next, it wants to keep working up the supply chain to build software for every part of the business, from farm to joint.
High without the headache
“I’ve been smoking since high school, and it’s always made me feel great” co-founder David Hua tells me. The expectedly super-chill entrepreneur explains that “it’s helped me in so many different ways,” and now he wants to help others provide everything from psychoactive euphoria to pain relief in pot form.
Meadow’s founders, with David Hua on the right
Hua was the head of platform at Sincerely, which let people turn their camera phone photos into gift cards and other physical products. But after Sincerely was acquired by Provide Commerce, he craved more of the startup life, and left with some co-workers to devise a new venture. They brainstormed everything from landlord-tenant software to shift management for small businesses, “but ultimately those ideas petered out. We weren’t totally passionate about it.”
Then Hua visited Oaksterdam, a marijuana entrepreneur academy in Oakland, California where he met Debby Goldsberry, founder of pioneering dispensary Berkeley Patients Group. Her day-to-day business sounded hellish because of how much she had to do manually or with a Frankenstein-combination of generic software.
Meanwhile, Hua was frustrated by the few medical marijuana delivery services, which he tells me had outdated menus, inaccurate delivery times and felt insecure. “They’d say they’d come in 2 to 4 hours, or on ‘friday afternoon’ and you’re just sitting and waiting,” he gripes. “And I didn’t feel comfortable emailing my ID and doctor’s recommendation to a random email address or texting it.” So his squad decided to start Meadow.
Prescription, delivery, software
Meadow never handles marijuana itself. Hua refers to it as an ancillary service. That makes the whole business cleaner and simpler to fund. Today Meadow has three strains of revenue.
Its original business is a directory of nearby marijuana dispensaries that do deliveries. Meadow makes it simple to upload your prescription paperwork, browse up-to-date menus, learn about and compare different types of pot, fill a shopping cart and get delivery in well under an hour. It earns around a 10 percent fee on transactions from dispensaries for delivering them customers, and now has serviced about 38 percent of zip codes in California.
Meadow’s online delivery storefront
But many customers don’t have their prescription already, or it’s expired after a year. There’s a big business in states that have legalized medicinal marijuana where doctors in dingy offices ask a few vague questions about what ails you (stress? back pain? insomnia?), take $50 to $100 from you and write you a prescription on the spot. Still, it requires an annoying physical visit somewhere that might not be close or comfortable.
Meadow went a step further with Meadow MD. At first, they let users schedule a doctor to come to their house to do the dance and get prescribed. Hua says Meadow’s first doc actually rode around San Francisco on an electric skateboard.
But now for $100 you can instantly be connected to a doctor over HIPAA-compliant video chat and get your prescription fired over to you electronically, in minutes. That gets slid over to Meadow’s delivery directory and suddenly you’ve gone from illegal pot wanter to legal pot smoker in an hour. It’s more expensive than competitor Eaze’s $40 video prescription service, but Meadow’s directory visitors are so hyped to buy pot they might not go looking elsewhere.
Meadow’s iPad-compatible dispensary software
Where Hua sees the not-so-hazy future of Meadow’s business is software. First there’s its online menu system that it says boosts average order size by more than 50 percent. Dispensaries can embed the menu on their own sites or let people buy through Meadow, track their delivery people in real time and message with customers.
For in-store purchases, Meadow also makes an iPad-based point-of-sale system similar to Square POS or Revel, but designed for compliance with medical marijuana laws that require strict tracking of how much pot gets sold to whom. Its analytics show which products are bought most, and helps stores manage inventory so they never run out of what’s selling.
Hua relays rumors of Intuit and Square giving marijuana businesses a hard time or even kicking them off their services. So Meadow plans to use its new cash to keep expanding its monthly fee SAAS platform, and assist dispensaries with more of their finance, payroll and other back office problems.

Hua is understandably relaxed in general. But when asked about his biggest fear for his company, he says it is a delivery driver routed by Meadow injuring a pedestrian, and the ensuing fallout like “people calling for over-regulation and more safety checks and things that are beyond our control.” As for competitors like Eaze, he repeats a popular YC adage that “99% of startups die by suicide” rather than being murdered by other startups.
There’s plenty of green fields for Meadow and the other marijuana startups. Millions of people smoke every day, and the habit can add up to hundreds of dollars in weed a month. Legal pot sales climbed over $5 billion in 2015, and that’s sure to rise as more states allow medicinal and recreational usage.

Hua hopes that if Meadow can nurture the business of pot, the taxes generated will convince more states to decriminalize the plant. He believes that could keep non-violent, often minority offenders out of jail and get actually sick patients medicine with fewer worrisome side-effects than pain killers and other drugs.
Eighty years ago when alcohol prohibition was repealed, it created a gold rush that spawned an enormous range of businesses. Now we’re on the cusp of the green rush, and Meadow wants to make the transition cushy.

335,Don’t hand over EV charging in Northern California to PG&E,https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/31/dont-hand-over-ev-charging-in-northern-california-to-pge/,2016/03/31,"

Scott Mercer is the CEO of Volta.


Northern California has become a test bed for electric vehicle charging. It’s no accident; the region is home to more electric vehicles and EV charging stations than anywhere else in the country. Like other innovative industries, the EV charging models, products and services that prove successful over time will scale around the state, the country and the world.
EV charging companies compete to provide tailored EV charging equipment and services — based on different business models, hardware, speed, parking management and networking capabilities — to large employers, local governments and retail outlets. And those organizations have the power to set prices to incentivize drivers’ behavior.
That’s why a proposal from PG&E is so deeply troubling. The utility wants to insert itself right in the middle of the booming electric vehicle charging market in Northern California. It’s seeking approval from the California Public Utility Commission for broad control over the market in a way that will crowd out private investment, stifle innovation, and harm customers. The CPUC should either reject or substantially revise this proposal.
PG&E is seeking monopoly authority over EV charging in northern California. Under PG&E’s scheme, it would put in place 7,600 charging stations across northern California, and ratepayers would foot the bill. But here’s the rub: the proposal would cost ratepayers triple what it costs the private sector, and it is three times as large as the CPUC has called for.
What’s worse, PG&E would have sole authority to determine which companies can participate in the program and the rates they would charge. And for the fastest, most innovative charging stations (DC Fast Chargers), there would be absolutely no competition. This is a recipe for disaster.
There’s no question that PG&E has a significant role to play, and we all share the vision of a vast network of charging stations across the region. But how we achieve this is critically important.
Like other utilities in the state, PG&E should provide the basic “make ready” infrastructure — bringing wires, and conduits to parking spaces around the region. Then, electric vehicle companies could compete based on speed, quality, networked capabilities and a range of features.
Ultimately, the goal is to have an EV charging infrastructure in place that accelerates the shift away from fossil fuels and toward clean electricity. The full potential of EV charging has yet to be realized. But that’s why it is so important that one utility — which doesn’t have innovation in its DNA — shouldn’t have the power to dictate how the market works.
As the California Public Utilities Commission considers how to resolve this case, we urge it to preserve customer choice by ensuring a competitive and innovative market. We look forward to working closely with the utility, so it can focus on providing safe and reliable electricity service, and we can focus on developing products and services that make it possible for California to remain the leader in electric vehicles and electric vehicle charging.

This morning, the Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Volkswagen Group of America, charging that it “deceived customers with the advertising campaign it used to promote its supposedly ‘clean diesel’ VWs and Audis,” according to the FTC press release. As I’m sure you recall, these are the vehicles that were caught cheating on emissions tests in October 2015.
The lawsuit seeks damages for any Americans who bought or leased one of the Volkswagens or Audis from 2008 to 2015. It also asks that Volkswagen not deceive consumers anymore, a lesson it seems they’ve learned in the past six months.
The FTC says that Volkswagen advertised its diesel vehicles as being low-emissions, environmentally friendly cars that would retain their resale value. More than half a million Americans thought that sounded pretty good and purchased or leased diesel VWs and Audis over those seven years.
In particular, the lawsuit notes that these cars were advertised as being “50-state compliant,” meaning that they would pass emissions tests everywhere in the country, even in the toughest states, like California. And they certainly did pass those tests, but not honestly.
When the cars detected that they were being tested for emissions in the lab, which is the usual way they’re tested, a few lines of code changed the way the engine behaved to emit fewer pollutants. When cars were driven on the road, the engine would optimize for performance and sacrifice emissions. When they were tested on the road using probes in the tailpipe, nitrous oxide emissions were as much as 35 times the standard, as discovered by the International Council on Clean Transportation with help from West Virginia University’s Center for Alternative Fuels, Engines and Emissions. The lawsuit charges that this was an unfair practice.
You probably know if you’re one of the consumers affected, but in case you’re unsure, the lawsuit covers 2009 through 2015 Volkswagen TDI Jettas, Passats, and Touaregs, plus all Audi TDI vehicles for those years. The average price of these vehicles was $28,000, and the FTC is suing for compensation for anyone who purchased one of these vehicles at any price.

337,Tech and policy can make Bill Gates’ ‘energy miracle’ a reality,https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/26/tech-and-policy-can-make-bill-gatess-energy-miracle-a-reality/,2016/03/26,"

Brandon Tinianov is on the national Advisory Council of the U.S. Green Building Council and vice president of business development at View.


With icons like Leonardo DiCaprio and Bill Gates using their powerful brands and personal convictions to turn the world’s focus toward the crisis of climate change and the long-lever arm of energy efficiency, it’s time for policy makers and practitioners to get serious about finding ways to take better care of our planet.
In his most recent annual letter co-authored with his wife, Gates went so far as to say we need “an energy miracle” to solve this global crisis.
Turning our attention to buildings as a significant emissions source could be one way to effectively address Gates’ concerns about energy consumption. Residential and commercial buildings account for more than 40 percent of total U.S. energy consumption. Innovation in this arena could have sizable impact on a national energy strategy.
However, a vast majority of the national building stock is privately held and subject to regional market forces and near-term profitability. This is a place where thoughtful state and national policies can play an important role in curbing our national emissions.
While government intervention is often opposed in principle, national building policies actually create long-term confidence to develop innovative building components and design strategies. Take California’s Title 24 Building Energy Code, a great example of how we can reform our building standards to help curb energy use.
Thanks to the energy efficiency standards in this progressive policy, which have continually been updated since 1978, Californians use half the energy of other Americans nationwide on a per capita basis. Furthermore, that same policy has made California an ideal early market for now ubiquitous technologies such as compact fluorescent light bulbs, LEDs, low-albedo roofs and small-scale solar.
When given the choice, owners and renters choose the most efficient buildings available.
California is now ambitiously targeting Net Zero Energy (NZE) for all new residential construction by 2020 and all new commercial construction by 2030. Although some states are beginning to adopt forward-thinking regulations like Title 24, acceleration of building efficiency requirements could make a big dent in energy use, as buildings carry a larger carbon footprint than the industrial or transportation sectors.
In this election year, both sides of the aisle are debating which energy policies should last into the next presidency. While the topic of climate change has become over-politicized, disagreements take away from the real issue at hand and the positive impact the guiding hand of the government can have on the built environment.
On the surface, it can appear putting these policies into action could be harmful to a private real estate market, but the opposite is actually true. As evidenced by collaborations like the Mathilda project in Sunnyvale, California, progressive developers can voluntarily undertake market attractive NZE buildings that cost less to build and rent for a premium. Completed in 2015, Mathilda is a blueprint structure for NZE and Zero Net Carbon building that leverages eight innovative building technologies, including advanced comfort controls and dynamic windows.
These technologies, and their application at Mathilda, demonstrate the power that the Internet of Things, nanotechnology, smart systems and next-generation architectural thinking can have when deployed in concert for the purposes of net-zero construction.

Getting specific, Mathilda offers unique insight into how barriers to green building are being removed:
Profitability. A common objection to high-performance building is the perception of additional upfront costs. While it’s true that initial construction costs were higher, this cost was significantly outweighed by the near-term benefits of reduced operating expenses, accelerated lease-up and premium rent over the life of the occupant’s lease. This is a critical aspect of making sustainable building a practical economic reality.
Flexibility. While new construction is the primary focus of building efficiency policy, it is equally important that existing buildings can be retrofitted to achieve NZE status. Mathilda’s renovation transformed a 40-year-old two-story racquetball club into a Class B+ commercial office NZE structure. This, too, is an important consideration as we think about remaking the built environment on a sustainable model.
Scalability. To achieve true scale, NZE strategies must be broadly replicable. Using an integrated package of “state of the shelf” building technologies, the Mathilda approach has already spawned clones and is applicable for a wide variety of commercial and residential buildings. This requires both technologies and policies to scale.
Projects like Mathilda highlight the ability of the construction industry and building occupants to thrive in a progressive policy environment. Legislators need to recognize that industry is ready for their mandate to make buildings as efficient as possible. Building technology is ready and designers have the experience and ingenuity to use them to their greatest benefit. And, when given the choice, owners and renters choose the most efficient buildings available. With these in place, suddenly Mr. Gates’ miracle seems quite possible.

340,"Batteries and all, EVs are greener than gasoline",https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/22/batteries-and-all-evs-are-greener-than-gasoline/,2016/03/22,"
Electric vehicles come out of the gate with green cred. They don’t even have tailpipes because they don’t have any emissions while they’re driving. But do EVs deserve their goody-too-green rep? A report from the Union of Concerned Scientists says they do indeed. Even if you take into account the battery, the manufacturing process and even the recycling and disposal process, EVs are the source of fewer greenhouse gases over their lifetimes than gasoline-powered vehicles.
The UCS modeled the two best-selling all-electric vehicles in the United States, the Nissan Leaf and Tesla Model S, and compared them with an average of gasoline-powered models of similar weight and size, such as the Ford Focus and Audi A8. The Leaf was considered a “mid-size mid-range” vehicle with its 24 kWh battery, while the Model S was a “full-size long-range” car with an 85 kWh battery.
There are two common caveats people mention when talking about the cradle-to-grave emissions of an electric vehicle: the resources required to make the lithium-ion battery and the source of the electricity used to charge the car.
It’s true, according to the UCS study, that manufacturing a lithium-ion battery produces a lot of greenhouse gases. “The larger the battery, the greater the vehicle range; but also the greater the weight added to the vehicle and the greater emissions from manufacturing the battery,” the report notes. So the Tesla battery goes 265 miles on a charge, but it also emits more greenhouse gases to make that battery.
The good news is that emissions-free driving in an EV makes up for those greenhouse gases more quickly than a gasoline-powered car makes up its manufacturing emissions. The Leaf-like car would offset those emissions in 4,900 miles of driving, and the modeled Model S would take 19,000 miles, using the average U.S. electricity grid mix as a source for charging. In both cases, that’s about a 50 percent reduction in emissions compared to the gasoline cars over their lifetimes.
As for the source of the electricity, no matter where you live in the United States, even if your local utility includes coal in the mix, an EV will produce lower global warming emissions than the average new gasoline powered car getting 29 mpg. Coal use is dropping, though, so in two-thirds of the country, driving an EV will have lower emissions over its lifetime than a 50-mpg gasoline car.
So even with the admittedly emissions-intensive process of manufacturing the battery and the possibility of using coal to charge up every night, the UCS found that modern EVs are cleaner from cradle to grave and well to wheels than most gasoline-powered vehicles on the road today. EVs still aren’t for everyone — if your commute involves mountain passes or sub-zero temperatures, you might want to hold off. But if you were looking for one more reason to go electric, this might be it.

342,The Hotaru compact shower can reuse the same five gallons of water for two weeks,https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/15/the-hotaru-compact-shower-can-reuse-the-same-five-gallons-of-water-for-two-weeks/,2016/03/15,"
Sustainability was a trend I picked up on this year as I met with several startups at SXSW 2016. One company that clearly falls into that category is Hotaru, which created a water-recycling portable shower.
The early-stage hardware startup, based in Tokyo, received an undisclosed amount of angel funding from Taizo Son. Their compact shower product works by using multiple water reservoirs to store and purify water. I spoke with CEO/co-founder Riki Kitagawa and co-founder Ryo Yamada; they claim their device can recover 95-98 percent of the water used in the shower.
In operation, it holds five gallons of water. According to the co-founders, a family of three can each take a daily five-minute shower using the same five gallons of water for up to two weeks.
The compact shower can be easily deployed in any area. It does require a power source, but Riki and Ryo told me that you can hook it up to a car for basic power to run it (unheated water). To power the water heater, a generator or AC hookup is needed.
Hotaru is focused on a concept they call “water freedom.” This freedom of being able to live anywhere — even in locations where plumbing or access to water treatment is not available — is achieved by personalizing  water treatment.
Obviously, outdoor living, military or travel uses come to mind for this concept (more showers on airplanes anyone?). However, when I contemplate the sheer waters savings that could be achieved, even in a residential setting, from a system like this, it seems pretty powerful.
Making sure the water remains purified is obviously a concern, and they are taking that challenge very seriously. The shower is outfitted with various sensors and alerts to maintain that level of purification.

The team was hilariously enough demonstrating the product on the trade-floor show by taking showers (with clothes on of course).
We were not able to discuss planned pricing or market availability at the time of publication.
UPDATE: I heard back from Hotaru; they plan to have the product in market in 2017 for $3,000.

344,GenZe 2.0 electric scooter brings electric power to the people,https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/11/genze-2-0-electric-scooter-brings-electric-power-to-the-people/,2016/03/11,"
Mahindra, the India-based manufacturing giant, wants to offer more people the chance at a cleaner commute. The GenZe 2.0 electric scooter carries one person, a couple big bags of groceries, and a price tag of just $3,000. As a former scooter commuter myself (on a 50-cc gasoline-powered bike), I was eager to take the GenZe 2.0 on a weekend-long test drive.
Electric vehicles have a lot of appeal – they use no gasoline, they emit no greenhouse gasses, they’re quiet, and they recharge as easily as your phone. But they’re expensive. A Tesla Model S, without including tax credits or five years of fuel cost savings, starts at $75,000. A Nissan Leaf starts at $29,010. Even an electric motorcycle like the race-tested Victory Empulse TT is $20,000. There’s a certain income level required to get away from gasoline. That’s why the GenZe 2.0 is so special.
GenZe has a shop on a busy thoroughfare in Portland, Oregon, where I picked up my test scooter. I was shown how to unlock the scooter via password using the weatherproof touchscreen, and how to unlock the removable battery. Then I put the kickstand up and headed out onto the street.
Besides merely driving the scooter, there are several things to play with on the 7-inch screen, preferably in your driveway or at a stop light. There are three programmed driving modes: Safe, for newbies; Econo for maximizing battery power; and Sport for a little extra zip. Advanced users can set individual parameters, like the regenerative braking system, to their liking for more aggressive performance or better battery management.
The GenZe gets about 30 miles per charge, which I found to be true no matter how I drove it. That’s in part because not even the Sport mode overcomes the scooter’s 30 mph governor. It’s enough for getting around town, which is the point of this scooter, but it is frustrating to feel the motor spin up and then just kind of settle at 30 mph.
But 30 mph is good enough for most city streets, which is exactly the kind of driving the GenZe is designed to do. You could easily commute to work and home in an urban area at 30 mph or less, and probably using one 30-mile charge. But if you need more range or your parking space is nowhere near an outlet, that’s where the removable SmartPack battery comes in. Unlock it and slide it out. The battery is really heavy, but the handle is padded. It’s fine for a short carry to the nearest 110-volt outlet, and it fully recharges in about three and a half hours.
GenZe gets groceries
 
I took the GenZe grocery shopping to test the capacity of the zip-top Back Bay mounted behind the seat. It easily fit two large canvas shopping bags full of food—no squashed loaves of bread or crushed tortilla chips. There’s also a charger built into the cargo bin for cell phones and laptops. The seat is large and comfy, though as a short rider, I did have to move forward quite a bit when waiting at red lights to get my feet solidly in contact with the ground.
The GenZe has a solid feel, and like most electric vehicles, it is nearly silent. It’s not speedy, but it is fun and surprisingly versatile for city dwellers. And the $3,000 price tag reaches Mahindra’s goal of putting an electric vehicle within reach of more people globally.

345,Solar financing platform Wunder raises $3.6M,https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/08/solar-financing-platform-wunder-raises-3-6-million/,2016/03/08,"
Wunder Capital, a provider of solar financing for medium-sized businesses, has raised $3.6 million in a new round of financing. The company has raised $4.7 million from Techstars Ventures, Fenway Summer Ventures, and FinTech Collective, alongside existing seed investors.
Wunder, a financial services company for the solar industry, graduated from Techstars in 2014.
The founders of Wunder don’t come from a traditional financial technology or renewable energy background. The three co-founders of the company cut their teeth in advertising and marketing technology companies on the East and West Coasts, according to co-founder and chief executive Bryan Birsic.
According to Birsic, Wunder is lending to an incredibly underserved portion of the solar generation market. While the amount of grid-scale solar generation has quadrupled and residential solar installations have doubled, the number of small-scale projects priced at roughly $500,000 have only grown by 25 percent.
These smaller installations represent a large chunk of commercial real-estate, and by unlocking the financing for these funds, installations by these companies could skyrocket, or so Wunder’s thinking goes.
Accredited investors can tap this market by investing in two Wunder Capital funds: an income fund and a bridge fund, where participating accredited investors can put up money for stakes in solar projects at annualized returns of somewhere between 6 percent and 11 percent.
The company sources its solar projects by working with the installers, developers and distributors who will be receiving the company’s money.
“Wunder’s platform represents a new era of alternative lender, the vertically-­integrated lender. They address critical issues of customer acquisition, underwriting, and support with unique capabilities specific to the commercial solar industry. We could not be more pleased to add Wunder to our portfolio of alternative lenders and to bring Wunder direct access to our deep capital markets network,” said Brooks Gibbons of the Fintech Collective in a statement.

Will The Paris Climate Change Deal Prove To Be The Catalyst For Cleantech?




For the last 15 years, the Cleantech Forum has been organized by the Cleantech Group. Most recently it took place in San Francisco on January 25-27, 2016. Energy storage, China and the Internet of Things (IoT) were key topics at the forum, with investors and entrepreneurs confident on their respective futures.
Energy storage, in particular, was keenly discussed, with Vic Shao, CEO at Green Charge Networks, predicting “2016 will be the year of deployment for storage.” Anticipation around storage deployment has been gathering for a few years now. In 2014, Navigant Research predicted that worldwide revenue from energy storage would increase from $675 million in 2014 to $15.6 billion in 2024. Last year, Deutsche Bank reported that technological advancement could make energy storage a solution that could be deployed on a large scale within the next five years.
Andrew Beebe, Managing Director at Obvious Ventures, sees similarities between energy storage today and solar energy a decade ago. “Energy storage is just like solar panels were 10 years ago. We are at an early stage of that process, but what we are about to see in storage is what solar did a few years ago,” says Beebe.
While Silicon Valley has been the driving force behind major breakthroughs in storage technology, the development of energy storage has also been moving forward north of the border.
Canada’s largest province has been building up its energy storage system. 
For the past few years, Canada’s largest province (similar to a state), Ontario, has been building up its energy storage system. Strong interest from Ontario’s utility sector and a supportive ecosystem for cleantech, developed by both the national and provincial governments, have enabled Ontario to establish a lead in energy storage.
Tom Rand, Managing Partner at ArcTern Ventures, agreed that while energy storage technology is developing well, more work still remains in understanding the characteristics of this new asset. “We’ve established a lead in technology, and are now working to develop operational capacity and awareness in our utility sector,” says Rand.
Toronto-based NRStor, an energy storage project developer, and Hydrostor are two examples of energy storage development in Ontario. Last year, NRStor partnered with Tesla to bring the Powerwall Home Battery to Canada. Likewise, Hydrostor, one of the beneficiaries of the privately backed ArcTern’s investment, is partnering with Toronto Hydro, a municipal electricity distribution company, to develop underwater batteries.
Entrepreneurs keen on Chinese cleantech market, with “partnerships” being critical for business
Lately, China has witnessed major policy developments related to climate change and clean energy. The U.S.-China Climate Agreement, Chinese President Xi Jinping’s announcement of a cap-and-trade system and a leaner and greener five-year plan have created a new model of economic development, which could not only curb energy usage, but also provide opportunities for cleantech entrepreneurs.
Alex Shoer, CEO at Seeder, is one such entrepreneur who is looking to address energy efficiency in buildings. His company provides a marketplace that connects commercial building managers with green technologies for retrofits, as well as the capital to pay for it.
“There’s a huge amount of development, but while there are mandates in terms of efficiency targets and sustainability in buildings, there’s a knowledge and access gap between available solutions, qualified providers and financing options,” says Shoer.
But while Shoer has successfully started operating in China, he points out that entrepreneurs looking to enter the Chinese market need to pay special consideration to building partnerships and relationships.
“In China and in many other developing countries, trust is the most important thing. It takes time and persistence to develop these ‘trust’ relationships, but one way to speed up the process is to work with, or work through, an existing trusted party or marketplace already on the ground,” he says.
The unique nature of doing business in China requires a collective approach to building relationships and trust.
Leo Zhang, Senior Analyst at Cleantech Group, echoes Shoer’s sentiment. He emphasizes that finding the right partner also can help entrepreneurs navigate and enter the market, especially when companies have no presence in China.
“China is heavily relationship-driven, so having local partners will open lots of doors, rather than going into it blindly by yourself. A partner can provide their infrastructure to scale-up the technology, or can be the pilot program to test your product,” says Zhang.
The unique nature of doing business in China requires a collective approach to building relationships and trust. Albin Jourda, founder of French Cleantech, says that French companies are working together to establish these partnerships in China.
“Building partnerships is one of the main challenges French companies may face in China. For this reason, the UMO (Union de Maîtrise d’œuvre), which is a group of six French companies, worked together and signed agreements for a period of 5 years with the city of Chengdu,” says Jourda
Internet of Things (IoT) improves resource efficiency and creates positive impacts
The potential for IoT solutions to be deployed in the energy landscape has created opportunities to drive efficiencies, increase productivity and promote economic growth. Joe Costello, CEO at Enlighted, whose company was named in the 2015 Global Cleantech 100 and also won the North American Company of the Year award, believes that IoT is not only good for the environment and reducing costs, but also for creating new innovative tools for doing business.
“Our clients who use the sensor technology save 50 to 75% of their energy costs,” says Costello, who was named the top American CEO in 1997 by Chief Executive Magazine. Enlighted’s client list includes Google, LinkedIn and HP.
Even for large companies, IoT is gaining importance and being incorporated into their daily business activities.
Costello, does, however, point out that the capital-intensive aspect of implementing sensor technology has hindered growth. To accommodate this, Enlighted created an innovative financing model for its customers. “This type of technology does require a large amount of capital. Small companies would require around $10 million, and large companies $100 million to implement our system. This was our biggest constraint to growth; so we put all the money down for our customers, and they pay us back from the energy savings that the system provides,” he explains.
Through their innovative financing model, called GEO, Enlighted customers receive full energy benefits and have a sensor network that enables them to optimize commercial space with zero upfront cost.
Even for large companies, IoT is gaining importance and being incorporated into their daily business activities. IBM, a company well-known to reshape itself, has made IoT “a major priority” for its business as the company continues to focus on its key growth initiatives.
“IoT is a major priority for IBM, and is one of the new businesses that we have created as the company continues to innovate. IoT holds out the promise of more granular monitoring and optimization of process performance in just about any context — therefore, it will become integral to resource efficiency as one aspect of performance,” says Peter Williams, Chief Technology Officer, Big Green Innovations, at IBM.
Aside from IBM’s business activities, the company is utilizing the benefits of IoT to improve daily operations within its buildings, manufacturing and, in particular, its data centers. “IBM is a heavy user of IoT in our buildings, manufacturing and in particular in our data centers, to optimize HVAC loads and building performance,” Williams adds.
The benefits of IoT also stretch beyond advanced economies and, perhaps, create a greater impact. In Africa, the IoT is enabling customers to leapfrog over the conventional electricity grid and go straight to “mobile power” — in a similar way that they have already leapfrogged over conventional telecommunications grids to mobile communications.

At the forefront, Jesse Moore, CEO at M-KOPA Solar, is using IoT for solar system metering and performance management, and his company has connected solar power to more than 300,000 homes in East Africa.
“What’s exciting and perhaps unexpected is the fact that IoT is enabling low-income, off-grid customers to leapfrog straight to solar power,” says Moore.
Moore continues to highlight how the multidimensional nature of IoT is also providing ways to improve customer service.
“Data coming back from our solar systems tells us when a customer’s rooftop panel is in the shade, so we can advise them to move it to a better location. To be able to remotely support customers in remote and rural parts of East Africa is a magical thing!” he says, regarding the additional benefits of IoT.

Tesla has yet to unveil the Model 3, but the company just confirmed that it will be available starting at $35,000. The Model 3 has long been rumored to cost about this price, and today, Bloomberg is quoting a Tesla spokesperson who confirmed the starting price.
At that price, the car will retail at a price point slightly higher than the average car sells for in the U.S. It will retail for $2,500 under the starting price of the Chevy Bolt, which is set to debut in late 2016 for $37,500.

But Tesla doesn’t expect buyers to pay full price. The U.S. government is offering a $7,500 tax credit, and some states offer $2,500 or $6,000 rebates. When the minimum incentive is included, both the Chevy Bolt and Tesla Model 3 will retail for under $30,000 — a key price point in the U.S. market.
Both Tesla and GM are counting on these government incentives to help sell their upcoming EVs. GM even includes the minimum government incentive in the Bolt’s price on the car’s product page. Without these rebates, the price of these so-called affordable EVs are not that affordable.
There’s still a big question looming over the Model 3’s pricing: options. Tesla likes to tout the Model S is available for $55,000 (minus rebates, of course), but that’s the most basic model with the shortest range.
When a bigger battery and all-wheel drive is added, the cost of the Model S leaps to $81,200 including rebates. It’s unclear what the $35,000 Model 3 options will look like.

Former Jolla co-founder Marc Dillon has a new job in hardware: Finnish startup Asmo, which has been crowdfunding a mobile charger that switches off automatically when the device is fully charged, has today named Dillon as its new CEO.
The Asmo charger, which aims to reduce electricity wastage and bolster safety with an automatic fix for the problem of mobile chargers being routinely left plugged in, launched as a crowdfunder last summer. It went on to raise more than $90,000 via the Indiegogo platform — funding that’s since been tripled by founder funding, private investment and government entrepreneurial funds to put towards R&D.
The original scheduled shipping deadline of October 2015 for Asmo has slipped by several months. It’s now saying it’s “finalizing the manufacturing” and will announce a delivery date “soon”. Prior to hiring Dillon, founder Asmo Saloranta notes he was working on the project alone — hence bringing in some seasoned mobile hardware expertise at this juncture.
“Now we have the team to deliver to our backers and customers,” says Saloranta in a statement.
Since leaving Jolla last fall, Dillon has worked with another crowdfunding campaign — although the Unseen Art project, which was aiming to make famous artworks accessible to blind and partially sighted people as tactile 3D objects that could be downloaded as 3D files and printed via a 3D printer, failed to achieve its $50,000 funding target.
His prior crowdfunder, the Jolla Tablet, did smash its funding goal but shipment of the slate has been long delayed and it has since hit the rocks in another sense: Jolla this week confirmed it is killing the tablet.
Only around 540 units will now ship to backers, starting from this month, with the rest due to get refunds — although the refund process may take up to a year. Dillon had left Jolla prior to the company announcing the funding difficulties that ultimately led to the tablet being derailed.

VCs have avoided solar deals ever since Solyndra became a four-letter word. But while their attention has strayed, the industry has been on a tear. In 2010, U.S. solar installers hit a milestone of 1 GW per year. Five years later, they’re installing more than 1 GW per month.
This tremendous growth has fed a swelling herd of solar unicorns populated by the likes of SolarCity, SunEdison, SunPower and more.
Recently, the industry has been buffeted by a variety of tailwinds that should drive even faster expansion. The landmark Paris climate accord promises stronger regulatory support across the world. Concurrently, a group of billionaires led by Bill Gates announced the Breakthrough Energy Coalition to fund this roll out.
And the U.S. Congress has extended the solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC), which has raised installation forecasts through 2020 by more than 50 percent. Add to this mix innovation in large-scale battery manufacturing and the future of distributed power generation looks bright indeed.
It’s also creating an opportunity to build the first SaaS unicorn focused on distributed generation. As this industry grows, so does the need for software to improve efficiency and lower costs. “Soft costs,” like permitting, financing and customer acquisition, now represent roughly two-thirds of installed costs of residential deployments. As I’ve written about before, the best way to address such soft costs is with software.
As an example, the manner in which solar developers identify, track and quote potential customers today is decades behind other industries. The leading solar players today use a “spit and glue” combination of Salesforce, homegrown code and Excel. It’s not shocking, therefore, that SolarCity’s customer acquisition costs have actually increased year over year, while installation costs have plummeted.
Getting a firm grasp on total potential market size is much more of an art than a science.
Other industries have solved this problem with software tailored to the specific needs of industry users. In the pharmaceutical space, Veeva Systems (an Emergence portfolio company) built a customer relationship management (CRM) solution focused exclusively on solving customer acquisition problems in pharma. This vertical-specific solution improved sales productivity by an average of 66 percent.
A similar tool for solar could marry building data with customer demographic information to make developers substantially more effective at closing deals. Solar needs a Veeva-like tool to accelerate the path to grid parity (the point at which solar electricity costs the same as average grid electricity and growth skyrockets).
The good news is that a lot of folks are working to build this type of industry cloud application. The Department of Energy’s SunShot Catalyst program is funding a slew of early stage solar software companies. Powerhouse, a solar-focused accelerator, is incubating still more. And even the VCs have started to put money back into the sector, including Obvious Ventures’ recent $3.5 million funding of Sighten.
This momentum has resulted in an exciting emerging ecosystem of SaaS providers focused on the distributed generation (DG) opportunity created by the rise of solar and energy storage. I’ve taken a stab at illustrating it below. I’m sure I’ve left folks off, and others will become miscategorized over time, so feel free to ping me with hate (or love?) email.
Distributed generation software landscape
This is a great start, but it’s still very early innings. Most of these companies are addressing important problems, but doing so as point solutions. To scale, they’ll need to expand beyond these entry points.
Here’s my stab at a recipe for how to build the first solar/DG software unicorn.
Focus on the top line: Start by solving a revenue problem (lead generation, CRM, proposal generation, etc.) versus a cost problem (error reduction, headcount reduction, etc.). It’s typically easier to get in the door with top-line-focused solutions, which is particularly important in industries that are relatively new to significant software spend. Sell by showing a clear return on investment (ROI) of increased sales relative to software spend.
Build sticky, scalable software: Ensure you are used every day. Get to a point where an important employee group literally can’t do their job without your software. Further, it’s critically important to make sure this is true recurring software revenue and not professional services. I can’t emphasize this point enough. Do not become a software consulting firm doing custom builds. Write flexible software that customers can configure themselves.
Layer the cake: Become a suite (expand products). Once you’re sticky in your core product and have become your customers’ most trusted technology provider, expand to solve other pain points. Veeva (the pharma-focused CRM I mentioned earlier) did this and built a nearly $4 billion company in the process.
Expand to the incumbents: To capture the largest possible market size, it will be important to sell not just to today’s distributed generation players but to service the much larger utilities and independent power producers (IPPs) moving into the space — and which desperately need help selling to customers. Remember, these are the folks that have traditionally viewed their customers as “rate payers.”
Expand modalities: Aim to be the software platform for each component of the distributed generation ecosystem (not just solar). Elon’s Gigafactory will only accelerate the coming of distributed storage, which will also require smart software to be sold and integrated effectively.
To clear the mythical $1 billion valuation hurdle, today’s DG software players will need to expand their addressable market. The good news is that the overall solar industry is growing at a rapid clip, so the underlying trends are favorable. Getting a firm grasp on total potential market size is much more of an art than a science, but we can take the International Renewable Energy Agency’s (IRENA) global renewable energy employment forecasts as a basis for estimation.

I’ve roughly assumed 15 percent of IRENA’s global employment forecast will be distributed generation professionals in roles like sales, finance and diligence. I’ve also assumed these professionals would buy SaaS software at $100/seat/month. This rough math gets us to an addressable market today of roughly $1 billion, scaling to $2.25 billion by 2020 and more than $3.5 billion by 2030.
This would be a very exciting future for today’s incipient DG SaaS market. But I see a critical element missing from most of the current players, which will prevent this scale: enterprise SaaS talent. Most DG software executives today have tremendous experience in renewable energy, but they haven’t built and scaled large subscription-based software companies. Getting this talent in the door and pairing it with the solar pros is the only way I see companies scaling the mountain.

Unfortunately, there’s not a lot of cross-pollination going on today. Solar folks tend to hang with solar folks and SaaS folks with SaaS folks, like they’re on different planets. We have to find a way to bridge these worlds to birth a unicorn.

351,It’s Your Fault If The Paris Climate Agreement Fails,https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/20/its-your-fault-if-the-paris-climate-agreement-fails/,2016/01/20,"

In Paris, world leaders debated how much global CO2 emissions could be reduced, who would pay for it and how could they trust each other to follow through.
This top-down, regulatory approach to addressing a highly distributed problem is a necessary but insufficient step to make a dent in rising global temperatures. In a recent peer-reviewed research paper, Bjorn Lomborg of the Copenhagen Consensus Center suggests all the carbon-cutting promises countries committed to ahead of Paris would cut global temperatures by just 0.05°C (0.09°F) by 2100.
Policies and international treaties are important to address climate change, and they push the conversation forward in the right direction. Unfortunately, they often lack the teeth to hold countries accountable and enforce adherence to the lofty goals they set forth.
While the Paris Climate Agreement is historic and gives reason to celebrate, without follow-through by the collective populations of those countries, any goal is unattainable. Top-down policy can be swayed and derailed by a presidential election, as we’ve seen in Australia and the U.K. in recent years. But a groundswell of individual and community action has the momentum to persist.


Climate change rests on our shoulders
This is why each one of us is personally responsible for the outcome of these talks. We all laud the efforts and strides made over the course of the agreement, but measurable action ultimately falls upon the shoulders of citizens who demand and manifest it within their own lives.
As the zeitgeist clearly shifts its focus to climate change, it follows a similar arc to the anti-smoking movement of previous decades in the U.S. Scientific research and government regulation only advanced the anti-smoking agenda so far, but this harmful habit only truly began to decline when individuals, communities and businesses enacted changes to quit smoking, prohibit smoking in public places, increase the product costs and reduce the visibility of its advertising.
A social stigma developed as we recognized that smoking was no longer simply a personal choice, but a clear danger to the public good in the form of reduced life expectancy, increased healthcare costs, secondhand smoke and childhood vulnerability.
The power to follow through on the Paris climate talks rests more in our hands than we realize.
“Dirty energy” must similarly become a social stigma if we are going to truly limit the effects of climate change. For us to successfully address such an existential challenge, every person needs to take pause and give a second thought before using energy from unsustainable sources. Every person must be given a choice to either use dirty energy or choose to avoid it.
Smarter energy
The most immediate challenges to this notion are visibility and personal empowerment. Most people are not aware of the tools at their disposal to understand when and why they’re using dirty and unsustainable energy. With the proliferation of smart meters taking place across the U.S. this past decade, the data is floating out there in the aether waiting to be put to use. Many companies dedicate their efforts to unearth and package this data in consumer-friendly formats.
Residents can install ultra-efficient lighting, such as the Philips Hue, use energy-monitoring devices, such as Chai or Rainforest, replace their appliances with new low-consumption versions and even install large capacity battery arrays to soak up excess power from solar, the most visible and commonly recognized clean technology.
A less familiar and unfortunate side effect of solar is that it is “intermittent.” This is energy-speak that means occasionally, a cloud might drift overhead and we experience a shortfall in the energy we expected to have on hand. To make up for these unexpected shortfalls, the grid currently uses “peaker plants.”
These are inefficient and incredibly damaging power plants used to meet peak demand temporarily, and spew far more local particulate pollution and greenhouse gases than baseload power plants do. When there is a shortfall in electricity, they are currently the only viable and widespread method for managing the intermittency of renewable energy, which we so desperately need to proliferate.
What we need is a solution that every home can use. One that empowers every person to choose whether they use “dirty energy” and one with a clear cause-effect relationship to climate change.
Every person must be given a choice to either use dirty energy or choose to avoid it.
What if, when we experienced a shortfall in energy supply, whether caused by clouds, a windless day or a surge in demand, every person knew that these most damaging power plants were going to turn on? We could choose whether or not to collectively reduce our energy use to prevent the damage done by those power plants. Every person in that community would be empowered to say “no” as quickly as responding to a text message, and their community’s dirtiest energy polluters would be taken offline.
Organizing people to use less energy from these dirty “peaker plants” is not something that comes from Paris policymakers. It comes from individual action; actions that say “no” to dirty power and “yes” to further building our solar, wind and renewable infrastructure. That’s a compelling proposition.
Smart energy proliferates in smart states
There is continually growing awareness and pent-up demand for people to take individual action on climate change. Here in California we know firsthand that residents seize the opportunity to participate in a community reduction when it’s using energy from dirty power plants — an energy “sit-in” if you will. Once all of California participates in such micro-reductions, we can reduce California’s greenhouse gas footprint by one billion pounds per year.
Beyond the California state line, there’s massive opportunity for other states to take on what currently sets California and a few other states apart: innovative energy frameworks that empower and even incentivize individuals to participate in these small reductions that add up to big impact.
Other states, like Texas and the energy market known as the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) Interconnection, are also moving in this direction, which enable innovative companies to transform inefficient grids into smart energy platforms that make dirty energy obsolete.
The power to follow through on the Paris climate talks rests more in our hands than we realize. We can use technology, our collective action and the power of the Internet to hack climate change. All it takes is the will to do so.

In Saudi Arabia, a country known more for its vast oil reserves than its commitment to renewable energy, a small startup called NOMADD Desert Solar Solutions has developed a new way to clean up the process of solar energy production — literally.
Even the Saudi kingdom realizes that despite the attractively low prices of fossil fuels, solar energy is gaining momentum.
Solar panels are therefore going to play an increasingly important role in the global energy market this year.
But one challenge that some countries face is the dust build-up forming on desert-based panels, which considerably decreases the amount of energy being produced (there can be up to 60% energy yield losses during and after sand storms.)
NOMADD is a Saudi-based startup that has developed a viable solution to this problem: The NO-water Mechanical Automated Dusting Device, a smart and ecological desert solar panel cleaning system.
The NOMADD is a long tube (3-5 meters) built in a sleek and simple design that brushes away the panel dust. It can handle large misalignments or settling in the arrays and doesn’t rest any weight on the panels as it runs on rails. The secret, as with painting, is in the angle of the brush.

It’s a viable alternative to the existing solution — hiring janitors with water hoses. Labor looks cheap, given the size of a large scale solar installation and add all the costs associated with cleaning the panels (time, water, etc.) expenses mount up. NOMADD is waterless and fully automatic, making the whole process much less expensive.
“You basically push a button on your smartphone and your whole array is clean within half an hour,” explains Georg Eitelhuber, the co-founder and chief technology officer “The array is 99.5% as clean as if you were cleaning with water.”
Eitelhuber is an Australian Mechanical Engineer who moved to Saudi Arabia in 2009, where he became a Physics high school teacher at KAUST (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology). He simultaneously completed a Masters in Renewable Energy and began collaborating with Energy Oasis, a campus-based testing area for companies to try out their new technologies.
Noticing that there were no effective solutions to cleaning desert-based solar panels, Eitelhuber saw an opportunity to solve a big problem in the industry.
“I believed then, and I still believe now, that solar is going to be huge in the Middle East,” says Eitelhuber.
After collecting data, he began building prototypes out of LEGO for about 18 months, involving his students in the project. Once the model was completed in 2012, Eitelhuber took it to the Tech Transfer office of KAUST, got it patented and eventually received seed funding in the amount of $200,000.
This financial boost allowed Eitelhuber to get a technician on board, start carrying out deeper tests and build a bigger model. With the backing of the Solar Research Center at KAUST, the team worked on making the product simpler and lighter, integrating it into different solar panels. NOMADD has been commercialized but is still in beta mode.
They have sold a couple of models and are fostering strong partnerships with Engineering Procurement Construction Firms (EPCs), who are the main distributors in this sector.
Basically, government entities put out tenders for projects and it’s up to the EPCs to place bids. They decide what panels they’re going to use, define the understructure, the operations and maintenance, etc. They then put together a package and stick that package in for tender.
“What we’re offering them is a way to value add their proposals by integrating us in the design stage and offering us as part of their bid,” explains Eitelhuber.
NOMADD has entered a booming market. The Saudi oil Minister announced in 2014 the launch of a $100 billion solar program for Saudi Arabia. Other markets like the UAE, Jordan, Egypt and India are also hot for solar energy.
“The biggest challenge for us, [is] we’re selling a solution to a problem that most people don’t know about”, explains Eitelhuber.
The startup has just signed a term sheet for a $1 million Series A funding round. “This is what we need to get this project commercialized,” says Eitelhuber.

As compliance pressure mounts, businesses turn to regulatory technology
What regulation crowdfunding in the JOBS Act means to entrepreneurs and startups




Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates first teamed up in 2010 for a Wired cover that revisited the 25th anniversary of Steven Levy’s Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution.
During the interview, Gates states that there are new and more opportunities for the hacker spirit to live on. “They need the same type of crazy fanaticism of youthful genius and naèfvetè that drove the PC industry — and can have the same impact on the human condition.”
Since that cover story, Zuckerberg and Gates have taken that hacker spirit and applied to becoming two of the most generous and well-known philanthropists in the world.
Zuckerberg has donated $100 million to schools in Newark, NJ; an undisclosed amount to the open-source project Diaspora; was one of the individuals involved with creating the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences; and, through the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, gives millions of dollars to healthcare, such as $75 million to San Francisco General Hospital.
As for Gates, he has long since left Microsoft to spend his time spearheading the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. He’s already donated more than $28 billion of his own fortune on initiatives that focus on preventing and treating diseases like malaria; introducing technology that can assist farmers in developing countries grow sustainable crops; and supporting educational programs in the U.S. that can tap into the potential of students.
Most notably, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg are two members of the “Giving Pledge” – a project launched by Gates and Warren Buffet where billionaires would donate at least half of their wealth. Approximately 138 billionaires – which includes Larry Ellison, Elon Musk, Ted Turner, and Michael Bloomberg – have signed the pledge. Zuckerberg, an original signer, has recently upped the ante by announcing that he would away 99% of his Facebook stock, worth $45 billion, to the pledge.
But, Zuckerberg and Gates are once again teaming up in one of the most ambitious projects during their philanthropic careers.
Announcing the Breakthrough Energy Coalition
The timing was appropriate for the announcement of the Breakthrough Energy Coalition. It occurred on the eve of the COP21 climate change conference in Paris. In a Facebook post announcing the coalition, with his wife Priscilla and Gates, Zuckerberg stated:
“Solving the clean energy problem is an essential part of building a better world. We won’t be able to make meaningful progress on other challenges — like educating or connecting the world — without secure energy and a stable climate. Yet progress towards a sustainable energy system is too slow, and the current system doesn’t encourage the kind of innovation that will get us there faster.”
He also added that “The Breakthrough Energy Coalition will invest in ideas that have the potential to transform the way we all produce and consume energy.”
Paralleling the announcement of the coalition, Gates joined the leaders of 20 nations for Mission Innovation, which according to its website, “aims to reinvigorate and accelerate global clean energy innovation with the objective to make clean energy widely affordable.”
The participating countries plans to increase annual spending on research and to $20 billion. On the private sector, Gates and Zuckerberg are among 28 wealthy investors, which also includes Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, and Jack Ma, “will provide capital for early, high-risk research on the most promising technologies.”

What Does This Mean For Clean Energy In 2016?
The biggest question that we should be asking is whether or not is how the Breakthrough Energy Coalition is going to affect the future of clean energy.
Fulfilling A Need For Clean Energy
The Paris-based International Energy Agency conducted a study which found “that despite a few recent success stories, clean-energy progress is falling well short of the levels needed to limit the global increase in temperatures to no more than 2 degrees C.” Furthermore, the IEA claimed that “it will be challenging for the world to meet its climate goals solely through the UN negotiation process that is expected to yield an agreement this December in Paris.” Because of this, the IEA suggests that there is an urgent need to develop and deploy “groundbreaking technologies” to combat the changes in climate.
Both Gates and Zuckerberg have been aware of this as well.
In a blog post from July 2015, Gates announced that he had planned to “invest $1 billion in clean energy technology over the next five years.” As for Zuckerberg, he notes that Facebook has already been investing in renewable and clean energy at the company’s facilities.
The Breakthrough Energy Coalition is continuing to address the need for clean energy by bringing together both the private and public sectors, which have a bigger impact than the measures already taken by Gates and Zuckerberg.
Given the recent ‘historic’ deal announced at COP21, with a total of 195 countries  agreeing to limit global warming to below 2C by the end of the century, it makes sense to strike while the iron is hot and continue to push for active participation in research and development for clean energy solutions.
As UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said, “The time has come to acknowledge that national interests are best served by acting in the international interest. We have to do as science dictates. We must protect the planet that sustains us. We need all our hands on deck.”
The Coalition Will Attract Investors
Just like the “Giving Pledge,” the Breakthrough Energy Coalition will be able to attract the world’s wealthiest entrepreneurs and investors. While part of that may be due to competition or being socially conscious, the fact is that the coalition is making clean energy a profitable opportunity for the private sector.
As mentioned on its website, “These investors will certainly be motivated partly by the possibility of making big returns over the long-term.”
Gates and Zuckerberg both realize that investing in clean energy is good for business. As Gates states in his July blog post, “of all the people who will be affected by climate change, those in poor countries will suffer the most.” He adds, “affordable clean energy will help fight poverty.”
In his recent trip to India, Zuckerberg stressed the importance of connecting everyone in India online. The reason? India could become Facebook’s largest market. By giving providing widespread internet access in India, new business opportunities, such as in the energy sector, could bring billions of people out of poverty.
The Microsoft and Facebook founders know that clean energy is important for business. If clean energy has the power to introduce new job opportunities and decrease poverty, then why wouldn’t investors follow the lead. Amazon, Virgin, and Alibaba also seem to realize this, which is why they’re already a part of the BEC.
As Ernest Moniz, the U.S. Secretary of Energy, believes, “New energy supply, demand and infrastructure technologies will generate expenditures at the trillion-dollar scale. Benefits will surely accrue to the early innovators.”
The Coalition Will Bring Together The Private And Public Sectors For R&D
Moniz also notes that both the public and private sectors have realized the importance of research and development in clean energy. And, that’s exactly where the BEC is aiming to do.
On its website, the BEC states, that the “current governmental funding levels for clean energy are simply insufficient to meet the challenges before us.” The site goes on to say;
“We must also add the skills and resources of leading investors with experience in driving innovation from the lab to the marketplace. The private sector knows how to build companies, evaluate the potential for success, and take the risks that lead to taking innovative ideas and bringing them to the world.”
Research and development has been effective. Joe Romm, in an article for ThinkProgress, proudly exclaims that since the mid-90s “the clean energy R&D push succeeded beyond most people’s wildest dreams — a more than 99 percent drop in solar PV costs since 1999 and a 95 percent drop since the late 1990s!”
Romm goes on to say of the BEC that “while a boost in cleantech R&D funding is always welcome, what is most needed now is money for accelerated deployment and project financing of technologies that are now market-ready.”
Whether that is the case or not currently, bringing together the private and public sectors could lead to funding for clean energy technologies that are market ready.
Other efforts also illustrate the shift in terms of the business world and investor community taking on a larger role in addressing clean tech solutions versus previously leaving it in the hands of scientists and government. For example, it’s exciting and inspiring to see annual competitions like the recent Clean Tech Open, which is the largest accelerator of early-stage clean-technology companies. Recently, it announced the winners of the National Accelerator, Global Ideas competition, and Global Cleantech Innovation Program (GCIP), all of which are geared at encouraging the R&D effort while supporting entrepreneurs to focus on launching cleantech startups. To date, Cleantech Open has helped companies to raise more than $1.2 billion in external funding over the past decade.
It definitely helps to have people like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg leading the charge, but we need to be aware that everyone can make a difference in winning the war on climate change. Whether it is 195 countries reaching an agreement, more competitions and investors funding clean tech startups, or Goldman Sachs and other investment firms backing low-emissions stocks, the point here is that united action is being taken and will need to continue until we reach our emissions goals.

Investors, Entrepreneurs Upbeat On Energy Storage, China And The Internet Of Things




Back in January 2014, the CBC aired “The Cleantech Crash,” which highlighted the difficulty of operating in cleantech in the past few years. The documentary revealed how much the mood had changed since John Doerr’s now-famous March 8, 2007, TED talk on climate change and renewable energy.
Following the talk, and caught up in the hype, Washington and Silicon Valley poured into cleantech more than $100 billion — but instead of breakthroughs, the industry suffered setbacks, with investors now scaling back financial support.
Venture capitalist Rob Day, earlier last year, pointed out how the cleantech industry got overhyped and VCs are now more cautious in investing in technologies, which may or may not, generate attractive returns.
Fast forward to Paris, where governments from nearly 200 countries recently came together to agree for the first time on a universal agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions and create a legally binding process for reviewing national emissions targets every five years.
The strong consensus from COP21, which also included Bill Gates’ announcement of the Breakthrough Energy Coalition, was positively received by clean energy investors and venture capitalists. The International Investors Group on Climate Change, a network managing €13 trillion in assets, said the decision would help trigger a shift away from fossil fuels and encourage greater investments in renewable energy.
So with the cleantech crash, and now, the Paris Climate Change Deal, the question remains: Are we going to see a cleantech revival? Or will the Paris summit result in an another bubble? When asked, well-known investors are confident that cleantech will deliver in the near future.
Venture capitalist Nancy Pfund, the founder of DBL Partners (who has supported some of the most successful modern clean energy companies, including Tesla, SolarCity, PowerLight, BrightSource and NexTracker), seems confident that the sector will see a turnaround following COP21, and investors will again support cleantech entrepreneurs.
“You are seeing renewed interest from venture capitalists, corporate investors and foundations in recognizing that we have a significant problem to solve. Where there are big problems to solve, there is opportunity for successful investment,” says Pfund.
On the prospects of cleantech in the coming years, Pfund goes onto add that, “We have a very informed group of people keen to invest in cleantech; and we also have many high-quality entrepreneurs coming into the sector.”
Clean energy investor Jonathan Silver, also agreed that the Paris Climate Change Deal was a step forward and should encourage cleantech investment.
“The world community is coming together in support of a clean economy and this should encourage further investment,” says Silver. “I suspect we will see a number of new sector-specific funds raised soon” he says.
Silver is the managing partner at Tax Equity Advisors, which invests in clean energy projects and the CEO of Greenbanc Global, a clean energy investment/consulting firm. He previously headed federal government’s $50 billion clean energy investment fund and has been named one of the country’s top 10, greentech “influencers.”
Paul Straub, Partner at Claremont Creek Ventures, adds that the outcome from Paris is unlikely to play directly into specific investment decisions, but, instead, provide a degree of stability regarding the regulatory and policy environment from various levels of government.
“From COP21, I expect policy and regulatory decisions that are created to provide a more certain environment which can allow entrepreneurs to operate,” says Straub.
Government support for cleantech remains important
Historically, the U.S. government has played an important role in supporting energy transitions within the economy. Following COP21, in an Op-Ed, World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim highlighted the need for a clean energy transformation and an ambitious global transition toward renewable energy.
Much of President Kim’s vision will depend on government policies to support this transition. Andrew Beebe, Managing Director at Obvious Ventures, agreed that policy and regulatory decisions will play an important part in meeting COP21’s commitments. He suggests that carbon pricing is the most effective way to support the transition, and federal programs have an important role to play.
“A carbon tax or a real cap-and-trade program at the national level is going to be the most cost-effective method for us to make this transition,” says Beebe. “Federal programs like the ITC, PTC and DoE SunShot are excellent catalysts for different forms of growth and will help people focus on the right solutions for the long term.”
In June 2015, the International Energy Agency (IEA) also echoed the need to implement strong domestic policies, such as carbon pricing, to meet COP21’s commitments. The IEA went on further to suggest that governments should gradually phase out of fossil-fuel subsidies to end users by 2030, and increase investment in renewable energy technologies.
The Breakthrough Energy Coalition initiative will play an impactful role
Bill Gates’ announcement of the Breakthrough Energy Coalition came prior to the agreement in Paris. The public-private partnership between governments, investors and academia will likely have a significant impact, because the synergy of each party will be able to provide value-added input in scaling cleantech products, from research to deployment.
The coalition, which aims to provide money for research, startups and deployment, has talked about a “dramatically scaled-up public research pipeline” and will provide “seed, angel and Series A investments” in order to support the deployment of technologies developed at scale.
Therefore, with such a global consensus on climate change, and a collaborative push to scale cleantech products, I think the Paris Climate Change Deal will prove to be the much needed catalyst in reviving cleantech.

Faraday says it sees this vehicle as more of a “car of concepts” than just a singular concept car. Along with the FFZERO1, the company revealed a variable platform architecture (VPA) — the concept being that they build the base platform of the car once, and then adapt it for different form factors of cars. In theory, the base used in that 1,000 horsepower concept car pictured above could be lifted a bit and turned into something resembling an SUV.
The FFZERO1 lists with some pretty odd features. The seating is said to be made for zero gravity situations (for some reason), and the car will channel oxygen and water through a helmet Faraday is developing. You can stick your iPhone right on the steering wheel for navigation and other data, and the car will act as a “digital copilot” by projecting augmented reality visuals on the road ahead.
Faraday’s head of global design Richard Kim called the car something “not of this world”, noting the strange “UFO line” design that divides the black and silver body of the vehicle; according to Kim, this “UFO line” will be signature to all of Faraday Future’s cars.
The TechCrunch team actually got an accidental sneak preview of the car after arriving a bit too early for the show tonight. Lacking any signage or people to tell us to “go away” we walked right in and saw it with our own eyes before everyone else. Alas, they realized we weren’t supposed to be there before we could snap off a pic — but as you’ve now seen, it looked the same as the leaked images from earlier.



Along with the modular car, Faraday revealed it would be building a car manufacturing plant in Northern Las Vegas in the next few weeks and that it has formed an alliance with Chinese electronics company LeTV.
LeTV invests in many electronics companies and plans to unveil its own car concept this year, however it looks like it is in more than just an alliance with FF. You may recall an earlier TechCrunch report revealed just how much LeTV backs Faraday, even buying the building it currently works out of in Gardena California.

357,Images Of Faraday Future’s Crazy Concept Car Seemingly Leak Via Its App,https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/04/images-of-faraday-futures-crazy-concept-car-seemingly-leak-via-its-app/,2016/01/04,"
Whoops. Faraday Future — the super mysterious electric car company that no one really seems to know much about — is all set to debut something tonight… and it seems that something might’ve just leaked.
An app called “Faraday Future Concept” briefly hit the app store this morning, complete with concept images and slides describing a “1000 horsepower” vehicle.
Though the app has been pulled, Twitter user Superannuation grabbed a bunch of screenshots of it before it was taken down. AppShopper has the app store listing cached here. Here’s what it looked like:

And here’s a video, shot by the same person as the above screenshots:

At least according to the text from within the app, Faraday is shooting for a vehicle that hits 0-60 in under three seconds — right in that super car sweet spot that Tesla has thus far owned in the electric car space.
Is this what Faraday Future will show tonight? Perhaps. Of course, that doesn’t necessarily mean this is what the car will look like whenever it eventually hits the road. It’s a concept, after all.
And yeah, it kind of looks like this Hot Wheels car.

358,An Investment Opportunity In Trash,https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/20/a-future-investment-opportunity-trash/,2015/12/20,"




S. H. Jucha
Contributor


S.H. Jucha was a senior manager in the technical education and software development industries, with degrees in Biology and Broadcast Communications. He is the author of the science fiction series, The Silver Ships.


As incredible as it might seem, processing trash may represent a future unique investment opportunity. Consider the new technologies that will operate on the micro scale, breaking the bonds of molecules through bio-mechanical means, which could be applied to recycling trash completely. It is quite possible that many of these innovations may emerge from our efforts to explore and live in space.
Since the dawn of the Industrial Age, we have polluted our streams, rivers, lakes and oceans with pesticide and fertilizer runoff, mining and oil wastes, petrochemical products and thousands of other dangerous products.
Pollution has reached the point where a cleanup of our environment — on a macro scale with heavy equipment — is impractical. Despite present efforts, humanity is losing the fight to manage trash.
Commercial and government-mandated recycling can’t cope with the sheer volume of trash, and these programs only excel at processing such material as paper, aluminum and steel. In essence, the present forms of trash collection and recycling are unacceptable.
The opportunity for investment in effective trash processing will be huge. We have discarded billions of tons of plastic across our planet in the last 60 years. So much debris has accumulated in the Pacific Ocean that it has been termed the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Scientists believe that the trash has been sinking beneath the surface, making accurate measurement of the amount of trash difficult.
Plastics, whose durability, inexpensiveness and malleability make it an easy choice for consumer and industrial products, make up the majority of the garbage patch debris. In a process called photo degradation, which is caused by the ultra violet (UV) component of solar radiation (that is, radiation of wavelength from 0.295 to 0.400 um), the plastics have been broken down into smaller and smaller pieces. National Geographic states that scientists have collected up to 750,000 bits of micro-plastic in a single square kilometer of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch — that’s about 1.9 million bits per square mile.
Now comes the age of our expansion into space, requiring that we conquer new and unique problems. Obstacles that were overcome in early space exploration have already made invaluable contributions to today’s technologies and helped tackle problems we have faced planetside.
Importantly, space exploration will not be a future of just probes launched to investigate asteroids and distant bodies — which I applaud — but, more importantly, the creation of long-term habitats, both government and commercial missions, which Buzz Aldrin appropriately calls “permanence.”
With the daunting challenges facing countries today — dwindling precious resources, effects of climate change, outbreaks of deadly diseases, long-term conflicts and mass human migration — 100 percent recycling/reclamation projects can’t be high on their lists of priorities.
However, long-term space exploration will have the priorities of food, water, oxygen, fuels, environment control, protection from solar radiation and a growing pile of expended materials … trash.
Ensuring humans live in an invigorating environment would not only be good economics, it would be the right thing to do.
Long-term habitation will demand extremely efficient resource management of water, air, organics and inorganics … those items that typically, when worn out, enter our trash piles and consist of everything from door seals to expended lubricants. Our scientists will have to approach the challenge of recycling with an eye toward 100 percent solutions, and recycling inorganics will present the greatest challenge.
Simply put, trash will cost too much to ship back to Earth, and it would be invaluable if this waste could be fully recycled into environmentally useful components. With Earth’s resources dwindling, the better we can recycle and reclaim what today we call “trash” and repurpose it in our commercial products, the more we can extend the lifespan of Earth’s resources.
Petrochemical products — from synthetic rubber and solvents to fibers and plastics — may be degraded by various micro-organisms, which break the carbon bonds to produce byproducts such as methane, carbon dioxide and water.
Space habitats represent an ideal environment to experiment with closed systems employing bio-engineered micro-organisms to recycle petrochemical products, where, in case of accidental release of the organisms, it might be opportune to open the test area to vacuum.
Why experiment with bio-engineered micro-organisms? Why not? There are plenty of examples that give credence to the concept:

Forty years ago, Shinichi Kinoshita, Sadao Kageyama, Kazuhiko Iba, Yasuhiro Yamada and Hirosuke Okada discovered a strain of Flavobacterium that digested certain byproducts from the manufacture of nylon-6, a form of nylon fiber that is tough and possesses high-tensile strength, as well as elasticity. The fibers are wrinkle-proof and highly resistant to abrasion and chemicals such as acids and alkalis. The fact that bacterium began using as energy sources these substances that didn’t exist before 1935 is a telling point. Microorganisms, with their prodigious reproduction rate, can quickly evolve to adapt to ever-changing environments.
A trip to the Amazon’s Yasuni National Park by Yale University students and molecular biochemistry professor Scott Strobel resulted in the discovery of endophytic fungi (mushrooms) capable of eating polyurethane plastics. A synthetic polymer, polyurethane is the basis of most of today’s plastics.
Methanogenic consortia, a diverse group of widely distributed archaebacteria that occur in anaerobic environments and are capable of producing methane from a limited number of substrates, including carbon dioxide, hydrogen, acetate and methylamines, have been found to degrade styrene, using it as a carbon source, and various fungi have broken down plasticized PVC.
An example of petrochemical degradation includes a rod-shaped bacterium, Alcanivorax borkumensis, found throughout the oceans. The bacteria consume alkanes, a form of hydrocarbon, as their primary form of energy, breaking down hydrocarbons into carbon dioxide and water. These ancient bacteria, resident since the planet began seeping hydrocarbons from the ocean bottoms, bloomed in heavy quantities after the Deep Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and contributed to the removal of hydrocarbons from the Gulf’s waters.
The attack of microorganisms on petrochemicals has been continual since the advent of each product. Even space station Mir was found to have been growing more than 70 species of bacteria, mold and fungi in free condensate, floating water globules, hiding behind such areas as the station’s electrical panels — and mold is capable of degrading rubber into digestible compounds.

Future space habitats, with their complete isolation, present an excellent opportunity for micro-scale waste management experiments that would involve genetically modified microorganisms. Unfortunately, these types of experiments will not be a priority in the early stages of habitats. Supplies will be too precious to be consumed in “nice-to-have” experiments.
However, when habitats graduate to the size of colonies, housing thousands of residents, “nice-to-have” may become “must-have,” and the pressure to develop efficient processes to recycle inorganics, such as plastics, will only increase as the colonies grow.
Creating and employing genetically engineered bacterium, fungi, yeasts, algae, lichens and the like to recycle petrochemical products — until such time as alternative, easily recyclable materials are developed — will be the responsibility of disciplines such as biochemists, geneticists and engineers — or collectively what I like to call waste management’s bio-alchemists.
Despite present efforts, humanity is losing the fight to manage trash. 
Whatever new technologies long-term space habitats invent to manage inorganic wastes, recycling the material into reusable components, construction products or other practical purposes, it’s my fervent hope that they will translate into a boon for solutions to Earth’s problems. If they do, new techniques in recycling and pollution mitigation will represent a global business opportunity.
A first step on Earth might limit the applications to controlled facilities, processing trash from homes and businesses. Later, with subsequent iterations that limit the microorganisms’ life cycles, the solutions may be applied to Earth’s open waters and landscapes. Glory to the future of garbage management!
As an environmentalist, I do not see these future innovations as “nice to have.” I see them as economic necessities. If we wish to have the luxury of time to investigate our solar system, building habitats on distant planets and moons and involving commercial ventures, we must ensure the health of the global economic base from which the funds and resources will spring to feed our space exploration endeavors.
At present, our global population is estimated to be 7.27 billion people; by the mid-21st century, this number is expected to reach 9.6 billion. Regardless of the extent of our ventures into space, the overwhelming majority of these people will remain on Earth, and they will require a healthy and safe environment if they are to contribute to the global economy. Ensuring humans live in an invigorating environment would not only be good economics, it would be the right thing to do.
Perhaps in the future, commercial products may be created through technologies such as nano-manufacturing. It would eliminate much of the problem of inventing recycling methods or finding places to bury our trash, because these products could be repaired or recycled by reversing the nano-manufacturing process.

359,The Real Reason We Should Be Thinking About Sustainability,https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/13/the-real-reason-we-should-be-thinking-about-sustainability/,2015/12/13,"




Jeff Clarke
Contributor


Jeff Clarke is the vice chairman, operations and president of client solutions of Dell.


“Sustainability” and “innovation” are two broad marketing terms used in conjunction so often that they’ve become almost meaningless. You’ll hear executives talking about how sustainability is good for business and the environment — and that’s why every business, in every industry should be “innovating its sustainable practices” or “creating sustainable innovation.”
When I hear such vague platitudes, I think to myself, what does that even mean? Does the person saying it even know? Probably not.
Right or wrong, I’m a business-minded pragmatist. I don’t think in platitudes. I think about what will drive business outcomes for customers.
Every company should be thinking about sustainability. But not because it’s the right thing to do for the environment — we won’t get anywhere by slapping the word “green” on a product name and telling the world that it’s innovative. What we can do is reimagine products, processes and models with proven sustainable methods to ultimately transform our businesses. Sustainability is a real hidden source of creativity for our business practices — that’s what marketers aren’t saying.
Let me provide a concrete example. Across the technology industry, waste is a widespread problem. As one of the largest electronics companies, Dell is always looking for ways to reduce our waste, increase our bottom line and deliver more value for our customers. So we dug into our processes and came to the conclusion that excess carbon fiber and scrap raw materials are areas where we can save some money and reduce our carbon footprint — ultimately helping our customers do the same.
We decided to partner with supplier SABIC to recycle excess carbon fiber and scrap raw materials into new Dell products beginning in late 2015. Our Latitude and Alienware products will contain recycled carbon fiber, with plans to expand across these two product portfolios in 2016. The recycling will prevent almost a million pounds of carbon fiber from ending up in landfills.
It remains to be seen how significantly this will impact our bottom line, but I’m optimistic. Since we began putting recycled plastics into our products in January 2014, the company has recycled 4.2 million pounds of plastics into enclosures for 34 products, including new flat-panel monitor models and three Dell OptiPlex desktops.
On a macro level, a marketer might say that we’re “advancing the circular economy” with such practices. The way I’d say it, though, is we’re reducing waste and reliance on natural resources for the sake of the economy — with estimates that this shift over time could create $1 trillion in additional value.
“Sustainability” and “innovation” are two broad marketing terms used in conjunction so often that they’ve become almost meaningless. 
Companies need to take more leadership and ownership of their corporate sustainability practices — for the potential economic impact and the sake of increasing profits, not just to have a clean conscience. There are a number of companies doing it right, thinking about sustainability across supply chain and R&D, and even encouraging consumers to be more eco-friendly.
One of those companies is Philips. When governments around the world passed regulations to phase out incandescent bulbs, Philips responded by coming up with a range of bulbs that not only generate less heat and use a fraction of the energy of older types of bulbs, according to The New York Times, but it also led the charge in a new space: mood lighting.
Philips’ goLITE BLU counteracts a person’s drop in energy — or the winter blues — through a panel of blue LEDs. Blue stimulates a photoreceptor in the eye that reduces melatonin production and helps a person stay awake. When a person is ready to go to sleep, the light reduces the amount of blue light emitted.
In Europe, Philips is experimenting with the technology in hospitals through a pilot program called HealWell. By changing colors based on time of day, it encourages a patient to wake up, feel more relaxed and sleep more easily. At a field study at the Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands, cardiology patients were found to sleep longer and experience reduced depression.
Philips has another smart lighting system made specifically for farmers. Tomato and vegetable growers in the Netherlands and Canada are using Philips’ LEDs to improve bulk, increase fruit growth and reduce vegetable maturation time while reducing energy costs.
When Philips was forced to think about sustainability from the start, the company got creative and came up with a product that was cutting-edge. Many startups and large corporations have since followed Philips’ lead and created their own adaptive LED lights, recognizing the business potential for this innovation.
I can’t stress it enough — as companies, we need to be thinking long-term, not just tacking “green-certified” at the end of product names and telling the public that it’s “better.”
To put it in marketing-speak, we should be “innovating sustainable practices” for the sake of creating a better product, not just because “it’s the right thing to do.”

360,Alphabet Gets A “V” By Renaming Google Life Sciences To “Verily”,https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/07/alphabet-gets-a-v-by-renaming-google-life-sciences-to-verily/,2015/12/07,"
As Alphabet continues to rejigger their company structure, one of the teams left under the Alphabet umbrella has gotten itself a new moniker, according to Stat News. Verily is an independent Alphabet company with a focus on using tech to deal with health, as well as prevent, detect and manage disease.
According to the Dictionary, Verily means “in truth; really; indeed” and has Middle English origins. The website that now sits at verily.com asks the simple question: “How can we use technology to create a true picture of human health?”
It also explains the origins of the unit, which was started within Google[x] in 2012:
When Google[x] embarked on a project in 2012 to put computing inside a contact lens — an immensely challenging technical problem with an important application to health — we could not have imagined where it would lead us. As a life sciences team within Google[x], we were able to combine the best of our technology heritage with expertise from across many fields. Now, as an independent company, Verily is focused on using technology to better understand health, as well as prevent, detect, and manage disease.

In case you’ve forgotten, this is the team that’s working on a contact lens that will test your glucose levels, which is amazing for anyone dealing with diabetes.
When reached for comment, a Verily spokesperson told us:
Verily is a new company that is focused on bringing together technology, science and medicine in the places where we think we can have the biggest impact on the detection, management, and prevention of disease. It was formerly known as the life sciences team at Google and is part of Alphabet.

361,Mark Zuckerberg And Bill Gates Join Forces To Invest In Clean Energy Technology,https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/29/breakthrough-energy-coalition/,2015/11/29,"
The founders of Facebook and Microsoft are teaming up to solve climate change. Mark Zuckerberg announced today that he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, have launched the Breakthrough Energy Coalition with Bill Gates to invest in zero-carbon energy technology around the world. The organization’s membership roster includes some of the most prolific names in technology, including Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, Jack Ma, and Masayoshi Son.
The news was timed to coincide with the U.N. Climate Control Conference, which will take place in Paris this week. During the event, Gates and U.S. President Barack Obama are expected to unveil a significant new initiative called Mission Innovation, which will work with governments to double public investments in energy research over the next five years.
According to the Washington Post, the 19 countries that have already joined Mission Innovation will increase their annual spending on clean-energy research and development to $20 billion by 2020.
Mission Innovation and the Breakthrough Energy Coalition are separate programs, but will work closely together in countries that have committed to reducing carbon emissions.
On its website, the Breakthrough Energy Coalition explains that its goal is to cover gaps in government funding in countries by commercializing the most promising and scalable ideas to come out of public research institutions. It will take a flexible attitude toward investments, providing early-stage to Series A funding in several sectors, including electricity generation and storage, transportation, industrial use, agriculture, and energy system efficiency.

362,Jeff Bezos’ Space Program Successfully Lands A Rocket,https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/24/jeff-bezos-space-program-successfully-lands-a-rocket/,2015/11/24,"
Jeff Bezos took to Twitter for the first time to announce a milestone from his space company Blue Origin, and the Internet soaked it in.


The rarest of beasts – a used rocket. Controlled landing not easy, but done right, can look easy. Check out video: https://t.co/9OypFoxZk3
— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 24, 2015



The “New Shepard” vehicle flew to space (well, suborbit), reached its test altitude of 329,839 feet (100.5 kilometers) and then successfully landed vertically at the launch site in West Texas.

Among those congratulating Bezos and team was none other than SpaceX’s Elon Musk, who has been attempting something similar:


Congrats to Jeff Bezos and the BO team for achieving VTOL on their booster
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 24, 2015



However….Musk had more to say on the topic:


Getting to space needs ~Mach 3, but GTO orbit requires ~Mach 30. The energy needed is the square, i.e. 9 units for space and 900 for orbit.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 24, 2015





Jeff maybe unaware SpaceX suborbital VTOL flight began 2013. Orbital water landing 2014. Orbital land landing next. https://t.co/S6WMRnEFY5

https://t.co/TGWlNjsyQz
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 24, 2015



Musk is basically dissecting what they’ve done to show that each individual “achievement” by Blue Origin is not really an “achievement.” Musk is also referring to SpaceX’s Grasshopper testbed back in the Falcon 1 days. Also, NASA didn’t tweet, so I’m not sure how much of this I believe. Kidding. But come on, NASA.
Rocket shade. YEAH!


One day I hope to argue with another billionaire about which one of us has the oldest working hyperdrive.

363,Marijuana Startup Incubator “Gateway” Fires Up,https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/20/roll-up-that-term-sheet/,2015/11/20,"
“People should be focused on the business, not hanging out and getting high” insists Carter Laren, co-founder of marijuana startup funder and incubator Gateway, which launches today in Oakland, CA. But even if you’re stoned, you should be able to see the opportunity here. Marijuana prohibition is coming to an end, and massive businesses will grow in its place. Gateway wants to seed them.
This year Gateway will back two classes of 10 cannabis startups with $30,000 each plus five months of office space in exchange for 6% of their equity. The cash comes from LA’s Marijuana Investment Corporation (now just known as MJIC), and will fund further rounds for top performers after Gateway’s demo days. Applications, in the form of four-minute videos, open today for the first class starting in 2016.

As for the kinds of companies who’ll apply, Laren expects “a deluge of ‘X for cannabis’ and ‘the Uber of cannabis'”. There also might be pharmaceutical plays exploring cannabidiol. While THC has the psychoactive effects, CBD is the more medicinal, anxiety-muting, appetite-inducing element of weed. Laren also imagines plenty of applications from vaporizer and other hardware companies.
But Gateway won’t shy away from companies that actually handle the plant itself. Distribution services, cannabis quality testing, or extraction of the fun-time chemicals are all options for the incubator. They’ll get space in the quirky Leviathan building in Oakland, a hotbed of marijuana innovation that’s home to Oaksterdam, a school for marijuana dispensary owners.
Gateway’s startups will occupy the top floor of Oakland’s kooky Leviathan building
 
Why would startups give up 6% of their equity to Gateway? For general startup training but also access to industry-specific help like navigating regulation and securing permits. MJIC is already helping portfolio companies like Meadow (delivery), Willie Nelson’s “Willie’s Reserve” (marijuana brand), MyDx (chemical analyzer), Auntie Dolores (edibles), CannaFundr (equity crowdfunding), and New Frontier (data analysis).
Gateway co-founder Carter Laren
Gateway will be handing out 1% of its 6% stake in each company to mentors, ranging from experienced marijuana entrepreneurs to successful tech founders like the CEO of Rotten Tomatoes. Laren and fellow Gateway founder Ben Larson will bring their knowledge from working at the 100-city Founder Institute.
Along with competing for startups with top-tier programs like Y Combinator and 500 Startups, Gateway will have to battle other fledgling marijuana accelerators like Canopy. There’s also marijuana-focused VCs like Privateer Holdings and Snoop Dogg’s upcoming fund to contend with. Gateway hopes to differentiate by accepting very early stage companies including single founders, and connecting graduates to MJIC’s network of industry investors.
While the name might be funny, the connection to the negative perception of marijuana as a gateway drug could rub some the wrong way. Much of the industry is focused on dispelling that myth and poising weed as safer than alternatives like alcohol.
If Gateway can provide enough unique value, it could carve out a niche similar to how PCH’s Highway1 built a business as a hardware startup accelerator. After alcohol prohibition ended, megabrands like Budweiser and Miller made fortunes. Legal weed is expected to be a $15 billion market by 2020. As medicinal and recreational marijuana become legal in more states, Gateway wants to have the first money in the future kingpins of pot.

Earlier this year, Tesla CEO Elon Musk mentioned that the company intended to show off the Model 3 — its most affordable car to date by far, at $35,000 — in March of 2016. But as we’ve learned from the company’s adventures with the Model X, Tesla stuff can most definitely get delayed.
With that said: good news, Model 3 hopefuls! The Model 3 is still on track for an unveiling in March of 2016.
The progress update comes by way of Tesla’s Q3 2015 shareholder letter, in which Elon and Co. make but one fleeting mention of the Model 3:
Operating expenses should increase slightly in Q4, but reflect a further decline in Model X development expenses, offset by increased costs related to expanding our global sales capability and developing Model 3. We are on track to unveil Model 3 in late March 2016.
It’s worth noting, of course, that “unveiling” doesn’t mean “release” — actual production isn’t expected until some time in 2017. Tesla is still knee deep in shipping Model X pre-orders, after all.

Evan Williams’ venture firm, Obvious Ventures, has led a $3.5 million investment into solar financing and supply chain software developer Sighten.
Sighten looks like it provides tools for solar installers and project developers to optimize their buying power and improve the efficiency of their installations.
There are already a number of solar companies, including the integrated installation companies, that have picked up manufacturers and downstream vendors.
As the Rocky Mountain Institute reported in mid-2014:
Sunrun, a developer and financier, recently purchased the residential division of REC Solar, a major installer. SunPower moved into selling and financing solar systems, rather than just manufacturing modules. RGS Energy recently announced it will begin providing leasing in-house rather than through outside groups. And SolarCity, the country’s biggest solar developer, financier, and installer, just went so far as to buy a module manufacturer (Silevo).

Sighten’s leadership team comes from Clean Power Finance and is led by co-founder and chief executive Conlan O’Leary. In addition to competition from Clean Power Finance, here’s a list of a host of other vendors also tackling the back-end installation and procurement issues in the solar industry, courtesy of ENF Solar.
As a result of the Obvious investment (which doesn’t seem all that obvious to me), Andrew Beebe, who previously served as the vice president of distributed generation for NextEra Energy and chief commercial officer at Suntech, will take a seat on the Sighten board of directors.

Analysts expected SolarCity’s revenue to hit $111 million in third quarter 2015. But the solar energy company beat expectations with a near $114 million bump in revenue announced in earnings today.
That’s a 95.2 percent year-over-year increase, beating estimates by $2.43 million. This was “driven by increased installations and high system performance in our seasonally strong Q3,” according to the company.

However, SolarCity missed its Q3 EPS of -$2.41 by $0.46. This is before non-controlling interests and redeemable non-controlling interests. Shares started to plummet in after-hours trading, following the results, some points as low as 18 percent lower at $31.26 after earnings for Q3 went out.
Elon Musk, who holds the largest amount of shares in the company and is attributed for coming up with the idea, lost approximately $164.3 million this afternoon. Some have compared the company model to subprime loans.

Luckily the rise of the mobile phone and mobile money (such as M-PESA) has created a whole new industry which could allow clean energy to be paid-for by customers in developing countries in a manner where they can actually afford it.
A San Francisco startup called Angaza has come up with an innovative business model which employs a Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) system which it combines with clean energy. It’s now closed a Series A funding of $4 million, following its $1.5 million Seed round in 2013 to address the 1.2 billion people who currently live off the grid. The round was led by an unnamed US-based family office and was joined by New York-based The Social Entrepreneurs Fund and several others.
Most of the 1.2 billion people on the planet without electricity don’t have enough ready cash at one time to purchase a solar light or energy system outright and are therefore stuck in a perpetual cycle, having to spend up to 20% of their income to buy kerosene fuel to burn for light at night. PAYG allows off-grid families the opportunity to buy clean, reliable electricity in small, affordable increments. Angaza partners with manufacturers and distributors to provide them with a B2B PAYG solution.
Here’s how it works: Take someone in rural Kenya. They typically first learn about the possibility of purchasing a solar lantern through a local sales agent of one of Angaza’s distribution partners. After making a small “down payment” for the device ($1-5), they take the lantern (often with a mobile phone charging port) and solar panel home. The lantern will stay on for an amount of time proportional to the size of the payment that was made. After that amount of time has elapsed, the device deactivates and cannot be turned on again until another payment is made, just like buying pre-paid airtime on a mobile phone. They can then use the money in their mobile wallet to send a payment from their phone to the distribution company that sold them the lantern. The user can then continue to make weekly payments of $1-2 each until the lantern is fully paid for, typically in inside two to 12 months, depending on the size of the product.
This is in effect a magic bullet: It means sustainable solar energy for the customer, which they can pay off, ends their reliance on kerosene (which is massively polluting to the environment and a health hazard), and its also makes for a business model which doesn’t require yet more charitable donations. It also means distribution partners can see a four-to-five-fold increase in sales when they begin to offer PAYG, because the customers can actually afford to pay in these small increments via their mobiles. Boom!
Angaza’s solution consists of embedding a hardware subcircuit and firmware into a solar or other green energy device which provides both internal energy metering, so the device can deactivate if the pre-paid energy has been consumed; and a mobile wireless connection, so payment information can be sent to the unit, from which usage and diagnostic information can be remotely collected. The technology is integrated into clean energy devices to allow these devices to be paid for over time, in small increments.
The startup earns recurring revenue (a percentage of the transaction fees) off of every payment that is processed by its software platform. It also collects licensing fees from manufacturing partners who use its embedded technology.
And make no mistake, this is a big market. According to the Global Off-Grid Lighting Association (GOGLA) expects the off-grid energy and appliance market to be a $50 billion per year opportunity.
Angaza is the only company that offers a PAYG solution for even the smallest, ½-watt clean energy devices.
So far, distributors use Angaza’s platform to sell Pay-As-You-Go energy devices in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, Zambia, South Africa, India, and Pakistan.
While there are several other Pay-As-You-Go solar companies focused on the East Africa and Indian markets, they have taken a completely vertically integrated approach (e.g. M-KOPA and Off Grid Electric). This means that they manufacture their own product, build their own PAYG technology, distribute their products to end users, and provide after-sales support. But Angaza can sell to third-party manufacturers at a fraction of the cost it would take for them to develop it in-house, while leveraging Angaza’s existing traction and scale. Other companies, like Kingo, have chosen an end-to-end solution where they sell their devices AND the PAYG service in one platform, but must therefore rely on their own ability to scale.
The executive team comprises Lesley Marincola (CEO), Bryan Silverthorn (CTO) (who are brother and sister) and Victoria Arch (VP of Global Strategy). Its ten person San Francisco office includes primarily hardware and software engineers as well as a small business team. Its three person Nairobi office focuses on fostering partnerships with PAYG distributors.
Prior to founding Angaza, Marincola completed her B.S. and M.S. in Product Design and Mechanical Engineering at Stanford and worked at Amazon (Lab126) on the Amazon Kindle design team.

368,Kinetic Battery Startup Ampy Raises Seed To Shrink To Fit Wearables,https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/22/ampy-seed/,2015/10/22,"
Kinetic charging battery startup Ampy — which makes a wearable spare battery pack charged by human movement — has closed an $875,000 seed round led by Clean Energy Trust and NewGen Ventures. Angel investors including Howard Tullman, CEO of 1871; Steve Olechowski, co-founder of FeedBurner; and John DiNardi, co-founder of Norlux also participated.
The Chicago-based startup says it will be using the new funding to work on shrinking its tech to fit wearable devices such as smartwatches and fitness trackers, with the aim of expanding beyond its original consumer-focused proposition of a spare battery that can be charged while you walk/run/cycle.
“On integration [into wearable tech], we have prototyped it and proved the concept. We are now working on looking at our customers’ (wearables companies) needs in terms of not only size and power, but durability, comfort, etc,” CEO and co-founder Tejas Shastry tells TechCrunch.
The challenge is clearly whether it can shrink its magnetic charging tech to fit what can be very small wearable devices. Shastry touts the advantage of “flexibility in form factor” for manufacturers to work with it in reaching that embedded wearable tech goal. It is already apparently in talks with some makers.
The new seed financing will also be used for scaling production of its current consumer product — and expanding its six-strong team with new hires.
Ampy ran a crowdfunding campaign to turn its original human-powered prototype into a shipping product a year ago — going on to raise just under $310,000 on Kickstarter.

It says now that all devices will be shipped to backers by the end of November, adding that some have already been shipped. The campaign originally slated a June 2015 delivery schedule — but delay is no surprise for a hardware crowdfunder.
An Ampy spokesman says delays were down to it making some changes to the product itself — based on backer feedback (such as adding a LED to indicate how charged it is) — and also because it found that more work was required to get a supply chain in place and perform quality assurances on the first production parts.
The battery capacity of Ampy was also stepped up, from the 1,000mAh detailed in the crowdfunder — to 1,800mAh.

369,Apple Reveals Solar Energy Programs To Clean Up Its Manufacturing Partners In China,https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/21/apple-reveals-solar-energy-programs-to-clean-up-its-manufacturing-partners-in-china/,2015/10/21,"
Apple has plunged billions of dollars into making its global operations more efficient with renewable energy. The bulk of that push, which has won praise from Greenpeace, has come in the U.S. and Europe, but today Apple unveiled a suite of initiatives designed to make its business in China — the country where its revenue is positively booming — greener, too.
Timed in conjunction with CEO Tim Cook’s visit to the country, the U.S. company revealed that it will work with its manufacturing partners in China to help them “become more energy efficient and to use clean energy for their manufacturing operations.” Apple further explained that it is working with said suppliers, which include Foxconn, to add more than two gigawatts of ‘clean’ energy to those operations in the next few years.
That move alone is notable, since Apple’s China-based manufacturers have long been accused of polluting the environment. Back in 2011, iPhone supplier Pegatron was reprimanded over environmental concerns, while Apple reportedly clamped down on Foxconn and UniMicron in 2013 following accusations that they released water tainted by toxic metals into rivers.
One company’s initiatives won’t elicit a full clean up of China’s manufacturing industry, but Apple putting pressure on its partners to be more environmental friendly is a major development. Indeed, Foxconn’s own pledge today to create 400 megawatts of solar power by 2018 — the equivalent, it said, of the energy it uses for “final production” of the iPhone — is proof of the potential for change.
Apple also revealed today that its operations in China are now carbon neutral. That’s because — thanks to the completion of a 40 megawatts solar power system in the Sichuan Province — the company now produces more electricity in China than it uses in its offices and retail stores in the country.
The U.S. giant said it isn’t done there, and it plans to extend its solar projects with an additional 200 megawatts through projects in the north, east and south of China. It claimed that, once these additional facilities come online, its green energy production “will produce the equivalent of the energy used by more by than 265,000 Chinese homes in a year and will begin to offset the energy used in Apple’s supply chain.”

“Climate change is one of the great challenges of our time, and the time for action is now,” Cook said in a statement. “The transition to a new green economy requires innovation, ambition and purpose. We believe passionately in leaving the world better than we found it and hope that many other suppliers, partners and other companies join us in this important effort.”
Apple is certainly setting the bar for others to follow. The company is carbon neutral in the U.S. and China, while it claimed that renewable energy powers 87 percent of its international operations.

370,Business Models For Sustainable Electricity,https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/21/business-models-for-sustainable-electricity/,2015/10/21,"




H. Christine Richards
Contributor


H. Christine Richards is the research director for market research firm Zpryme.


As varied as the quirky spectrum of people dressed from t-shirts and shorts to suits and ties at SXSW Eco in Austin was the spectrum of sustainability topics covered — from improving fashion’s supply chain to building transportation hyperloops. For the first time ever, though, the workhorse of energy sustainability, the electric grid, was also tackled as a focal point.
These discussions reminded me that what has been essentially the same industry for 100 years is now being turned on its head. Chaos rules in the utility industry today. And that’s a good thing, because it’s enabling a much-needed sustainable transformation.
Yet how do companies find success in this turmoil?
The Big Issue: A Rapidly Changing Business Model
There are certainly issues driving change in the utility industry: climate change, aging infrastructure and distributed generation, for starters. How business models are changing in response to these is creating significant challenges — as well as opportunities.
“Digitizing” the grid is a somewhat recent step that started with the widespread introduction of smart meters. While utilities brought them in to primarily automate meter reading and customer billing, these meters and other digital grid technologies have actually unleashed ideas and companies that are shaking the very core of what it means to be a utility company, as evidenced by the ways SolarCity, Google and Comcast now work directly with consumers.
What is going to become of utilities? Who owns what? On one of the Eco panels, Michael Bates, Global Energy Director at Intel Corporation, said, “There will likely be utility companies that don’t survive in their current form.”
Yet even the business models of the companies challenging utilities are being shaken up. At SXSW Eco we learned how the business model of rooftop solar owned by individuals is shifting to community-owned solar. We also were told about smart thermostats being replaced by smart phones and about the impact of energy storage’s evolution.
The complexity of issues and scale of these changes means that success isn’t necessarily going to come from one source.
What will the business model look like for utilities companies, utility challengers and their technology providers? The solutions jumping in to save the day at this point seem to be anything from energy storage to nanotechnologies for sensors to water conservation. However, it isn’t so much about the specific solution as how it can address the broader changes happening in the industry and society.
Solutions To Those Issues
The complexity of issues and scale of these changes means that success isn’t necessarily going to come from one source. Solutions will need to consider how they fit into the bigger puzzle of electricity delivery and generation. Some thought-provoking considerations include:
Developing Products At Scale. There are a lot of great technologies out there, but as Kevin Phelan, Chief Marketing Officer at SoCore Energy, noted at Eco, “Real change only comes when you can apply it at scale.” Solutions need to demonstrate their usefulness at the scale of the grid or a community. This means looking to utilities as partners in ensuring the scalability of solutions. “Innovations and investments tend to come from disrupters, but the utility industry has the potential to be its own disrupter, too,” added Mike Carlson, President, Smart Grid NA at Siemens.
Outside Input Is A Must. Utilities are still just part of the mix, because sustainability challenges reach beyond these organizations. Partnerships need to include a variety of key stakeholders — from communities to the federal government to consumer advocacy groups.
Matching Up While Challenging Business Models. Companies need to find the right partners and do things at the right scale, but they still have to fit within a business model and nudge the industry to think about what’s next in electricity.
Thinking about the next generation’s business model for energy, and the partners to help get there, will help transform today’s chaos into sustainably based change.

371,Consumer Reports Withdraws Its Tesla Model S Recommendation,https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/20/in-shocking-turnaround-consumer-reports-withdraws-its-tesla-model-s-recommendation/,2015/10/20,"
In late August, a report out of Consumer Reports said that the Tesla Model S P85D, an all-wheel-drive electric sedan that also happens to be the most expensive model of the car, performed “better in our tests than any other car ever has, earning a perfect road-test score.”
We said at the time that the review was something you don’t see every day. But more shockingly, Consumer Reports has just assigned Tesla’s Model S a “worse-than-average” rating in a new, annual report about the predicted reliability of new vehicles.
Numerous outlets, including the L.A. Times, began reporting the bad news earlier. Shares of 12-year-old Tesla, which has a $26.5 billion market cap, have been in a nosedive since, falling 10.3 percent so far today.
According to Consumer Reports, in interviews with more than 1,400 Model S owners, an “array of detailed and complicated maladies” was brought to the outlet’s attention. The “main problems,” says the report’s authors, involve the drivetrain; power equipment; charging equipment; its giant iPad-like center console; and body and sunroof squeaks, rattles and leaks.
Specific areas that scored worse on the 2015 model, compared with last year’s model, says Consumer Reports, are its climate control, steering, and suspension systems.
Combined, the issues were enough to knock the car down from last year’s “average” reliability prediction. It also means the Model S can’t receive Consumer Reports’ widely coveted “recommended” designation. (To be recommended, says the organization, a vehicle has to “meet stringent testing, reliability, and safety standards, including having average or better predicted reliability.”)
Asked for comment, a Tesla spokesperson emailed us the following statement: “Consumer Reports also found that customers rate Tesla service and loyalty as the best in the world. Close communication with our customers enables Tesla to receive input, proactively address issues, and quickly fix problems. Over-the-air software updates allow Tesla to diagnose and fix most bugs without the need to come in for service. In instances when hardware needs to be fixed, we strive to make it painless.”
Indeed, Consumer Reports acknowledges that Tesla is working hard to address problems as they develop. As it states in its new report: “Despite the problems, our data show that Tesla owner satisfaction is still very high: Ninety-seven percent of owners said they would definitely buy their car again. It appears that Tesla has been responsive to replacing faulty motors, differentials, brakes, and infotainment systems, all with a minimum of fuss to owners . . . For its early adopters, Tesla has made a practice of overdelivering on service problems under the factory warranty.”
As for whether this new report could have a lingering impact for Tesla, Max Zanan, a longtime New York-based automotive retail expert, says he doubts it highly.
Zanan points to the car brand rated the most predictable by Consumer Reports: Buick. “If you go to any Buick dealership on earth, you can buy a car on the spot because people aren’t interested in boring cars like Buick,” he says.
Zanan also notes the rise Korean automaker of Kia and Hyundai, which respectively finished sixth and ninth in Consumer Reports’ reliability ratings. (Kia even beat Honda, and by a significant margin, says the outlet.)
“In the ’90s, Kia and Hyundai had poor reliability ratings, too” he says. “With time, they improved their processes and are now able to build very reliable cars with which consumers are very happy.”
Even more immediately, Tesla needn’t worry about blowback from the report, in Zanan’s view.
“Purchasing decisions aren’t guided by Consumer Reports,” he says. “They’re guided by feel of the car, marketing, and word of mouth.”

372,"PubNub Expands Series C To $25M, Banks On IoT To Boost Business On Its Messaging Network",https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/14/pubnub-expands-series-c-to-25m-banks-on-iot-to-boost-business-on-its-messaging-network/,2015/10/14,"
PubNub, the startup that has built a data network that carries messaging for apps, IoT hardware and other low-latency services, is today announcing that it has extended and closed its Series C round. The San Francisco-based company has raised $25 million, funding that it will use to sharpen its focus on Internet of Things applications and hardware as well as clean energy and social collaboration.
We first reported on the round in July, when originally PubNub had raised $20 million. To date, the company has now raised just over $40 million.
The round was led by Sapphire Ventures (originally SAP’s venture arm), with participation from Robert Bosch Venture Capital GmbH (RBVC) — the strategic investment arm of the consumer and business electronics giant Bosch — as well Ashton Kutcher’s Sound Ventures and Envision Ventures; as well as previous investors Relay Ventures, Scale Venture Partners and TiE Angels.
“We’re thrilled to join this investment round with PubNub, which we recognize is driving some of the hottest social and entertainment apps on the market,” said Ashton Kutcher, co-founder of Sound Ventures, in a statement. “We have a tremendous amount of confidence in the management team and believe PubNub is poised for exponential growth.”
The company is not disclosing revenues, profitability or valuation but when we asked about all these in July, CEO Todd Greene described the it as “rosy. Very solid and exciting.”
In any case, the company is growing pretty rapidly. When we covered the funding in July, it was sending messages across some 200 million devices. Three months later, that number is now up to 300 million devices. PubNub currently has some 2,000 customers and partners, with 750 billion realtime transactions processed per month on average.
While some of the company’s more recognizable customer names include Yahoo, McDonald’s and CBS, its new relationship with Bosch is likely to lead to PubNub’s numbers ramping up even further with a strong boost from enterprise apps around IoT.
“Bosch Group’s strategic goal is to deliver innovations for connected life. RBVC, the corporate venture capital company of Bosch, invests in the most innovative startups, paying particular attention to enabling technologies within the IoT space that can help to make everything from connected devices and cars, to industrial applications and manufacturing processes more intelligent,” said Luis Llovera, managing director at Robert Bosch LLC, in a statement. “With PubNub, we’re excited about how its secure, realtime and reliable Data Stream Network can be leveraged in these various IoT applications in innovative ways as it continues to expand its position in that area.”
As we noted in July, two areas where PubNub may be likely to invest in the months and years ahead is to build out its infrastructure and offer messaging relays across private networks. Today the company runs an amalgamation of operations across third-party data centers, something that it may look to shift as it moves deeper into M2M enterprise apps.
“Today we offer the service the global network on which people deploy applications. We don’t have anything to announce yet on hybrid solutions but it is something we are considering,” Greene told us in July. That will put PubNub also in closer competition with the likes of Realtime, Pusher and Google.

373,SolarCity Creates A 22% Module-Level Efficient Solar Panel,https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/02/solarcity-creates-a-22-module-level-efficient-solar-panel/,2015/10/02,"
Solar panels promise a lot – a cleaner, cheaper, renewable energy source, harnessed from the abundant rays of the sun. But the technology created to pull in that sun power can only go so far per square foot, depending on the panel.
SolarCity, the sun-powered startup founded by Elon Musk’s cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive, announced today that it has created the world’s most efficient solar panel, with a 22 percent module-level efficiency. Compare that to SunPower’s close rival X-Series panels at 21.5 percent module-level efficiency.
Bright, a startup out of Y Combinator that installs solar panels in Mexico, agreed that if SolarCity’s new panel is indeed producing a 22 percent module-level efficiency, it would make the panels the most efficient. At least on the surface.
“The big caveat is that once you use more expensive materials, such as GaAs, the efficiency for modules can go way up (north of 40 percent),” Bright founder Jonah Greenberger told TechCrunch.
SolarCity created its new panel via a proprietary process that it claims not only ups the performance, but also significantly reduces the manufacturing cost relative to other high-efficiency technologies at the same size as other solar panels, adding an additional 30 to 40 percent more power per panel.
The percentages of overall energy production and module-level can be confusing but don’t get lost in them. The gist is these panels promise to have a higher output at a lower production cost – and SolarCity says it is the most efficient solar panel at the moment, reducing waste – cuttings costs for both consumer and company and adding an attractive amount of power performance.
SolarCity backs up the claim with third-party, independent testing from the Renewable Energy Test Center, an energy services and certification testing facility for solar panel products.

The sun-powered provider expects to install these new panels on rooftops and carports, initially and then move to commercial installations.
SolarCity plans to produce a small batch of the new modules out of its 100 MW pilot facility in Fremont, California this month and then will move production to SolarCity’s 1 GW facility in Buffalo, N.Y. The company expects to produce 9,000 to 10,000 solar panels per day when production is in full swing.
The company recently announced an initiative to lower the cost of sun power for lower-income families. In a partnership with solar panel installation firm Everyday Energy, SolarCity will work with affordable-housing developers to install its solar systems in California.

374,Green Bits Launches Point Of Sale Service For Cannabis Shops,https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/22/green-bits-launches-point-of-sale-service-for-cannabis-shops/,2015/09/22,"
Originally, I was trying to come up with a really whip-smart headline for this…like: “Weed Is The Gateway Drug For Gateway Point Of Sale Services,” but there was no need. The news is simple: A super-smart group of folks that sold a company (Outright.com) to GoDaddy has launched its point of sale service specifically aimed at shops selling cannabis. They’re called Green Bits.

The team calls it “The easiest way to run your store” and it looks like they’re right. Sure, it tracks inventory of bud and accessories, but it keeps shops running legally by integrating with the WSLCB Traceability API.
Also, the software sports inventory reconciliation just in case someone who works for you is getting high on your supply. Mobile, too, for when you’re on the run or making deliveries yourself.
I spoke with the company’s co-founder and CEO Ben Curren about the company, the product and the future of the cannabis industry.



TC: Can you tell us why you founded the company?
BC: After selling Outright.com to GoDaddy, I decided to stop working and to play for a while. But I quickly became bored and couldn’t stop thinking about what I wanted to work on next. I spoke with Google X, and then a startup that builds small satellites. I realized that I enjoy the challenge of building businesses. So I stopped looking to join a company and decided to start one myself.
I turned to my Evernote folder of startup ideas. I’ve been adding to it for years. I curated and prioritized the list of ideas by my interest level and market size. I called Trae, the best engineer at Outright, and asked if he’d be interested in investigating some business ideas with me. We ended up building drones and a smart sprinkler system before landing on a note that said, “Look at the cannabis industry.” I don’t even remember writing it, but it launched my research into an emerging market.
I found a conference the following day and flew to Washington state to attend. Legalization of marijuana had passed in 2012, and the attendees were preparing for the first stores to finally open in a few months — July 2014. The two-day conference got me in direct contact with business owners jumping into the field. I was also introduced to all the regulatory compliance issues and the current solutions. I’ve built accounting, payroll, and tax solutions for small business for over 15 years and immediately knew the pain these businesses were soon to be in.
TC: Tell us about the team, where they came from and how they fit into Green Bits
BC: I went to Cal Poly and then became an Intuit Engineer working on Quickbooks. Then I started my own consulting firm, but I had trouble finding an accounting program that worked the way I wanted it to work. So I designed accounting software called Outright that was made for freelancers. Eventually I sold it to GoDaddy. I used the proceeds to launch Green Bits. In my spare time, I like to build drones and get away with my family — well, my wife makes us get away to places off the grid so I can’t work all the time.
I have two co-founders — Trae Robrock and Andrew Katz, both of whom helped me build Outright. Trae, who I mentioned earlier, is our CTO. Like me, Trae loves building software for small businesses and he loves learning how to further automate their day-to-day operations. He’s what you’d call “an engineer of all things” — so you’re likely to find him building something else when not at his desk building software. Or with my cousin, who he married, and their new baby.
Andrew has been designing, developing and managing web applications since he was a student at Cal Poly. At Outright, Andrew was responsible for mobile development and led the team responsible for the financial data import system and integration with third-party APIs.
TC: What do you think the future of the cannabis industry is?
BC: The legalization of cannabis is going to have a profound impact on our society. The future will see some of the following benefits from the cannabis industry:

Drug abuse will be treated as a social problem rather than criminal. Millions of people will have an opportunity to get healthy and become a contributing member of society rather than a burden on the system.
States will generate tens of millions of dollars of tax revenue to put towards improving the lives of their citizens.
Scientists will be able to study all the compounds of cannabis to understand its true health benefits. Some compounds like CBD have already been shown to have significant impact treating certain diseases and who know what else we’ll find.
Hemp production will create more efficient and environmental building materials such as paper, clothing, fuel, and plastics. These products will be created for less money, be biodegradable, and last longer than the current options.
Many multi-national businesses will be created around the recreational use of marijuana. Like the wine industry, thousands of brands, retail chains, will be established for consumers. Technology providers, like Green Bits, will exist to help these providers grow, package, distribute, and sell marijuana products efficiently to their customers.

“Drug abuse will be treated as a social problem rather than criminal. Millions of people will have an opportunity to get healthy and become a contributing member of society rather than a burden on the system.”— Ben Curren
TC: What needs to change legally so that this company, and others in the space, can grow?
BC: Green Bits needs the current legalization momentum to continue. The cannabis industry grew 74 percent in 2014, making it the fastest growing industry in the U.S. according to The ArcView Group. There are currently four states with legal recreational (21 and over) marijuana, and 24 with legal medical marijuana. Next year, there should be another six states, including California, with marijuana legalization on the ballot. This trend is not only domestic; worldwide, countries are legalizing or thinking of legalizing in the near future.

TC: How much have you raised?
BC: We haven’t raised any outside capital. I used some proceeds from the sale of Outright to start the company. Green Bits provides a valuable service that companies are willing to pay for, so cash flow is pretty good. Many of our customers opt to pay yearly. That saves them money and makes it easier for us to scale.
TC: What are your plans for growth? (pun intended)
BC: Green Bits point-of-sale currently runs over 45 percent of the recreational marijuana stores in Washington. We’re excited to announce at TechCrunch Disrupt that we now support the regulations in Colorado and Oregon. We’re the only solution that is able to completely automate compliance reporting for our customers. In 2016, we’ll add support for the additional 24 states where medical marijuana is legal, and then move to international markets.
TC: Any interesting anecdotes you can share that happened during the early days of the company?
BC:
Testing the Market
Around May 2014, we had a good idea what we thought our initial product should be. We wanted to test the concept but we didn’t build the product yet. So, we searched the web for photos of an iPad based register, used Photoshop to add a rendering of our proposed software, and created a very basic website. We then created a flyer, included in the assets we provided, and mailed it to every marijuana retailer expecting to open July 2014 in Washington. Yes, snail mail not email. We were able to generate over 100 incoming calls where I was able to test various pitches and pricing models to see who would sign up. This first group of callers ended up being our beta testers and our first batch of customers.

First store launch
Around July 2014, we were starting to prepare to launch our first customer, 2020 Solutions in Bellingham Washington. It was crunch time and we were working like crazy to get the first version of our software together. We knew that the state regulatory system we had to integrate with wasn’t live yet so it was impossible to test or verify anything worked. So instead of automating the integration with the state system we built a way for all requests to come to us where we manually submitted them.
The day the store launched there was a line two blocks down the street with CNBC filming. With all that pressure and sales the engineers were back in the office manually submitting sales to the state while building an automated solution. It took about three days to finish the integration and make the compliance completely automated.
Another amusing story of this trip is that I flew up about seven days early to the store. I worked with the staff and the owners to tag all the products, enter the inventory into Green Bits, test sales. In that one week we completely changed the product design three times before launching.
———
To be taken seriously as an industry, companies are going to need to go completely legit. That means tracking sales, filing taxes, paying full-time employees and providing benefits. That means that companies like Green Bits can slide right in and help out immediately. Plus, this business might be a little too sticky for Square or PayPal to jump into…so there’s the opportunity.
As a first-mover, the team can do some serious damage by signing up shops from every state in the US that starts relaxing its current marijuana laws. And hey, maybe they can nab Snoop Dogg as an investor.

375,FLUID Is A Smart Water Meter For Your Home,https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/15/fluid-is-a-smart-water-meter-for-your-home/,2015/09/15,"
Did you take a shower this morning? That’s 30 gallons of water down the drain. Flush the toilet a couple of times? That’s another four or five gallons. Run the dishwasher, too? Add another six gallons, at least.
The average American consumes 80 to 100 gallons of water each day — the equivalent of around 700 half-liter water bottles. And that number doesn’t include outdoor water consumption by sprinklers or hoses.
In California, snow accumulation levels have plunged to a 500-year low. We’re aware of the severity of the drought, but monitoring and reducing personal water usage is a thankless task.
You want me to count how many seconds I’m in the shower for? Yeah, okay. Bet my neighbors aren’t doing that.
This is exactly the behavior that FLUID wants to change. Launched yesterday on Kickstarter, FLUID is a smart water meter that helps you understand exactly when, where and how much water you’re consuming in your home on a daily basis.
“Right now consumers get a water bill every month and it’s in units, not gallons, so you have to flip the sheet over and do some math to find out how many gallons you’re using,” says FLUID co-founder Josh Becerra. “FLUID is really about empowering consumers to take more control over their water usage.”
FLUID simply snaps around the main water pipe in your home. You plug it in, connect it to your Wi-Fi, and download the FLUID app to access real-time reports on your iPhone or Android.
Using ultrasonic technology — essentially sending pulses from one ultrasonic transducer to another — the device is able to measure the rate of water flow without cutting into the pipe.
What’s even cooler is how FLUID knows exactly where the water is coming from.
Each appliance in your house, whether it be the kitchen faucet, the bedroom toilet, or the washing machine, has a signature run rate, or the rate and the duration of water flow through the pipe while that machine is running.
Teaching FLUID what this run rate is, exactly, takes a bit of work. In the app, you can instruct FLUID to “listen” while you run each appliance for its typical duration, whether that’s a 30-minute washing machine cycle or a flush of the toilet. Once FLUID captures and memorizes these signatures, it’s able to differentiate between multiple appliance or fixtures running at the same time.
“We want people to have a much more direct relationship with their water consumption,” says FLUID co-founder Colin Hirdman. “Hopefully the end result is using less water — and spending less money on water — but we want them to be able to identify how, where and when they’re using water themselves.”
So instead of leaving the sink running while I’m brushing my teeth, maybe I’ll remember to turn it off when I realize exactly how many gallons of water are going down the drain. Or instead of running the dishwasher when it’s barely half full, maybe I’ll take out the bowl I need and wash it by hand — especially since I spent hours trying to teach my water meter what every appliance in my house sounds like.

In the case of a leak, FLUID serves as a disaster prevention tool, alerting you immediately before your basement floods and your water bill spikes to all new heights.
With a price tag of $239, or $179 for early bird Kickstarter backers, FLUID will pay for itself in under an hour if you have a burst pipe and in five days if your toilet is running.
After the Kickstarter wraps up in October, the device will retail for $299 on FLUID’s site. The first devices are slated to ship in May 2016.
In the future, FLUID will integrate with existing smart home hubs, such as Nest or SmartThings, and provide a REST API so developers can build their own integrations.
“Once people start to become aware of how much water they use, they’ll be able to start saving water,” says Hirdman. “And once they start saving, they’ll want to save more, and they’ll become even more creative about how they do that.”
It’s a rather optimistic view of human behavior, especially in regards to natural resource consumption, but let’s hope he’s onto something.

376,"Eatsa, A Futuristic Restaurant Where Robot Cubbies Serve Quinoa",https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/31/eatsa/,2015/08/31,"
Eatsa has no lines because it has no cashiers. You order on an iPad, your name comes up on a transparent LCD screen box, and you pull out a bowl of quinoa. Opening today in San Francisco at 121 Spear St, Eatsa is a new restaurant designed around technology.
Eatsa only serves quinoa, a couscous-like grain that’s high in protein and absorbs flavor well, but is cheaper and more environmentally sustainable than meat. Eatsa was funded by David Friedberg, who sold his farming insurance startup The Climate Corporation for around $1 billion.
Eventually, Eatsa hopes its combination of tech and quinoa can change the way we eat.
Friedberg told me he imagines Eatsa restaurants built into shipping containers and dropped into neighborhoods with no sources of healthy foods. Since you always pay by credit card or mobile, he hopes to create discounts for regulars that increase every time you dine at Eatsa. And by experimenting with flavor on the molecular level, Eatsa wants to make meals that taste delicious and indulgent yet are healthy for you.
Come grab a meal alongside TechCrunch in our demo video (above) of the Eatsa experience.

377,How Technology Is Fueling The Push Toward Solar,https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/30/how-technology-is-fueling-the-push-toward-solar/,2015/08/30,"

Megan Birney is director of strategic affairs at Wiser Capital.


Solar energy in the United States has seen immense momentum throughout the years. When the Solar Energy Industries Association released its annual report in 2008, it concluded that U.S. solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity reached a total of 1.183 gigawatts — a stellar achievement at the time.
Contrast that figure with today, and the number is dwarfed by the United States’ installed capacity of 21.3 gigawatts, enough energy to power 4.3 million homes.
As to what is powering this widespread adoption, one only needs to look at the residential market. According to recently released research by GTM, 72 percent of the market growth in 2014 is a result of solar tech companies offering diverse financing solutions and easy-to-navigate web platforms. Going solar for homeowners has become as easy as online shopping.
The commercial sector isn’t as fortunate, outside of a few large-scale projects driven by Fortune 500 and utility companies. This impasse is mostly because small and mid-scale companies face a number of complications when it comes to investing in solar — the largest being a lack of easy and cost-efficient methods to evaluate and mitigate the risk of any given project.
Tech is changing that. First it made waves in the residential sector, introducing seamless tech platforms with creative financing options to make solar a reality for homeowners. Now it’s paving a path for similar, widespread national success in the commercial space.
Outpacing Commercial Solar
We often hear of large companies, like Wal-Mart, Amazon and Target, deciding to go solar in a move that makes both economic sense and decreases their carbon footprint. If you were to search for large commercial solar sites, such as major corporate headquarters, metropolitan arenas or vast solar arrays, you wouldn’t be hard pressed to find them. They’re abundant, and they’re generally well publicized as a part of any company’s corporate social-responsibility program.
The future of solar has never looked brighter.
However, just because we know of an Apple or Google going solar doesn’t necessarily mean that the greater commercial solar industry is on a consistent upward swing. It is merely a segment of the market that is able to access renewable energy at scale because of their vast resources and investor relations. A significant portion of small and medium-sized enterprises are not adopting solar at record rates.
In fact, in 2014 the commercial solar market was no longer the leading market segment when it came to installed capacity — that’s when residential took over. This flip of leading markets is due to two facts: one being that residents are able to install PV systems at cost-effective rates thanks to technology advancements in established solar companies, the other being that a significant portion of the commercial market is bottlenecked and untapped.
An untapped market is untapped potential, and the tech industry is beginning to take note.
Bringing Small And Medium-Sized Businesses To The Solar Grid
When it comes to making the actual investment, large corporations have economies of scale that drive down costs and increase efficiencies. Additionally, financing of solar projects for these large corporations is generally easier to come by, typically because they have reliable and accessible public credit ratings that satisfy Wall Street’s risk evaluation and mitigation criteria.
Aside from large commercial facilities, we are left with the small to medium-sized firms that haven’t been able to go solar in similar numbers as the nation’s homeowners and their large corporate brethren. Think restaurants, wineries, galleries, printing shops, local gift stores and local religious community centers.
With complex tariff modeling, demand charges, time-of-use rates and limited roof space, as well as layers upon layers of decision-making, an average sales cycle can eclipse 12-18 months. That is if the deal ever closes.
To top it off, most of these smaller commercial facilities lack those readily available and reliable public credit ratings enjoyed by corporations, so even if they are able to navigate the design process, persuading external investors of the viability of the project can be an uphill battle.
This is all changing, and the credit can be given to technology and innovation. With design and modeling tools from companies like HelioScope, Energy Toolbase, Wiser Capital and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s Building Component Library (built in conjunction with Concept 3D), the solar industry is beginning to access a large, often ignored market.
These companies have been able to develop software to streamline a complex design and modeling process, enabling solar systems to seamlessly work for the specific needs of small and medium-sized businesses.
The bulk of whether or not your favorite mom-and-pop sandwich shop down the street is going to go solar, however, largely rests on ensuring the cost of capital falls within acceptable risk tolerances for the deal to deliver required returns.
Again, because these types of facilities typically lack reliable and readily accessible public credit ratings that satisfy investor risk evaluation criteria, the cost of capital has generally been too high for many of these projects to take off.
An untapped market is untapped potential, and the tech industry is beginning to take note.
SolarCity, however, just announced its own foray into this space, utilizing California’s Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing programs to attach a solar lease agreement to a building’s property, essentially negating the need for a risk-rating score. Unfortunately, this option is currently limited to California.
The greater solution lies in technology. If every facility and project could earn a consistent, transparent and highly automated score, then the entire U.S. market would open up.
My own firm utilizes a proprietary cloud-based platform to optimize savings and determine any given project’s bankability. By automating the process and creating a marketplace for hosts, installers and investors, we have successfully brought new capital into a once stagnant market.
This underserved market is driving a new boom in solar. According to the 2015 Solar Investment Index, for example, a staggering 83 percent of investors will make an investment in solar a priority in the next five years, with one in five already having made commercial solar investment a priority in the same timeframe.
A Bright Future
It’s becoming increasingly clear that the new boom in solar lies in the innovation and disruptive nature of tech bringing down the cost of capital required to make more solar projects possible, as well as simplifying the entire design and sales cycle.
This is true of both markets. Homeowners have been able to reap the joys of lower electricity costs while ensuring a positive impact on the environment, and now the small and medium-sized business market is starting to enjoy similar benefits.
The future of solar has never looked brighter.

378,Programmer Drives His Tesla Model S A Record-Breaking 452.8 Miles On A Single Charge,https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/25/programmer-drives-his-tesla-model-s-a-record-breaking-452-8-miles-on-a-single-charge/,2015/08/25,"
Tesla’s Model S, a “premium performance” sedan with dual-motor, all-wheel drive, is advertised as having a 265-mile range, according to the company. But Bjørn Nyland, a programmer at the University of Oslo who lovingly calls his two-year-old Tesla “The Millennium Falcon” (he also has a YouTube channel dedicated primarily to his Tesla and their travels together), has apparently just set a world record.
Nyland says he just drove a stunning 728 kilometers, or 452.8 miles, on a single charge in his car after “fueling up” at a supercharger station in Rødekro, Denmark.
According to Tesla, the last record of its kind was recorded in May 2012, when a father and son drove 423.5 miles on a single charge.
For what it’s worth, Nyland has no financial relationship with Tesla, says the company. He just really loves his car, seemingly. 
Nyland and the charitable friend who drove with him had to cruise an excruciatingly slow 25 miles-per-hour at near zero elevation to pull off the feat. Video taken by Nyland of his trip is about as exhilarating as you’d expect as a result. Still, you can check it out right here:

379,Controversial Climate-Change Solution May Be In The Clouds,https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/24/an-even-more-inconvenient-truth-about-climate-change/,2015/08/24,"

In a move that has some environmentalists up in arms, a group of retired Silicon Valley engineers and scientists are proposing a new approach to fighting climate change. They want to brighten clouds.
It’s one of the many solutions being proposed in the controversial industry of geoengineering.
For the last seven years, the Marine Cloud Brightening Project (MCBP) team has been meeting on a weekly basis at a lab in Sunnyvale, California. Their aim is to counteract global warming by shooting water droplets into the sky to buffer up existing clouds, thereby reflecting temperature-increasing sunrays back into the atmosphere.
The engineering team, who range in age from 60 to 79 years, is a star-studded group of tech pioneers that includes Armand Neukermans, who helped develop some of the earliest ink jet printers, pharmaceutical chemist Gary Cooper and instrument designer Lee Galbraith.
After seven years, it is now time to test how successfully their machine can shoot tiny seawater droplets into the atmosphere in order to “boost the brightness of clouds,” which, in turn, would reflect rays of sunlight back from where they came.
If climate change is real, eventually things will get painful for everybody. — Klaus S. Lackner
“We are interested in an insurance policy for global warming,” said 79-year-old physicist and laser pioneer, Jack Foster, in a recent interview with the San Jose Mercury News. “We are not interested in deploying it unless it’s necessary. But we’d like to have something available, so we know what works and what doesn’t.”
This is uncharted territory for a couple of reasons. First, clouds are one of the least understood aspects of meteorology. Second, mention the term “geoengineering” in public and most people run screaming. It is an ethical minefield, not to mention virtually impossible to find research funding for.
Even if it were to work, deliberately manipulating the climate could have unforeseen negative consequences down the road.
Clouds are one of the least understood aspects of meteorology.
Critics also argue that any apparent panacea for climate change may send out the wrong signals to a general populace who need to be thinking and acting more environmentally anyway.
Still, the scientists involved are concerned that eventually someone else may decide to try this approach. Early, open research by high-caliber personnel will make the whole thing a little more palatable.
“It’s not new,” says Kelly Wanser, CEO of Luminus Networks and Director of the MCBP. “The fact is humanity is already engaged in unplanned climate engineering. We’re doing it through coal plant and shipping emissions every day without understanding it very well.”
Wanser is referring to phenomena in which current global shipping and industrial emissions already put particles into the clouds that are producing a cooling effect on the climate, somewhere between one and four degrees Fahrenheit, according to some experts.
“Cloud scientists are already observing how various industrial practices impact clouds and climate more generally,” she adds. “But there lies the problem: all they can do is observe. They cannot control experimentally to understand the key processes occurring between particle emissions and clouds that are having a huge impact on climate.
“That’s where the MCBP is coming from. Most of the atmospheric research team were initially opposed to the idea of engineering the climate, but were very interested in studying clouds this way to fill critical gaps in climate understanding.”
Deliberately manipulating the climate could have unforeseen negative consequences down the road.
Have the skeptics in the group changed their minds about climate engineering? “The climate change picture has gotten darker,” says Wanser. “So even those opposed have come to the conclusion that, given the current trajectory we’re on, it’s important we at least research these ideas. We need to understand whether this approach is even possible and what the risks are, in the event that we find ourselves looking for ways to extend time and mitigate warming damage.”
Rob Wood is one of the country’s leading cloud scientists and a member of the MCBP. He is skeptical, but still appreciates the importance of trying to understand how this technology works.
“If we have a means to carry out controlled experiments, we can understand this problem better,” Wood says. “Only then can we figure out the long-term impact of what is essentially already happening through various industrial practices.”
It’s clear the MCBP is the first to admit the potential pitfalls of the research. They are keen to dispel any fears people might have. But geoengineering is a deeply divisive branch of science that raises as many questions as it might have potential answers to.
“It’s a bit like trying to solve a city’s garbage problem by putting everyone’s houses on stilts,” says Klaus S. Lackner, director of the Center for Negative Carbon Emissions at Arizona State University. “It doesn’t solve the problem. Just kicks the can down the road. I view solar radiation management in the same way. It is an emergency response to a rapidly changing climate. It won’t solve the underlying problem. Plus it might even create problems of its own.”
“That being said,” he adds, “if we refuse to learn about it and then have a crisis, we won’t know any better and just do what’s cheapest. It’s always better to learn. If climate change is real, eventually things will get painful for everybody. At that point, we should at the very least aim to try things we already understand.”

Circle Medical — The Doctor That Comes To You
Circle Medical will send a primary care physician to your house to do everything you could get done at a doctor’s office, from checkups to blood tests. Users just scan their insurance card, and Circle Medical tells them which services they’re qualified to receive for free. Because 75% of doctor visit costs go to the office, Circle Medical can pay doctors $140 an hour while earning $60 for itself. It already has three full-time doctors in SF. To acquire users, it has a workplace program where employers block out time for multiple employees to see a Circle Medical doctor. It’s been able to gain users for just $5 each this way. That could let Circle Medical make health easier while breaking into the $300 billion a year primary medical care market. Read our full TechCrunch post about Circle Medical.

Ixchel Scientific — Accurate pharmaceutical testing
Most drugs are first tested in 2D petri dishes that don’t behave like real human organs, which leads to a 95% failure rate for the drugs that make it to testing on humans. Ixchel Scientific has developed a 3D gel matrix that mimics the structure of human organs, so drugs can be more accurately tested. Ixchel was founded by PhDs who’ve worked on the technology for 15 years, and have had the research published in top scientific journals. Their 3D gel matrix could reduce the cost of drug testing, getting us closer to cures for cancer and other ailments, while taking a cut of the huge $28 billion medical testing resource market.

Xendit — Venmo for Southeast Asia
Xendit is building Venmo for Southeast Asia with instantaneous peer-to-peer mobile payments. This is key in the region because only 15% of the region’s consumers have debit or credit cards and the vast majority of transactions happen in cash. Meanwhile, mobile phone penetration has grown to about 120% penetration (as many consumers have more than one phone). That presents an enormous opportunity for mobile commerce. Since launch, Xendit has acquired 13,000 users and is growing 50% week over week. They’ve handled 1.5 billion rupiah in Indonesia, or about $110,000.

Tab. — Let merchants in developing nations accept credit card payments
Buying things while on vacation can be tough. Merchants often lack credit card machines. Those that have them are often gouged for 7% by local providers, and tourists still have to pay a 4% fee. Tab. has created an app that lets merchants accept payments with just a smartphone. They’re charged only 1%, and tourists pay less too as transactions happen in their home currency. With 40% week over week growth thanks to word of mouth amongst merchants, Tab. is rapidly growing to take a chunk of the $40 billion in transaction fees paid on tourism payments in emerging markets. Soon you won’t need cash anywhere.

Branch8 – Lets merchants sell on every major Asian ecommerce platform
In America, Amazon and eBay dominate ecommerce, but in Asia, the market is fragmented amongst 200 markets. Most merchants don’t have time to maintain presences on all of them, but Branch8 does it for them automatically. In exchange for a 1% commission on sales, Branch8 handles items, prices, and stock on all the platforms, earnings merchants more money. Now, ecommerce platforms are baking Branch8 into their onboarding, speeding growth as the startup tries to make all ecommerce rely on it. Read our full TechCrunch post on Branch8.

CareLedger — A better way for employers to buy medical procedures
Some medical procedure providers cost more than others for no reason. CareLedger works with a business’ existing health insurance to find the best, cheapest provider of procedures their employees need, saving an average of 50% on each procedure. It pays any out-of-pocket costs for the employees too. And it brings fair-cost providers more business. CareLedger then keeps 30% of the money it saved the business, which could amount to $90 billion in revenue if every business in the US switched to it. It’s a win for everyone except companies charging too much for medical care. Read our full TechCrunch post on CareLedger

Wheelys Cafe — A full-service cafe on a bike
2 billion cups of coffee are served per day but one of the main costs is rent. Wheelys lets entrepreneurs avoid these costs by putting a full coffee, juice, and snack-dispensing cafe on a bike-drawn cart. The cart costs just $3,000 and can be pedaled between the best spots to sell, while “a Starbucks is really heavy” says the co-founder. Parked outside a Starbucks, the Wheelys CEO served 210 customers by lunch while the Starbucks had only served 148. Beyond selling the carts, Wheelys also sells the supplies. Eventually, it wants to build a network of the carts where people can pay with an app like Uber. Read our full TechCrunch post on Wheelys.

Transcend Lighting — Efficient Indoor Grow Lighting
Indoor agriculture, with its enhanced control over quality, is growing quickly, but the second biggest cost to farmers is lighting. Transcend has invented a patent-pending photosynthetic LED light that’s 35% to 50% more efficient than competitors. “And no, it’s not just for pot…although we do quite well in the cannabis industry”, the co-founder says. Traditional tomato and lettuce growing are its core business. It saved $150,000 for a farm that was planning on just $120,000 of profit, more than doubling their success and making the lights return their cost quickly. Transcend could let more food be grown inside for a lot cheaper. Read our full TechCrunch post on Transcend Lighting.

TetraScience — Cloud-connected scientific instruments
Researchers still use old-school instruments, monitor them in person, and log data with pen and pencil. TetraScience creates cloud-connected instruments like thermometers that let researchers monitor experiments remotely, get alerts, and automatically log data. Major pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, and universities like the co-founders’ alma mater Harvard are already using TetraScience instruments. Now it’s partnering with instrument makers like Corning to embed its software into their wares. Science is going to the cloud, and TetraScience could accelerate that shift. Read our full TechCrunch post on TetraScience.

Xfers — PayPal for Southeast Asia
Most of Southeast Asia has less than a 5% credit card penetration rate, leading to low usage of PayPal and most ecommerce purchases being paid for with cash on demand. Xfers has erected a payment network on top of the existing online bank accounts most people have, and APIs it built for the local banks. With a growing middle class, the region could be spending $350 billion on ecommerce just 5 years from now. Just a 1% fee could earn Xfers $3.5 billion in this rapidly evolving market.

—
Serica — Financial backbone for the cannabis industry
The marijuana business is growing 15% year-over-year. But businesses in the US can’t use traditional banking or credit for legal reasons, and rely on cash management. Serica offers a blockchain-based finance system that can handle online payments, and is starting to manage payroll and supplier invoicing. For clients, it can often be the only way they can accept money online, which can boost growth…so Serica’s clients can sell more medicinal pot. [Correction: Serica does not work with marijuana growers, only medicinal delivery services.]

Leada — Teaching Professionals Data Science
Data is a bottleneck for many business decisions because companies don’t have enough data scientists. Rather than hire a specialist, Leada lets businesses pay to train their employees to be “data literate” with a 12 hour online course. Leada says training 100 Zenefits operations employees saved Zenefits $75,000 a month through better decision-making. Leada likens data literacy today to being able to type in 1970, and sees a huge market training every professional to understand data science.

Seva Coffee — A roasting machine with unroasted cofee beans
As soon as coffee beans are roasted from green to brown, they start to lose their flavor. Yet most coffee, especially drunk at home or the office, is still made with pre-roasted beans. Seva Coffee has invented a machine that takes pods of unroasted green coffee beans, automatically roasts and grinds them to your preference, and pours a great cup of coffee. The company sells the machine for thousands of dollars and the pods for $1 each with 75% gross margins. It’s starting with the corporate office market, but eventually wants people making coffee from fresh beans at home.

381,Google’s Project Sunroof Tells You How Well Solar Would Work On Your Roof,https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/17/panel-panel-on-the-roof/,2015/08/17,"
Google now lets you see if your house is a good candidate for installing solar panels. Project Sunroof, a 20 percent project by Google engineering lead Carl Elkin, shows you how much solar power your roof could generate using Google Maps and the data it has about the surroundings of your home. This means it can take into account local weather, your roof’s orientation and how much shade falls on it from nearby trees and buildings.
Sadly, this currently only works in the San Francisco Bay Area, Fresno (which Google helpfully tells us is in central California) and Boston (a major city on the East Coast, as far as we are aware).
To get started, you simply plug in your address and some data about your monthly electricity bill, and the tool will tell you what the recommended solar installation size is and how much it would cost to buy or lease the hardware.
In case you want to go ahead with a solar install, the tool also lets you reach out to local solar providers. Google says these listings are sponsored, so chances are it’ll get a bit of a kickback when it generates a sales lead for these companies.

382,Oolu Is Bringing Solar Energy To West Africa’s Off-Grid Population,https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/31/oolu-is-bringing-solar-energy-to-west-africas-off-grid-population/,2015/07/31,"
In rural West Africa, 150 million people are currently living without electricity.
Oolu, a Y Combinator company launching today, aims to reduce this number by delivering affordable solar energy to West Africa’s off-grid population, beginning in Senegal.
Despite the surge of innovation in solar storage and panel technology, Oolu founder Daniel Rosa says that many people living in rural areas of West Africa still walk miles to the nearest city to charge their cellphones and purchase kerosene for lanterns.
According to Rosa, the average rural family spends around $20 per month on energy-related costs. Considering that Senegal’s GDP per capita was just over $1,000 in 2012, this is a huge expense for many families.
Oolu’s in-home solar system is composed of three adjustable lights and two USB plugs, powered by a battery that holds a charge for up to six hours with maximum output.
For a low monthly fee, Oolu will install the system and perform all necessary maintenance, including free battery replacements and system upgrades.
The company is not disclosing its exact prices (and it anticipates the cost to differ slightly by region), but Rosa says that Oolu has been able to save families an average of 60 percent on total energy spending.
“These communities are, by and large, farmers of cash crops,” says Rosa. “The average Senegalese family is very large — the average household size is ten people — so each family has several cellphones that they need to charge twice a week.”
Oolu’s innovation isn’t the technology behind the solar products that they’re dispensing. The systems are produced by a large manufacturer, and similar products are already being used in areas of East Africa.
Instead, the company’s true feat is setting up a distribution model and payment infrastructure that West African families and community leaders are comfortable with. Oolu has partnered with Orange Money, a Senegalese money transfer company, so that customers can pay the monthly subscription fee from their mobile phones.
“We’re working with Orange Money to bring not only solar, but also mobile payments and mobile banking to millions of rural people,” says Rosa. “People talk about a solar revolution, but really it’s a solar mobile revolution.”
Prior to starting Oolu, Rosa’s co-founder Nilmi Senaratna worked with children in a rural region of Senegal through the Canadian International Development Agency.
“We were tutoring these kids at night, using flashlights and very bad quality lanterns and candles to study,” Senaratna says. “We would even use the dim light of a cellphone to study at night.”
Senaratna began thinking about ways to bring modern technology to communities that are very hesitant to trust outsiders. That’s why the company’s name, “Oolu,” is a word in the local language Wolof that translates to “trust.”
“Rural people are very used to being let down because so many organizations come in and promise wonderful things and then they don’t deliver,” says Senaratna. “Our name speaks to the fact that we’re holding ourselves to a very high standard; when we say we’ll be back with enough systems for your whole community in a week, we do that.”

Oolu has employed a team of 10 people, working on the ground in Senegal, to communicate with clients in-person and aid in the installation of systems.
After a year-long pilot, the company has signed up 500 clients in Senegal. Rosa and Senaratna say they expect to reach 1500 clients by the end of the summer, and they’re planning to launch in another French-speaking West African country in the near future.
And in-home solar systems are just the beginning. Oolu plans to eventually offer a variety of products, from agricultural technology to consumer electronics, to rural West African families using its combination of mobile payments and on-the-ground community support infrastructure.
“The reason why we got into this business in the first place was to work with rural communities to find ways to provide them the technology they really need,” says Rosa. “It’s not just about solar, we really hope to impact these communities beyond that by bringing modern services to rural people.”

383,Google Straps Aclima Sensors To Street View Cars To Map Air Pollution,https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/28/software-eats-smog/,2015/07/28,"
If a city knows what intersections are full of smog, it could add trees or change stop light schedules to improve the air its citizens breathe. Google Earth’s Outreach program that equips nonprofits and public-benefit organizations with data wants to give the world these insights.
So today, Google revealed that it’s been working with SF startup Aclima for the last year-and-a-half to attach air-quality sensors to its Street View cars.
“We designed our cities without data,” Aclima founder Davida Herzl tells me. Literally piggybacking on Google could let Aclima produce the data necessary to make urban areas easier on the lungs.
Testing the Aclima sensor
In the first pilot, three Street View cars collected 150 million air quality data points over a month of driving around Denver, Colo. They measured for chemicals that are hazardous to breathe, like nitrogen dioxide, nitric oxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, black carbon, particulate matter, and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs).
The goal is to make data like this available to citizens so they and their local governments can see pollution on their own streets.

Independent scientific analysis confirmed that the mobile sensor system worked for collecting street-by-street data and could improve upon the regional network of sensors operated by the Environmental Protection Agency. Herzl says “we hope that one day this information is as accessible as the weather.” Here’s a video on how the program works:

Google has now agreed to purchase more of Aclima’s outdoor sensors for a bigger rollout to map air quality. Aclima-equipped Street View cars will criss-cross the Bay Area and other cities this year as part of the next big data collection.
The bootstrapped Aclima came out of stealth last month, detailing how it designs and builds its own sensors, manages the network as they collect data, processes the data on its cloud backend, and produces analytics and visualizations.

The first project it announced was using indoor sensors to help Google measure air quality in its offices to optimize productivity.
For example, by tracking conference rooms throughout the day, Google could determine if CO2 levels climbed high enough to degrade brain function. If you’ve ever felt suffocated in a cramped meeting, you’re not crazy. With productivity of its huge elite workforce translating into billions in earned or lost revenue for Google, it has plenty of incentive to join up with Aclima.
For now, its Street View partnership is more charitable. Google Earth Outreach will help organizations use the data to visualize air-quality problems in cities, which could help them make arguments for fixes to city planners.
Herzl explains that “We know that trees absorb pollution, NO2 specifically. If we can know where pollution hotspots are, we can know where to put green spaces.” The Google partnership will allow it to rapidly scale the deployment of its sensors. This way, Aclima can pursue its mission to make a business out of improving human health through environmental protection.

There’s plenty more Google could potentially do with the data, though. It could allow Google Maps to route cars or pedestrians away from high-pollution areas to avoid exacerbating condensed pollution or breathing it in.
The ability to direct self-driving cars away from intersections where they might contribute to high-pollution zones could help convince cities they’re a positive change. I’ve asked Google for a comment on these possibilities and am waiting to hear back.
Herzl concludes that Aclima’s sensors are producing social good out of the Internet Of Things, which is often thought of as just equipping homes with Wi-Fi-connected appliances. She tells me, “There’s a whole new world of opportunities to make our cities healthier, not just smarter.”

384,Uber Is Now Testing “Suggested Pickup Points”,https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/08/uber-suggested-pickup-points/,2015/07/08,"
Uber is going to tell you where you should get picked up. A few days after I wrote a story recommending that Uber launch a feature called “Suggested Pickup Location”, I’ve spotted the company testing a feature called “Suggested Pickup Points” in San Francisco.
[Update: Uber confirms this feature began testing yesterday, telling me “Our product team is always working on new features to make riding with Uber an even more seamless experience for both riders and drivers. The “Suggested Pickup Points” feature –– now in experiment-only phase and available to a small percentage of users in San Francisco ––  is part of these ongoing efforts.]
When dragging the pickup pin, the feature explains that passengers can “save time at these locations”, and shows places nearby where it would quicker for the driver to pick them up. Users can drop their pin on these green dots, see the address, and then walk there to shorten their wait time.
Only some users are seeing the test, though it’s appeared on iOS for uberPool, uberX, and Uber Black Car. I’ve reached out to the company for more info and will update when we hear back. Though an Uber employee has said the company can crank out updates, a feature like this probably takes more than a few days to build. Still, apparently we agree there’s a lot of merit to this idea.
The suggestions pop up extremely quickly as you drag your pin around, which makes it feel satisfying rather that annoying. The design seems intuitive enough not to baffle users, even if Uber extends it to less smartphone-savvy locales.

Uber appears to using past pickup data to power suggestions for where drivers can pull over most easily. By referencing where drivers have tended to stop in the past, it seems to have compiled a map of where there’s space for cars to retrieve humans.
For example, at the San Francisco Giants’ AT&T ballpark above, Uber suggests people head to one of the corners outside, rather than in the middle of the block where traffic rushes and there’s nowhere to pull over. If you’re in an one-way alleyway, Uber recommends you head out to the next main street. It’s an impressive merging of big data crunching and product design.
As I wrote in my article on Sunday, shaving time off the wait between when a passenger hails and a driver arrives to the pickup point has benefits for everyone:

Drivers waste less time and gas going to scoop up their fares, so they save money and can do more rides per hour on the job
Drivers avoid the stress of being honked at for stopping in the middle of the street where there’s nowhere to pull over
Bicyclists and other motorists don’t have to navigate around drivers waiting in the street
Car services can offer shorter pickup ETAs, making them more convenient and appealing to customers
Car services can boost their available car supply with the same number of drivers since getting started in the right direction makes routes take less time to run
Car services have more flexibility in increasing their tax since drivers naturally take home more money because they’re running more rides on less gas
Car services earn more money since mandatory minimum fees mean they typically make more money the more total rides they carry
Passengers get from hail to destination faster
Passengers pay less since they don’t take inefficient routes due to being picked up going the wrong direction

When my friend was shown the Suggested Pickup Points tonight, Uber didn’t take into account his destination. If it did, it could factor in which direction the car would want to be pointed to speed up the ride. It didn’t show any suggestions when given an exact pickup address, so for now it seems intended for people who are starting from their GPS dot.
In this test, users weren’t offered any discount or other incentive to use the Pickup Points beyond saving some time. That distinguishes it from Lyft Line’s HotSpots, which are effectively discounted bus stops for its carpools.
Eventually, Uber could use Suggested Pickup Points to prevent causing its own traffic jams in front of popular venues. It could also help Uber infiltrate places like Las Vegas where its banned. Big hotels like those in Sin City are understandably worried about pedestrians wandering away from designated taxi loops and into traffic trying to find their Ubers. Pickup Points could instill order.
At its heart, Uber is about saving people time. With Suggested Pickup Points, it’s found a way to earn more money by letting users save themselves.

385,Environmental Sensor Startup Aclima Is Studying The Air Googlers Breathe,https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/30/googleair/,2015/06/30,"
Do Google employees breathe better air than the rest of us? That’s what San Francisco-based environmental health startup Aclima wants to know.
Aclima stayed hush about what it’s been up to for the last several years, but just announced it has been studying the indoor air quality on Google’s Mountain View campus and several other Google buildings throughout the world for the last several years.
The startup also announced partnerships with the Environmental Protection Agency and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to find out how the air around us affects our health.
Aclima uses a network of strategically placed sensors within building structures to monitor and analyze the air that we breathe. These sensors then send information to backend software that can update air quality information in real-time.

Each sensor can be customized to do things like map greenhouse gasses across a city or measure how much particulate matter is inside a building.
Environmental sensor networks have largely stayed within academia. However, Smart Citizens has a vast distribution of open-sourced environmental sensors placed all over the world – mostly in North America and Europe – that are programmed using Arduino-compatible hardware and a smartphone app to monitor the environmental quality.
Smart Citizens is more of a project for the people. Aclima is intended for large enterprises and government institutions.
The startup deployed a global indoor environmental sensor network of 500 devices across 21 Google offices around the world several years back, enabling the startup to process more than half a billion indoor air quality data points such as carbon dioxide emissions and particulate matter that affect Googlers’ lungs on a daily basis. 
Google is known for offering perks like massages, on-campus laundry, and free food. It’s also the home of out-there projects centering on life-extension and other health-related queries. It seems a natural fit for testing environmental air quality, too.
Bringing a small­ scale sensor of this type to market will help us to effectively measure particle pollution, which has been linked to a wide range of serious health problems.— Lara Gundel, Berkeley Lab“We strive to create the healthiest and best possible work environments for Googlers. Our vision is to create buildings that seamlessly support the people who inhabit them. Using Aclima’s science­driven sensor networks to map our indoor environmental quality is a big part of making that happen,” Google’s Real Estate and Workplace Services executive Anthony Ravitz said in a statement.
Google, with its vast, global office network, is also a good place to study the effects of climate change. “There’s actually a scarcity of measurement,” Aclima co-founder Davida Herzl told TechCrunch. “And that data can drive change in entirely new ways.”
Measuring those local patterns in the atmosphere can lead to discoveries about human health in surrounding environments. The E.P.A. and Berkeley Lab are keen to work with Aclima to pinpoint how emissions affect public health such as asthma and breathing issues.

“Bringing a small­ scale sensor of this type to market will help us to effectively measure particle pollution, which has been linked to a wide range of serious health problems,” Berkeley Lab’s Dr. Lara Gundel said.
Lung health can also be affected by a work environment that is closer to heavy traffic or even building management practices. Knowing how what we breathe affects our long-term health can help us make changes for the better in our environment.
“There is absolutely an influence. Buildings are not just these static containers. They live in systems, and these systems are our cities,” Herzl said. “Aclima is working to make this invisible connection visible, on a grand scale and across industries.”

386,Teach Kids Tech And Life With A Pi-Powered DIY Camera Trap,https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/26/teach-kids-tech-and-life-with-a-pi-powered-diy-camera-trap/,2015/06/26,"
There’s no shortage of products purporting to help teach kids coding these days, whether it’s Kano’s DIY computer kit, or the Robot Turtles board game, or any one of the many programmable robots. Toys with a STEM twist that aim to keep kids tinkering and learning indoors are all the rage.
U.K. startup Naturebytes is bringing a different emphasis to this tech-plus-education space. It’s aiming to combine hackable technology with a mission to spark kids’ curiosity in the great outdoors. And given kids’ dictionaries have this year been jettisoning nature-related words such as acorn and buttercup, and adding in tech terms like broadband and ‘cut and paste’, there are perhaps signs technology risks becoming a little all consuming for ‘digital natives’.
Naturebytes has just kicked off a Kickstarter for a Raspberry Pi-powered camera trap kit for capturing wildlife photos. The idea is to inspire kids about what electronics and coding can do while also giving them an appetite for learning about and experiencing nature. Putting technology outdoors might also be a way to get kids interested who might otherwise prefer running around outdoors. Add to that, embedding technology in the natural environment is something we’re going to see more of, with the rise of the Internet of Things.
The weatherproof camera trap kit is designed to survive the elements. It houses a Raspberry Pi Model A microprocessor (other more powerful Pis can also be used), battery pack, Pi cam and an infrared sensor — a set up that enables motion-sensitive photo (and video) capture of any passing wildlife. The camera comes in kit form so kids get to put it all together and learn along the way. There’s also scope for expanding functionality — for instance the kit can be upgraded with a Wi-Fi link to automatically upload wildlife snaps.
As well as crowdfunding these hardware kits, Naturebytes is intending to build a web platform where users can share images they’ve captured with the camera, and get involved with citizen science projects. Kits start at £45 for more advanced makers who already have a Pi and Pi cam and want to 3D print the camera casing themselves. Stepping up to £85 for a kit that has everything except the Pi included, or £95 for all the bits and bobs.
At the time of writing the team has raised more than 10 per cent of their crowdfunding target, with a month left on their campaign clock. So not bad going. They’re targeting around $45,000 in total pledges in order to produce and ship their first batch of kits — with an estimated shipping schedule of December.

Tamin Pechet is the founder of Banyan Water and founder and chairman of Imagine H2O.


California Governor Jerry Brown recently imposed mandatory water restrictions to combat severe drought that “demands unprecedented action.” Many investors have grown familiar with the global trends changing in the way water is supplied, transported, treated and used. Those mega-trends, however, have not translated into much action from the venture community.
The current drought in California has renewed focus on the Silicon Valley’s role in providing new solutions. The good news is that the commercial market for water solutions is bigger than you might think, and that venture-stage companies in water perform better than many investors and entrepreneurs realize.
Where Is The Silicon Valley For Water?
Just a few hours drive from Sand Hill Road, California’s major agricultural production areas require heavy water use to sustain production. Water wells serving hundreds of families in the Central Valley have run dry, leaving people without water flowing from their taps.
Yet the Silicon Valley for water remains in formation. Water and wastewater companies receive only a few hundred million dollars of investment annually — about 1 percent of angel and venture capital. That percentage has remained relatively constant in recent years, despite increasing attention to water needs.
An ongoing debate simmers over whether water represents an attractive investment area for the Silicon Valley. Proponents say water is the next oil. Naysayers cite challenges to hyper sales growth for innovative water products and services. A recent New York Times article noted that “the water crisis simply may be a poor match for the Valley’s skill set.”
Water startups have performed better than many tech startup peers.
This article won’t settle the debate. There has been no Facebook or Google of Water, and perhaps there never will be. On the other hand, water industry segments differ wildly. It might prove hard for a water startup to achieve hockey stick growth if it sells, say engineering construction services for dams. The hockey stick might be realistic, however, for a startup selling data analytics on water to oil and gas customers.
In a large and changing market, water startups have performed better than many tech startup peers. Let’s take a look at some surprising data and some promising companies.
The Big Business Of Water
You might think of water as a public service. Although your town may still supply your water and sewer service, the business of water is big industry. The annual revenues for water industry products and services exceed $600 billion.
Moreover, increasing pressure on our water systems means the products, services and methods on which we have relied for decades now will not suffice. Demand for innovation has arisen from dwindling supply and increasing demand, flooding, rising costs of infrastructure, energy and chemicals, the sustainability movement and more.
The Surprising Performance Of Water Startups
How do water startups fare versus startups in other industries? It turns out water startups have been high performers. Lux Research (disclosure: I am a board member) provides intelligence on a range of emerging technologies and companies in science-based markets, and offers a unique comparison data set.
Lux’s research team compared the time to profitability for water startups against a set of 3,700 startups that they have analyzed closely across electronics, energy, agriculture, nutrition, life sciences and infrastructure. Those 3,700 startups offer a range of solutions, from materials to devices, IT and services.
At five years, 14 percent of water startups reached profitability, slightly lagging the 17 percent overall average. But at the 10-year check-in, 31 percent of water startups were profitable compared to a 26 percent average. By year 15, 50 percent of water startups were profitable, beating the 42 percent average.
Another cut at the data suggests strong performance over the past five years. Lux provides an overall rating for each of the companies it analyzes. Twenty-two water startups earned a positive rating in 2009 (a start year that allows a five-year look back). Those 22 companies yielded one failure, two acquisitions and eight startups that reached profitability. The remaining 11 companies have averaged more than 300 percent growth since 2009.
What does that data really mean? At a minimum, it suggests there are plenty of good businesses among water startups.
What Water Entrepreneurs Are Saying
CEOs of water startups believe not only in their own prospects, but in the prospects of their industry peers. Imagine H2O is an accelerator program for water businesses and has accepted 60 companies out of more than 450 applicants. More than 20 of our CEOs answered a survey for this article. They would, almost universally, invest in water startups other than their own.
There are many investment opportunities in the water innovation sector. Imagine H2O’s portfolio accounts for more than $1 in $10 of angel and venture investment in water. And most of our portfolio companies plan to raise capital within the next six months. There are plenty of opportunities for strategic investors and venture firms to put money in the water sector.
There is little competition to finance water startups compared to other industries. There are only a handful of investment firms that specialize solely in water. Most Silicon Valley investors do not focus on the industry. And Imagine H2O’s companies report that over the past few years, they have felt little change in competition among venture and angel investors to get into water deals.
Water startups have performed well despite minimal regulatory support. Now, regulatory trends are in their favor. The low price of water creates a common concern among would-be water investors. Interestingly, water and wastewater rates are rising across America, generally faster than any other utilities.
From drought to flood, pipes to pumps, agriculture to industry, the water market needs innovation more than ever.
In some customer applications, water is far more expensive than energy. Nevertheless, water is generally cheap. Federal, state and local governments within the U.S. have offered minimal support or incentives to encourage the adoption of new water innovations. That also means that water startups have achieved strong performance by navigating a historically unsupportive regulatory environment.
Companies that address water scarcity, not surprisingly, believe that the current California drought has made selling and financing much easier. If you believe regulation and trends will support water startups, then their performance should only improve.
Companies With Recent Venture Financing And Promising Solutions
Let’s take a look at a few venture-financed companies unleashing solutions with potential to address the world’s increasing water needs.
Software and Analytics
Smart solutions to the drought require helping major urban customers, since about half of a city water system lies on private property. Most large water users lack the data to manage their use and protect their properties against leaks, which cause roughly $10 billion a year in private property damage. Banyan Water serves enterprise customers across the country, such as Blackstone’s real estate portfolio, with cloud-based software to perform analytics on water and sewer bills, identifying savings opportunities.
The company’s software then syncs with meters and controllers on customer’s property to remotely control outdoor irrigation use and monitor flow through pipes into a building. The impact has been more than 50 percent water savings, and ongoing, real-time leak detection. Investors include Cue Ball Capital and Catamount Ventures.
Have you looked at your home water bill lately? Did it make sense to you? If so, your local utility might use WaterSmart Software, an oPower for water that helps peer-benchmark residential water use to encourage conservation, and helps utilities like East Bay Municipal Utility District, which serves Oakland and the surrounding area, better engage with their residential customers. WaterSmart recently raised $7 million at a $21 million pre-money valuation.
In a drought, water utilities face pressure to encourage conservation from their customers. But most utilities’ revenues equal the price of water service times the volume of water sold. Predicting the impact of conservation and rate changes turns out to be a tricky data problem. Valor Water Analytics sells software to help utilities make better financial decisions, has landed multiple utility contracts (including Sonoma County) in its first months as a live commercial entity and is Y Combinator backed.
In any discussion about urban water management, the utility is the elephant in the room. Fathom sells a managed service to help water utilities, including the city of Menlo Park, link meters, billing systems and other data sources to intelligently run the water utility grid. Originally a spin-out of an investor-owned utility company, the solution was developed by a utility for a utility. Fathom’s investors include XPV Capital and Silver Lake Kraftwerk, and the company notes a 10 percent water conservation impact among its client benefits.
Water Treatment
Kurion provides a fascinating example of Silicon Valley innovation helping to address a major water crisis. The company’s technologies, which include removal of hazards from wastewater streams, were deployed at Fukushima after the nuclear disaster. Kurion’s solutions removed more than 70 percent of the radioactivity from the water. Kurion’s investors include Lux Capital and Firelake Capital, and the company has generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue since its founding in 2008.
Desalitech has also attracted venture investment with novel water treatment technology. The company innovated on the widely used reverse osmosis treatment methodology. Its proprietary closed-circuit process design and engineering cuts the water wasted in reverse osmosis treatment by half or more, and reduces energy used in treatment by about one-third.
It offers customers a typical payback within a year, and sells mostly to large industrials, including Coca Cola. Desalitech raised $11 million in December, 2014, led by Spring Creek and Liberation Capital.
Reuse and Recycling
Countries that have learned to cope with water scarcity, like Israel, reuse the majority of their water. In America, just a tiny fraction of our water is recycled. In fact, we use water that is treated to drinking quality standards for almost every application.
Nexus eWater, born in Australia’s drought-stricken environment, provides an onsite treatment solution for homes to reuse wastewater for outdoor irrigation and flushing toilets. Nexus eWater has played a major role in influencing California water policy to enable onsite residential reuse. The company recently closed a $2.1 million Series A, and was featured in KB Homes’ annual report as a solutions partner.
Energy
Research from the California Energy Commission found that about 20 percent of the state’s electricity is used to transport and treat water and wastewater. Natel Energy’s solutions allow hydropower generation in small water conduits using novel turbine technology. Historically, hydropower systems have required a high vertical drop in water flow to generate power efficiently. Natel’s solutions open a range of new installation opportunities by working with lower vertical drops.
The company’s customers include Apple, which recently partnered with Natel to develop hydropower in an existing irrigation canal in Oregon. Natel recently closed a $7 million Series B.
Agriculture
Agriculture uses about 80 percent of California’s water. Over the past decade, a wave of venture-backed companies developed sensors and software to improve farm irrigation. That group of companies, including venture-backed Puresense and Aquaspy, developed novel soil-moisture monitoring technology, helping farmers increase crop yield per drop of water used.
Yet, despite generating good results for farmers, results for investors seeking big returns have been mixed thus far. The struggle to achieve hockey-stick growth stemmed, in part, from the difficulty of penetrating a fragmented agricultural customer base.
The recent success of a new group of companies offering business intelligence to farms might just lead to a rising tide for water innovation in agriculture. One example, Farmlogs, a Y Combinator alum that recently raised a $10 million Series B. The company includes data related to water for farms in its business intelligence software, but its software focuses on a broader set of farm decisions that include water use.
The promise, from a water perspective, comes from the recent ability demonstrated by Farmlogs and other farm data startups to penetrate the market.
The company, just a few years old, claims 15 percent of America’s 2.1 million farms use its service. A data dashboard to so many customers offers the potential to better manage water. It also offers a signal that other Silicon Valley water startups can achieve rapid penetration of the agricultural market, either independently or in partnership with companies like Farmlogs.
From drought to flood, pipes to pumps, agriculture to industry, the water market needs innovation more than ever. These companies represent a new wave of water startups that show the promise of commercial success and a safer water future.

388,"Gogoro Reveals Its Upcoming Electric Smartscooters Will Cost From $4,100",https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/17/gogoro-is-almost-gogo/,2015/06/17,"
Gogoro, the Taiwan-based startup that raised $150 million in stealth mode before unveiling its flagship electric scooter, has finally revealed how much the vehicles will cost.
In a press conference today, co-founder Horace Luke (HTC’s former chief innovation officer), said that a Smartscooter will cost NTD$128,000 (about $4,140) to pre-order in Taiwan, where Gogoro is currently running a pilot program with support from Taipei City and neighboring New Taipei City.
As Luke pointed out, this is more than a 125cc gas scooter that costs NTD $81,000, or $2,620 (a relatively high-end price bracket). When government subsidies for electric vehicles and the cost-savings of using Gogoro’s batteries instead of gas are considered, however, the company claims that overall cost of owning a Smartscooter will be less than its gas counterpart after two years of use.

Gogoro hasn’t said yet which countries it plans to expand to after Taiwan, but most of its inquiries have come from India, China, Brazil, and Thailand, where gas scooters are popular modes of transportation.
If it does expand to those markets, Gogoro will go up against other electric scooter makers like HERO in India, which sells models for as low as $300. Gogoro differentiates with an extremely easy to use battery-swapping system and an app that lets Smartscooter owners monitor the performance of their vehicles, but it remains to be seen if customers are willing to pay a higher upfront cost or if the company will be able to build the necessary charging infrastructure in other cities.

389,SpaceX Is Hosting A Hyperloop Pod Competition And Will Build A Test Track,https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/15/spacex-is-hosting-a-hyperloop-pod-competition-and-will-build-a-test-track/,2015/06/15,"
SpaceX isn’t building a Hyperloop, the sci-fi transportation system that would use low-pressure, miles long tube track to essentially shoot transit pods between destinations at super-fast speeds. But it is encouraging others to build it, and today announced a design competition wherein others can submit their own ideas for the passenger-carrying pods themselves.
The Pod competition is open to anyone, and is geared towards university students and independent engineering teams. The competition is open until September 15, 2015, at which point submissions will be vetted by the company, and SpaceX hopes to build the one-mile test track near its Hawthorne, CA HQ by June of next year, at which time SpaceX hopes to host a head-to-head competition of pods from submissions built to human scale.
SpaceX still makes sure to distance itself from any control or ownership over eventual Hyperloop commercial production plans, but with this completion, they’re definitely encouraging it to actually become a reality.


SpaceX/Tesla will also do a reference pod to be shown after the @Hyperloop competition. Bonus for all racing teams that exceed reference.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 15, 2015



Elon Musk, SpaceX CEO and founder, has also announced that the company will create its own reference Hyperloop Pod, but that it will remain shrouded until after the various entrants race their own versions on the test track.

390,Google’s New Sidewalk Labs Project Will Use Tech To Improve Life In Urban Areas,https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/11/sidewalk-labs-urban-living-moon-shot-from-google/,2015/06/11,"
Google is best known for internet search and services but the company also runs a host of other projects that use technology to solve other kinds of problems. The latest of these — known as ‘moon shots’ — is Sidewalk Labs, a company dedicated to improving life in cities and urban areas.
Led by former Bloomberg CEO Dan Doctoroff, New York-based Sidewalk Labs is focused on tackling issues like cost of living, transportation, energy usage and more.
“New technologies are already transforming commerce, media and access to information. However, while there are apps to tell people about traffic conditions, or the prices of available apartments, the biggest challenges that cities face — such as making transportation more efficient and lowering the cost of living, reducing energy usage and helping government operate more efficiently have, so far, been more difficult to address,” the company said in an announcement.
Google CEO Larry Page said that the company’s investment in Sidewalk Labs is relatively modest, but he is optimistic that it can address urban living issues in a more rounded way.
“Every time I talk with Dan I feel an amazing sense of opportunity because of all the ways technology can help transform cities to be more livable, flexible and vibrant,” Page said in a Google+ post. “It’s an area where I hope we can really improve people’s lives, similar to Google[x] and [healthcare-focused] Calico.”
At this point it isn’t entirely clear how Sidewalk Labs will operate or exactly what kind of technology it will produce. Doctoroff — formerly Deputy Mayor of Economic Development and Rebuilding for the City of New York — said only that it “will play a major role in developing technology products, platforms and advanced infrastructure that can be implemented at scale in cities around the world.”

391,Urban Transportation Will Go All-Electric Sooner Than You Think,https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/29/urban-transportation-will-go-all-electric-sooner-than-you-think/,2015/05/29,"
Editor’s note: Michael Linse and Zach Barasz are investors with the Green Growth Fund at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.
Think of the vehicle that will change urban transportation. If the image in your mind is not an electric bus, you’re thinking of the wrong vehicle.
The electrification of the passenger vehicle has made headlines for good reason. Vehicles like the Tesla Model S and BMW i8 are beautiful and fast, and cars like the Chevy Volt and Nissan Leaf offer compelling value to commuters. But we’d be lucky if plug-in vehicles represent more than 5 percent of passenger vehicles sold in the United States over the next five years. Worries about range and cost are real, and it will take time to undertake the public effort – and build the charging infrastructure – to address consumer concerns.
Yet in other parts of the transportation industry, the electric drivetrain will experience much more rapid adoption. The most unexpected, and most impactful, shift will be for the mass transit bus.  
A Bus Is the Perfect Use Case for an Electric Drivetrain
The electric drivetrain does a few things much better than a combustion engine. Electric motors have very high torque – buses are heavy, so they require high torque to accelerate. Electric motors can also deliver that torque at low speeds – buses stop and start often, so they require that power at low speeds. And batteries can recover energy from all of that braking.
As a result, an electric bus uses 20 percent of the raw energy of a diesel bus to go the same distance. In MPGe terms, a typical diesel bus may get 3.9 MPG – whereas an electric bus would get 21.4 MPGe. An electric drivetrain is also easier to take care of than an engine with controlled fuel explosions, more moving parts, filters and fluids.
The net result is that the total lifetime cost to own and operate an electric bus is 35 percent lower than that of a diesel bus. In five years, as battery and other costs come down, that advantage will only increase.
If you could buy a Tesla for less than an equivalent product and simultaneously save well over 50 percent on operating costs, the purchase decision would probably be quite easy. That is the kind of decision that transit operators will face in 2020.
Batteries Are Cheap in the Context of a Bus
Battery cost is a key barrier to adoption of electric vehicles, whether in a car or in a bus. However, a transit bus travels 3.5x more miles per year and carries 6x more passengers than a car, on average, so the battery cost is spread over 20x more “passenger miles” in a bus versus a car. Net, the real cost of the battery is multiples cheaper in a bus than a car, suggesting that the transit industry will shift toward electric vehicles before passenger cars.
Furthermore, batteries keep dropping in price. In 2015, price per kWh of automotive lithium-ion batteries was 60 percent lower than in 2010. In another five years, prices will likely drop by a similar percentage. Some analysts project that Tesla’s Gigafactory will drive so much volume that costs for batteries could decline by over 80 percent. And new technologies may completely transform the cost curve. All of this means that the case for electric buses will become more and more compelling over time.
But why do buses matter? Won’t everyone be taking Uber in the future anyway? 
Public Transit Is a Killer App in People Moving 

A public transit system is the cheapest way, per mile, to get from A to B. No matter how many miles you drive per year, if public transit is an option, it is cheaper than owning a car, car-sharing, or ridesharing.
Within public transportation, buses are extraordinarily efficient versus other options. The New York Times recently noted how much money governments spend on light rail as opposed to improving and marketing existing bus systems. A transit bus line is much cheaper than light rail to build, and offers unparalleled flexibility. Add electric to the mix, and that transit bus line is also half as expensive to run.
The Environmental Case
In addition to making immense financial sense, the transition to EV bus transit is important for urban environments. Even after taking into account the emissions from the electricity generation, an electric bus emits 4-6x fewer greenhouse gases than a bus that runs on diesel or natural gas. As solar and other renewables continue to increase as a percent of energy produced, the greenhouse gas emissions from electric vehicles will continue to fall.
Improves Transportation Today, and Solves Problems of Tomorrow
Most cities were designed when less than a third of the population lived in urban areas. Today, over half of humanity lives in cities, and that will grow to two-thirds by 2050. Reliance on the passenger car has created substantial costs from congestion. In the U.S. alone, congestion cost the economy $124 billion in 2013, or 0.7 percent of GDP – two Googles in revenue. We will need multiple solutions for addressing this congestion, including car sharing and ridesharing, but the electric bus is the killer solution for the modern city.
New entrants to the bus industry, including Bay Area-based Proterra (disclosure: Michael Linse is Chairman of Proterra) and the Chinese battery maker BYD, as well as incumbents such as New Flyer and Volvo, are understanding the transformative impact of the electric bus.
By 2020, we expect a majority of transit buses sold in the U.S. to be electric, and we expect the availability of highly efficient, low cost, zero emissions, and quiet electric buses to lead to a renaissance of urban transit in the United States.

392,"Speakers At The Europas Conference And Awards Reflect Europe’s Diversity, June 16, London",https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/27/speakers-at-the-europas-2015/,2015/05/27,"
The Europas Conference & Awards for European Tech Startups, on June 16 in London, is an annual celebration of Europe’s brightest tech companies. From a small bar in central London in 2009, it’s become a fixture of the European scene, with its highly curated daytime speakers and audience, which combines the key startup players in Europe, as well as the hottest newcomers, together with a fantastic awards bash. Think ‘The Crunchies’ plus a small, cool conference with a lot more Europeans.
TechCrunch is the exclusive media sponsor for The Europas, and attendees will automatically receive deep discounts on Disrupt Europe tickets among other perks. Tickets to the daytime conference are limited, but you can grab the last ones here, or here for the evening awards only.
The Europas celebrate some of the most forward-thinking and innovative European tech companies across some 20-plus categories. Over the last few weeks startups have been able to either apply for an award or be nominated by a third party. A judging panel then selected a shortlist of nominees, which was submitted to public voting. Finally those results were combined. Previous Europas winners have included Supercell, Layar, Podio, BlaBlaCar, SoundCloud, Seedcamp, Socialbakers, Mind Candy and King.com. The voting has now taken place, the feedback collated, the shortlist is out, and the winners will be announced at the end of the conference in a fun awards ceremony. Prior to the finale, The Europas “unconference” of invited guests, features relaxed networking and small group discussion sessions.
This year, The Europas is adding a parallel event, PathFounders (June 15th-17th), designed to bring early-stage founders together with investors. PathFounders will bring a select group of 100 of Europe’s early-stage founders, VCs and angel investors. Eligible daytime conference ticket holders will receive an invite to upgrade their ticket to include this. Email TheEuropas@gmail.com for details.

393,Goldman Sachs Is Our Best Bet Against Climate Change,https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/26/goldman-sachs-is-our-best-bet-against-climate-change/,2015/05/26,"




Bryan Birsic
Contributor



Bryan Birsic is the CEO and co-founder of Wunder Capital


Although it may not be the obvious hero, usually more Vampire Squid than White Knight, Goldman Sachs and its cohorts could be responsible for transitioning the renewables sector from a fragmented and esoteric industry to one of mainstream dominance. It’s facilitated the development of world-encompassing industries before and they will do it again.
In its 2014 Annual Report, Goldman compares the potential of the renewables market to that of the Internet, “Mass market adoption of any new, disruptive industry often takes a path of early enthusiasm followed by market rejection, volatility and ultimately, acceptance. This was true of the Internet, and evidence suggests a similar course when it comes to clean technology and renewable energy.”
The information revolution saw us move from only 1 percent of the world’s information communicated online in 1993 to 97 percent by 2007. In comparison, the U.S. Department of Energy’s goal to increase solar energy output from 1 percent to 10 percent by 2025 is modest, and yet would dramatically grow the renewables industry.
Behind this growth are Goldman Sachs, Citi, JPMorgan and the rest of the institutional investment industry, moving increasing volumes of capital into this market as it matures and sheds risk. The capital markets are one of the most powerful forces humanity has created, and while occasionally (ok, often) it can go rogue, harnessing its power is the only realistic way renewable energy will receive the investment capital needed to scale and have the impact we need.
Flying less, recycling more, and being better to the planet are things we should all do; affordable renewable energy solutions and high-tech innovations are things we all have. But it’s clear these aren’t enough to change the course on which we find ourselves. Large amounts of capital are needed to advance renewable energy from fringe to dominance, which only the financial industry can deploy. Thirty years of technological advances provided the kindling, but it’s capital market gasoline that will really get things going.
Right now there are (metaphorical) thick clouds of smoke billowing from the financial sector. Goldman Sachs is investing $40 billion in renewables by 2021. Citi has committed $100 billion to the facilitation of clean energy by 2025, and Berkshire Hathaway is investing $15 billion into solar and wind projects at Warren Buffet’s personal behest. Within investment banks, new groups have been created to focus on clean energy development and businesses, such as Morgan Stanley’s Institute for Sustainable Investing and JPMorgan’s Environmental and Social Risk Management division.
These decisions weren’t made because they are the right things to do (although they are), but because they make economic sense. Renewables must deliver strong returns first, and the double bottom line impact of benefiting the environment second. This may seem calculated but tapping capital markets is absolutely crucial to the health of the planet. Investing in clean energy is a smart decision — not just a personal passion — and that’s what will allow renewables to achieve global scale.
To date, capital markets are igniting growth in renewables by reducing capital costs, investing in better ideas, and
Reducing capital costs
Third-party financing plays an important role in the capital markets, as one person’s loan is another person’s income. Providing affordable financing to cover any upfront clean energy adoption costs is one of the easiest ways to drive change at the consumer level. The P2P lending space is booming with online alternative lenders, such as Lending Club, Prosper and Fundera, and the model has taken off in the renewables sector.
SunFunder and SparkFund are tackling renewable energy financing issues in emerging-market solar and energy efficiency, respectively. Reducing capital costs for individuals and small businesses creates a virtuous cycle: cheap capital expand the customer pool, which increases product demand, and that allows manufacturers to offer cheaper and cheaper panels, expanding the customer pool even more.
The fuel of this virtuous cycle is capital, and the combination of flexible online solar lenders and institutional capital will amply provide for future growth.
Investing in Good Ideas
The renewables industry wouldn’t be as advanced as it is today if not for the billions of investment dollars poured into it. In 2014 global investment in clean energy reached $310 billion. Cleantech firms raised over $18.7 billion and venture capital and private equity investment in the industry reached $4.8 billion. Early investment in firms such as SolarCity, Enphase and Clean Power Finance accelerated the growth of solar by at least five years, transforming it to be today’s compelling power source.
The energy industry is one of America’s oldest, and, as is happening in the fintech space, is being challenged by new market entrants who are using apps, the web, and SaaS products to make things faster, better and smarter.
From better underwriting models to greater control over home efficiency, such as Nest, funneling investor capital toward good ideas that are bringing renewables to scale is increasing the industry’s size, influence and accessibility dramatically.
Financial Innovation
It used to be that only the largest of financial institutions could invest in renewables, but new products are providing access across nearly every asset class. Over the past few years the introduction of green bonds, YieldCos and clean energy index funds, while still early, show promising initial returns, indicating the market has appetite for “green-backed” financial products. This contradicts the false assumptions that investing in the environment and investing for returns cannot co-exist.
Today’s products are just the tip of the iceberg. Solutions emerging include more ways to repackage debt such as renewable-backed securitized products or energy mezzanine financing, and financing constructs that generate revenue based on projected savings, such as social impact bonds.
As Michael Eckhart, Managing Director and Global Head of Finance and Sustainability at Citi said in an interview with Clean Energy Finance Forum, “I think we are 40 years into a 100-year transition to a clean finance economy. The momentum is going in our favor and we are succeeding.”
Like the tech industry, the renewables market has waxed and waned, but the constantly decreasing cost of technology drives both forward. As hardware costs continue to decrease and renewable equipment becomes more commonplace, software-based firms will build better mousetraps and bring new solutions to old problems.
Underlying all this will be an infrastructure of capital flowing from one entity to the next, responsible for thousands (probably millions) of jobs and billions in global economic growth.
If Internet-like growth is to be achieved, then we have reason to be optimistic about the future of our environment. Right now we may be at the stage with renewables of reading articles explaining what “www” means and why you can’t use a landline phone and the Internet at the same time.
But it also means that across the country you have the renewable energy versions of Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Larry Page working in garages, developing innovative products we didn’t know we needed until they change the world. However, this time, there is one key difference: As markets mature, investments are made, and returns are reaped, not only Goldman Sachs profits. We all do.

Pavegen is on a mission to upgrade the ground you walk on. The U.K. clean-tech startup has engineered a high tech flooring product that can generate enough energy to power lights and even buildings by harnessing kinetic energy from pedestrians walking on it.
The surface is also sensitive to where people are walking, and how many pedestrians are in a given area, so the company is hoping to create a data-analytics software business to go with its high tech underfoot hardware — hardware which could, for instance, tell subway travelers where to stand on a platform to get into the least busy carriage before the train arrives.
Pavegen’s current flooring product can be used indoors or outdoors in high traffic areas, and generates electricity from pedestrian footfall using an electromagnetic induction process. The technology is patented and the company has just done its hundredth installation, according to founder and CEO Laurence Kemball-Cook.
Today it’s launching a campaign on Crowdcube with the aim of raising £750,000 or more to keep scaling a business that has been beavering away for several years, with plans to ramp up its headcount and operations.
“We’re sitting right at the middle of the hardware space. I started the idea as a sketch. I guess we’re creating an industry. We had no blueprints or market to follow — we had to create it, so… there was a lot of figuring out to do and core engineering behind the product,” Kemball-Cook tells TechCrunch. “We’ve had to figure out each market and make it fit for that. It was a tremendous challenge.”
“Right now today we’ve got a team of 25 in the U.K. We’ve got operations set up in nine different regions in the world… And we’ve deployed [Pavegen] in 30 countries so we’ve got a bit of scale already.”
The product is best suited to transport hubs where a large flow of people will pass over it. The largest deployment the company has done so far is in a (non-standard sized) football pitch in a Favela in Rio de Janiro to help power the floodlights around the pitch. Other installations include in Federation Square in Melbourne, Australia, and at London’s Heathrow airport. It’s also today put up a temporary installation outside London’s Canary Wharf station powering two streetlights with the aim of raising awareness about the technology and its crowdfunding campaign.

Pavegen was founded back in 2009, beginning as a concept bootstrapped by Kemball-Cook in his bedroom before he took in a friends and family round of around £100,000 in late 2010. That was followed by a £450,000 seed in 2012. The startup has been generating revenue since then — taking in more than £2.5 million in total to date — and was even profitable in 2013. But now plans to expand operations and headcount to scale the business to meet demand for its energy-generating tiles.
The goal is to reduce the cost of the kinetic flooring until it’s the same price as “normal flooring”, as Kemball-Cook puts it. Whereas the price per unit now is currently around the same price as high end train station flooring (so circa £300 per unit).
How exactly does Pavegen generate substantial amounts of energy from footfall? Kemball-Cook says it’s a combination of electromagnetic induction and flywheel energy storage technology which maximizes the energy generated — allowing for a system that generates watts of energy per footstep.
“Storing energy within the inertia of a flywheel is a highly efficient way to take maximum power out of things,” he says. “So we’re really maximizing the amount [of energy] we can get. And we’re getting up to 7 watts per footstep pedestrian… We’ve combined several engineering principles in a way that’s never been done before. That allows us to capture all the energy from a footstep and then to maintain momentum in a flywheel through the duration of the footsteps.”
The design of Pavegen’s energy generation system means the product won’t work everywhere — a dusty corner of your kitchen isn’t going to yield enough footfall flow, for instance. But plenty of other locations can, such as busy pavements, hallways, transport terminals, corridors, public squares and so on. The company also has a division focused on temporary installations working with brands to serve marketing scenarios — such as, for instance, laying the product on a shopping street or during a marathon.
“If we put around 20 meters of Pavegen on Oxford Street in London we would generate more than enough power that’s needed for all the street lighting along that stretch. So A 20 meter array could kick out in the region of 1,500 watts. And we have systems that can do megawatts, so we’re getting into that space of what solar can do,” he adds.
Last year an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign to build a road paving product that generates power from solar energy raised more than $2.2 million. A solar cycleway also opened in the Netherlands in 2014. And while Pavegen’s first product is designed for pedestrian contact, not cars, the company is also looking to get into that space next.
“Next for us will be road technology. We know it’s harder but we’ve learnt a lot in deploying it in so many different countries,” says Kemball-Cook. He pours some cold water on the solar roads concept, arguing that a kinetic product will prove more economical and reliable as an energy-generating source in areas where there is high traffic flow than using solar.
“I think there’s some really big issues around maintenance and durability of solar panels on roads that I don’t think it will ever pay back in a way that will make it tangible. So I don’t believe that covering every single road in the world in solar panels would be a good idea economically. I think it would be really good for driveways in people’s houses and corporate headquarters but when you look at the cost base for it vs a normal road the economics don’t quite add up.”
Nearer term, Kemball-Cook sees retail being a big market for Pavegen’s initial product, given the added customer intelligence it can offer — based on in-store footfall tracking and analytics. In this scenario, the high tech flooring can act like iBeacon real-time tracking technology but without the need for batteries to power it.
We can actually tell a retailer in real-time that everyone walking in is going left… and how people are moving in different places.
“The way we look at it is we’re a deployable power source that doesn’t need batteries. It’s not like an iBeacon where you’ve got to put batteries in every two years and hope that people remember to put them in and all that. We can be a data hub that’s self-powered, with a computer in it, that can just be put in the ground and forgotten about and it can run all your services off it. And that’s what we’re really excited about,” he says. “We can actually tell a retailer in real-time that everyone walking in is going left… and how people are moving in different places.”
Looking further ahead, the startup has serious ambitions — gunning for mass global adoption of its kinetic flooring product, and becoming part of a renewable energy mix in urban centers where there is, after all, no shortage of footfall. The next pedestrian is ever just around the corner.
“We’ve spent the past few years really figuring it out. The technology has been really difficult. Lots of research has been taking place to allow us to get to the point where we have a product now. Our vision is that we can be deployed across, in mass, every major city in the world in every country. We aim to be a household name and to be working with every large flooring company, supplying energy technology to go within it. We believe we can break the £200 million revenue mark up to the next five years,” he adds.

395,Miito Deconstructs The Kettle To Save Energy,https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/23/miito/,2015/05/23,"
Europeans love little better than a nice cup of tea. Which means an awful lot of water is being boiled daily — only a portion of which is actually necessary, given most people aren’t fastidious enough to boil only the quantity of liquid they actually need to fill their cup or teapot.
Part of this wastage boils down to (inevitable) human laziness. But it can also be viewed as a byproduct of design. The volume of the kettle as a container has a suggestive effect, encouraging the user to fill it up before they hit the on switch.
And even though most kettles have a measuring scale to offer guidelines on how much water to boil based on how many cups you need, cup sizes vary and the minimum measure is still often more than is needed if you’re just making the one cuppa.
European designer duo, Nils Chudy and Jasmina Grase, decided a different kind of kettle was required to re-think the process of heating liquids — one that puts energy efficiency at the fore. The elegant result is Miito: a prototype ‘un-kettle’ that comprises an induction heating plate base, where you place whatever vessel of liquid you want to heat. And a metal heating rod that you stand inside the cup or pot to heat the water:

The Miito works with water but can also apparently heat other liquids, such as soup or baby food. Although one wonders how much collateral splattering of your kitchen surfaces might result from doing that in an open top vessel.
(The kettle does apparently automatically turn itself off once the liquid has reached boiling point. Which sounds like a minimum safety requirement, given boiling water can leap around a lot — and open topped containers aren’t going to offer any barrier to scalding splashes. But if the device is shutting off strictly at the point of boiling that’s another way to save energy.)
Mitto is only a prototype at his point, with the Berlin-based startup behind the design in the process of raising crowdfunds on Kickstarter to get their reworked kettle to market next year, with an estimated shipping schedule of April 2016. The device started life as a student project during their time at design school in the Netherlands.
At the time of writing the team has more than doubled its original crowdfunding target of €150,000 — pulling in pledges from close to 3,000 backers — still with almost three weeks left on the clock. So they are flush with more than enough funds (and tea lovers) to deliver a shipping product.
Early backers were offered Miito starting at €75 ($80). It’s since stepped up to €90 ($100). So it’s definitely a premium-priced (un)kettle. Albeit you should (in theory) be able to see some small electricity savings — provided you don’t start heating extra cups of tea just to get involved with such a cool design. That would be ironic.

396,Apple Settles Court Case With Battery Maker A123 Systems,https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/14/apple-settles-court-case-with-battery-maker-a123-systems/,2015/05/14,"
Apple has settled a court case with A123 Systems (via BBC), a battery company based in Massachusetts from which Apple hired some senior employees. A123 had filed a claim accusing Apple of poaching its engineers, particularly those leading key projects at the battery firm. The basis of the suit was that A123 claimed Apple was hiring the employees in order to build its own “large-scale battery division,” per the original court filing, in order to compete directly with A123.
Speculation about Apple’s intent for a battery division has varied. The company clearly makes use of advanced batteries in its existing lineup of devices, including the iPhone and Apple Watch. The new MacBook, for instance, uses a scalloped battery design to help it fit more power into its unique, tapered shell. But A123’s expertise appears to range into batteries aimed at larger hardware – including cars.
Apple’s rumored work on cars was a hot topic of speculation earlier this year, especially after the company’s list of related hires was examined in greater detail. A123’s ex-staff contributed to that round of rumor-fueling, but things have been subsequently relatively quiet on that front.
The details of this settlement between Apple and A123 were not disclosed, but it follows unsuccessful attempts by Apple to have the case thrown out. A123 Systems also filed for bankruptcy back in 2012, and has been liquidating its assets in order to help return to solvency. We’ll likely never find out exactly what transpired here in terms of the details of the settlement, but Apple is probably just happy more information about their plans for the five engineers hired away from A123 didn’t come to light.
Apple declined to comment when contacted by TechCrunch.

397,Our Four Favorite Companies At The 500 Startups Batch 12 Demo Day,https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/12/our-four-favorite-companies-at-the-500-startups-batch-12-demo-day/,2015/05/12,"
Oh look, it’s already that time of the year again — we’re down in Mountain View for another demo day from the 500 Startups accelerator.
Thirty companies pitched their products and business models to investors and the press today, and they all had impressive stats for revenue, addressable markets, and growth. Still, some startups just hit the right buttons with their pitches and got gears turning in our heads.
In the order they pitched, these are the companies that wowed us this afternoon:

Alfred – lets users repurpose old Android phones as Dropcam-style home security cameras that can be accessed from anywhere. In their first year, they had 1,000,000 phones added to their service, keeping literal tons of electronics from being sent to dumps. Their app has also become a daily habit for their users, who check up on their cat, kids, or empty home an average of 10 times per day.

Raur – building a podcasting service that brings together feeds from popular shows to listen to and tools for generating your own live and recorded content in a single app on your phone. This combined approach means there’s plenty of content to enjoy now, but down the road it could turn into Periscope or Meerkat for audio.
GridCure – analytics for the smart power grid. The company’s pitch is that power companies have invested billions in smart meters at their customers’ homes and businesses, but haven’t built the software needed to make the resulting deluge of data actionable. With GridCure, those power companies will be able to spot where power should be re-routed (wasting less energy overall) as well as identify irregular activity that could indicate “stolen” electricity.
Yellowdig – “Slack for education,” they’re building a service to replace the awful mishmash of backend software that looks like it’s from the 90s and email no one checks in college environments. They’ve done trials with 7,000 students to date, and hope to be in 100 universities by 2016.

398,Apple Leads The Pack In Greenpeace’s 2015 Clean Tech Update,https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/12/apple-leads-the-pack-in-greenpeaces-2015-clean-tech-update/,2015/05/12,"
Apple continues to be a leader in environmental initiatives among tech companies, according to a new report issued by watchdog agency Greenpeace. Among the top 13 tech companies listed, Apple is the only one to score 100 percent on the Clean Energy Index, which includes all of its planned data centre expansions.
This past year, Apple has announced plans to build a new data HQ in Arizona, which will be powered by solar which Apple is helping bring on-line. The company also announced initiatives to expand its renewable energy plans to China earlier this week, and revealed plans to build green data centres in both Ireland and Denmark back in February.

Apple also ranked above the rest as the only company to earn A grades across the board for transparency in its energy sources, commitment and policy around renewable energy, energy efficiency and migration, and renewable energy advocacy and deployment. No other company on the list achieved this, though Facebook managed three As and a B.
In a detailed look at Apple’s specific strategy, Greenpeace lauded its ramp up of environmental initiatives specifically in the last year. Part of the reason for the resounding support is that the organization says Apple’s commitment is driving change among its partners and among its data center operation peers and competitors, meaning it’s having a significant impact on the environmental picture as a whole.

399,Apple Expands Its Renewable Paper And Energy Initiatives To China,https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/10/apple-environment/,2015/05/10,"
Apple will extend several of its environmental projects in China, one of its fastest-growing markets.
These initiatives include a partnership with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to protect forests used in the production of paper packaging for Apple items, as well as an effort to increase the use of renewable energy in factories that supply Apple components.
According to the WWF, China is the world’s largest producer and consumer of paper products. Its partnership with Apple is a five-year project meant to reduce the amount of water and pollution created during the paper production process by implementing new forestry techniques, growing tree plantations instead of harvesting wood pulp from natural forests, and increasing the use of recycled paper.
Apple’s announcement comes three weeks after it said that it will build solar power plants in Sichuan Province with several Chinese companies including SunPower. Apple has already worked with SunPower on projects in the U.S., including solar panel farms for data centers in Reno and North Carolina.
The Cupertino-based company says that 87 percent of its global operations — including data centers, retail stores and offices — currently run on renewable energy and the Sichuan Province project “will bring Apple even closer to its commitment to reach 100 percent.”
China is not only one of Apple’s main sources for components, but also among its most important markets. Last quarter, revenue from iPhone sales there rose 71 percent to $16.8 billion. This means that the company’s environmental initiatives are more than just public relations boosters—if they succeed, they can make a sizable impact.

400,Liquidity Launches To Bring Clean Water To Everyone,https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/04/liquidity-launches-to-bring-clean-water-to-everyone/,2015/05/04," 



Liquidity Nanotech is trying to change the world. But for once, the cliché could actually be applicable. The company is launching today onstage at Disrupt NY 2015 with the Naked Filter, a consumer water bottle with its proprietary water-filtration membrane built-in.
Liquidity doesn’t look like an average startup. Built on over 15 years of patented university research, the team is a who’s who from the biggest and most respected names in the water business.
The company’s CTO was formerly the head of 3M’s Worldwide Water Group. The director of technology came from Brita, where she was the technical lead. One of their founders invented reverse osmosis, the process that makes desalination possible.
At a glance, the Naked Filter looks like any other camping water bottle. The key is what’s going on under the surface.

Liquidity’s core technology was developed and patented out of Stony Brook University. It’s a membrane with pores of .2 microns in width, small enough to eliminate microbial contaminants that make up the vast majority of water quality incidents. This includes issues that are common in both developed and emerging markets from E. coli and Salmonella to SARS and even the norovirus.
Of course, water purification methods and filters are available today but often force users to choose between effectiveness and convenience, which has made adoption extremely difficult. On the effective side, chemicals like iodine and chlorine change the taste of the water and UV requires a long wait time and filters that require pumping or a high level of pressure provided by the user — the latter which is especially challenging for children.
Then there is the at-home purification market with the majority of those products doing nothing to improve water quality but simply improving taste. Easy to use, but ineffective.
Recognizing this, the Liquidity team designed their first product, Naked Filter, to showcase their membrane in a way that fit into existing consumer habits. The water bottle flows at nearly the same rate as those without a filter included. The is possible because the filter is made up of between 80-90 percent open space, there is almost no pressure or wait time required to move water through the membrane making the product hugely convenient to consumers. (Traditional membranes hover around 20 percent of open space.)

To create the nano-fiber thin membrane that could be produced at scale, Liquidity had to invent their own manufacturing process. Over the past 10 years, Liquidity has done just that, perfecting its patented electro-spinning 3D-printing technology.
The process begins with liquid polymer and a collector plate. Voltage is applied to the polymer and plate, which creates a pull to draw the liquid polymer out of its container toward the plate. As the polymer travels, it becomes increasingly thin. So thin, in fact, that at some point, air resistance actually begins to influence the flow of the liquid, causing the now-thin polymer to become convoluted as it falls onto the collector plate.
During the trip, the polymer solution also converts to a solid. The resulting pattern is a 3D mat of a seemingly random, extremely thin fiber array.

This filtration membrane is highly flexible and durable and can be produced in a variety of sizes.
Electro-spinning is not a new process. However, the Liquidity team developed a multi-nozzle system allowing for membranes to be manufactured at scale.
Previously, existing materials and production techniques limited the ability of a filter to only capture microbes that were larger than 1 micron. With their newly minted method of fiber formation, Liquidity pore size is down around .2 microns.

Liquidity’s tech has been third-party verified by BioVir Laboratories, a microbiological testing facility, that it meets the EPA standard of 99.9999 percent bacterial removal for safe drinking water.
Though the tech is strong, the challenge of adoption still remains. By creating a bottle that is extremely easy to use, Liquidity hopes first to tackle the outdoor enthusiasm of Western countries. As of today, you can pre-order the Naked Filter bottle on their website; it ships this summer. The company is also looking to provide in-home and in-office filtration systems.
A larger market opportunity is in the emerging middle class of countries like Brazil and India. These regions have poor infrastructure and water quality but increasing purchasing power. Many are already using some type of at-home method of water purification but with little success.
Ultimately, though, Liquidity sees its strength as a technology player and aims to become the “Intel Inside” of the water industry. Industrial applications in everything from medical and pharma to oil and gas are huge.

401,Is Your Marijuana Growing / Testing / Delivery / Vaporizer Startup Idea Genius Or Half-Baked?,https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/04/ever-founded-a-company-___on-weed/,2015/05/04,"


Everyone seems to have a marijuana startup idea. Snoop Dogg even raised a venture fund to invest in them. But would you believe it? Coming up with business plans while you’re high is not a fool-proof way to get rich!
According to two experts, many of the opportunities are so crowded with competitors that you’d first have to invent a time machine and go back three years.
Brendan Kennedy is the co-founder of Privateer Holdings, a private equity firm that invests in marijuana startups. Geoff Lewis is a partner at Peter Thiel’s prestigious Founders Fund, which backs Privateer. In this video, I ask them about the potential of a bunch of weed startup ideas. They’re about to kill your buzz.

402,The 2016 Chevy Volt Will Cost Just $26K After Tax Credits,https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/03/the-2016-chevy-volt-will-cost-just-26k-after-tax-credits/,2015/05/03,"
Chevrolet just announced the final pricing for its 2016 Chevy Volt plug-in hybrid, and it’s surprisingly affordable.
If you get the full $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles, the new Volt will come in at $26,495. If you happen to live in California, state-level credits can bring that down to just $24,995. That’s newsworthy because it’s starting to dip into traditional hybrid price territory; if you look at the closest comparable offerings from Ford, Honda or Toyota, you’re looking at ~$25,000.
While those vehicles all get great mileage compared to similarly sized sedans powered solely by internal combustion, the Volt has a massive battery that lets you handle most trips on electricity alone.
One of the big selling points for the original Volt was that the vast majority of Americans’ commutes were less than the vehicle’s 40-mile range; the 2016 Volt’s battery allows you to keep going for up to 50 miles before the engine has to kick in to power the electric motor. Even with gas prices going down, the fact that you can go weeks without stopping at the pump means you’ll spend hundreds of dollars less on fuel each year in addition to saving a bunch of time.
If you don’t take the applicable state and federal tax credits into account, the 2016 Chevy Volt will come in at $33,995. That’s still $1,200 less than last year’s model, impressive considering the improved range — and the glacial pace of progress in battery technology.

403,"Tesla’s $3,000 Powerwall Will Let Households Run Entirely On Solar Energy",https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/30/tesla-powerwall-home-battery/,2015/04/30,"
You almost certainly associate Tesla with cars — very cool cars — but the company has an even grander vision beyond that. Today, CEO and founder Elon Musk unveiled ‘Tesla Energy’ — a new business arm that is focused on ending our dependence on grid power and switching instead to solar energy.
The first Tesla Energy product is ‘Powerwall Home Battery,’ a stationary battery that can power a household without requiring the grid. The battery is rechargeable lithium-ion — it uses Tesla’s existing battery tech — and can be fixed to a wall, removing much of the existing complexity around using a local power source.
“The issue with existing batteries is that they suck,” Musk said in a press conference announcing Tesla Energy. “They are expensive, unreliable and bad in every way.”
Tesla’s solution, he said, is different.
For one thing, the company’s batteries cost $3,500 for 10kWh and $3,000 for 7kWh — add your snarky Apple Watch price comparison here. They are open for pre-orders in the U.S. now; the first orders will be dispatched “in late summer.”
Like regular batteries, they can be used together — up to nine can be stacked up together to create a strong and reliable power source. Musk said he believes they can help people in emerging markets or remote locations ‘leapfrog’ the need for existing power systems, in a similar way that mobile phones have become more important than landlines in remote parts of the world.
A Tesla car is (sadly) not included with your purchase
The Tesla Powerwall charges using solar power, but it also integrates with the grid “to harness excess power and give customers the flexibility to draw energy from their own reserve.” The batteries recharge in a ‘smart’ way, saving money by picking low-rate periods when electricity is cheapest. They store solar energy for later, for example overnight, and can act as a back-up in the event of a power outage.
Removing dirty energy is an ambitious plan — much like space travel — but Musk believes it can be done. He explained that 160 million battery packs could “transition” power usage in the U.S. to renewable energy, while 900 million units could shift the entire world’s energy needs. Then there is the potential to make the world’s cars run on clean energy.
“This is within the power of humanity to do,” Musk said. “It is not impossible, it is something that we can do. But there’s going to [need to] be other companies involved.”

Musk has made electric cars a (stylish) reality, and is pioneering space exploration with SpaceX. Tesla Energy is another concept which, though beyond the realm of most people’s understanding, has potentially huge consequences if Tesla can execute as Musk believes it can.

404,"uBeam’s Ultrasound Wireless Charging Is Real, And About To Be Really Funded",https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/26/kill-the-cord/,2015/04/26,"
What if wireless power at a distance actually worked? It does. uBeam invented a way to wirelessly send energy up to 15 feet away with ultrasound.
What if you could slap a wireless charging case on your phone and charge it while you move around or use it? uBeam invented that too. While early uBeam prototype were massive, non-portable boxes that merely shot power around, it now has a working version that consumers would want.
And what if your phone could wirelessly charge while you’re at Starbucks because they installed the transmitters? You’d probably be more likely to stop by.
That’s why sources confirm to TechCrunch that major brands are vying to become strategic investors of uBeam in hopes of scoring exclusivity deals so they’ll be the first retail locations to offer uBeam wireless charging. uBeam is seeking exclusive partnerships with the #1 players in several retail verticals.
Starbucks is said to be especially near to striking deals to join a strategic investor round that will close soon, and uBeam is also in talks with the top names like Virgin in air travel, Starwood hotels, and some huge fast food chains. uBeam has also spoken with leading hardware manufacturers like Apple and Samsung.
uBeam’s case will wirelessly charge phones
Meanwhile, traditional venture capitalists are foaming at the mouth over uBeam’s future. Now that it’s product has gone from fantasy, to impractical, to what looks like the future of power in just a few years, they’re ready to throw money at uBeam and its plucky founder Meredith Perry. While it may not ask for much money beyond the strategic round, sources say it’s looking towards a massive Series B that could be around $50 million or more, with a valuation of $500 million or even much higher depending on progress.
When asked, uBeam declined to comment on this article.
The new money would add to the $10 million Series A led by Upfront Ventures that uBeam raised in October, which also included many investors from its $3.2 million in seed rounds such as Andreessen Horowitz, Founders Fund, Ludlow Ventures, CrunchFund (run by TechCrunch’s founder), Troy Carter, Shawn Fanning, Mark Cuban, Ken Seiff, Ellen Levy, and Tony Hsieh.
A lot of smart people believe.
Wireless Power Via Ultrasound
Plenty of other companies have tried and failed to produce true wireless power, with some ending up doing magnetic resonance charging. But that requires devices to be so close to transmitters or even touching, so they may as well be plugged in. It’s linear innovation, not exponential innovation.
However, the buzz amongst prestigious funds is that after due diligence research, many think uBeam’s style of wireless charging will work for consumers and could have utterly massive potential.
A bulky early uBeam transmitter prototype
Specifically, uBeam relies on ultrasonic transduction. Transmitters take power from an outlet or building’s electircal system, convert it into ultrasonic sound waves, and then beam the vibrations towards a device with a receiver, like a phone with a wireless charging case. uBeam’s transmitters can retarget the receivers as they move to maximize the energy transfer. The receiver converts the ultrasound vibrations into energy, which is then fed into the device it’s attached to, charging it. uBeam is said to be able to charge at a similar speed to plugging your phone into the wall.
uBeam’s ultrasound wireless charging has several advantages. First and foremost, it’s safe. These are similar ultrasonic waves used for ultrasound scans of babies in the womb. The receivers are cheap, possibly costing around $50 or less a source says, and slim, so they’re not annoying to attach to your phone. The same waves can also transmit data, which could turn uBeam into a way to connect Internet Of Things devices.
But what makes it so attractive to consumers will be that devices can charge at a distance of around 15 feet (though that could improve), even while a device is moving. That means you could carry your phone around and use it in a room outfitted with transmitters, and see your battery percentage grow.

Death To Cords
Wireless charging cases could free people from hunching by electrical outlets and rationing their energy all day. While smartphones have gotten progressively more slim and powerful, battery life has struggled to keep up. That’s not only a drain on satisfaction with smartphones, it stifles the entire mobile economy as a lack of power keeps people from downloading apps, shopping, or using on-demand services. uBeam could provide economic stimulus along with the delight and convenience people will pay for.
uBeam CEO Meredith Perry [by Paul Mauer]Then there’s the tech giants. Smartphone manufacturers like Apple and Samsung are desperate to solve their charging problems, and find a way to differentiate themselves in a lucrative but crowded market. There could be natural acquisition interest in uBeam, especially since the company and Perry hold several wireless charging patents that could prove highly valuable.
uBeam just received approval on another important patent this month. It covers how uBeam’s transmitters and receivers can communicate about configurations and which devices the transmitters should prioritize. These giants might be willing to pay a premium to buy uBeam just to keep it out of their competitors’ phones.
But long-term, if uBeam’s wireless charging protocol reaches its full potential, it could be the death of the power cord. Not just for phones, but for an extraordinarily wide array of electronics. Anywhere you see a charging cord, just imagine uBeam’s technology inside the device instead.
To be clear, uBeam is still working on a hard science problem where unexpected setbacks can happen. There are plenty of reasons it might not be able to get as cheap, powerful, fast, and safe as Perry hopes. But if it does, uBeam could be one of the transformative technologies of our era. And that’s just the swing for the fences that investors dream of.

405,"Cleantech Is Dead, Long Live Cleantech",https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/18/cleantech-is-dead-long-live-cleantech/,2015/04/18,"
Editor’s note: Rob Day is a venture capital and project finance investor with Black Coral Capital, a private-equity firm based in Boston, Mass.
I’m old enough to remember when the smartest folks on Sand Hill Road thought cleantech was going to be the next big thing. When venture dollars into the “sector” (really, a loose collection of very different markets and technologies, bundled together under a convenient label) were growing by leaps and bounds year over year. When the New York Times declared “Capitalism to the Rescue” in embarrassingly fawning terms. When Alan Salzman of VantagePoint declared that cleantech startups would be bigger than Google, Cisco, and Amgen. And of course, CalPERS’ “Green Wave.”
Today, of course, “cleantech” is almost a forbidden word on Sand Hill Road. Only a few stalwart specialist investors still wave the banner; quarterly venture capital investments into clean energy are only around a third or less of what they were at their peak in 2008, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Cleantech specialist VCs are getting shut down, and generalist VCs often refuse to take meetings with cleantech entrepreneurs.
How on earth did we get here?
Cleantech is on the outs among VCs right now because it got overhyped. Badly overhyped. 
Is this the natural result of a huge “cleantech crash,” as 60 Minutes portrayed it a year ago? How can that be true, when these markets are actually booming. According to Greentech Media, US solar PV installations grew at a compound annual growth rate of over 60 percent from 2009 to 2014; the industry is now 108 times larger than it was a decade ago. The market for efficient lighting is expected by some analysts to grow to over $50 billion in 2015. Electric vehicle sales, led by Tesla, are booming.
Yes, there was a “cleantech crash,” but it was limited to selected upstream commodity markets like panel manufacturing and biofuels. And that price collapse led to an explosion of downstream markets like rooftop solar. Furthermore, the need for new resource solutions isn’t going away anytime soon — dry enough for ya, Californian readers? As a result of clear market needs and increasingly attractive economics, global revenue from advanced energy reached nearly $1.3 trillion last year.
Okay, so is it instead that investors found out — as CalPERS’ former CIO publicly stated last year — that cleantech “has been a noble way to lose money”? That, regardless of markets, even smart investors can’t make returns in the sector? Well, CalPERS’ own experience may match that negative perspective.
But data from Cambridge Associates, looking more broadly across all of the venture capital world and not just the firms that CalPERS chose to back, suggests that investors have indeed made money in cleantech. Not the kind of returns that were hyped up nearly a decade ago by Sand Hill Road’s best and brightest, sure, and certainly not in the kind of upstream, capital-intensive, commodity manufacturing plays that were en vogue back then.
But Cambridge Associates found that investments made in the sector with other strategies have actually provided results roughly on par with returns for the overall venture capital industry during the same period.
Basically, the lesson isn’t that you can’t make returns in cleantech. The lesson is that if we investors can’t figure out how to generate attractive returns off of the growth going on in these markets right now, blame the investors and the strategies we chose. Don’t blame the markets.
Well then, maybe it’s just that cleantech investors can’t generate exits? Okay, exit volumes definitely have been lower than hoped. But it’s not like there haven’t been some great outcomes to point to (you may have heard of companies like Tesla, Nest and SolarCity at some point). And despite the lack of excitement in these markets among VCs, large corporate acquirers from GE to Google have all been eagerly ramping up their commitments to these markets. Besides, what proof is there that a lack of exits dampens VC enthusiasm for putting money to work when otherwise things seem exciting?
Disruptions replace old, wasteful networks with new dynamic ones.
Cleantech is on the outs among VCs right now because it got overhyped. Badly overhyped. And when the dominant investment strategy at the height of the hype cycle didn’t work out, coinciding with the overall economic meltdown of seven years ago, VCs declared the entire sector a failure. And that word got out to their limited partners. And now it’s the LPs saying “don’t go there.” Thus, cleantech specialist VCs can’t raise new funds. And generalist VCs can’t even mention being intrigued by these markets without getting pushback from even the most loyal of their LPs.
But this is 2015, not 2008. The sector now is very different. Entrepreneurs have learned hard lessons, and a new generation of investors are establishing new strategies that seem to be bearing fruit.
On the whole, capital-intensive, long-gestation-period, deep technology innovation plays don’t define cleantech entrepreneurship any longer. Instead, entrepreneurs and investors still charging ahead in the sector are following the same script that has been working well for the rest of the venture industry.
They’re tackling the market opportunity with web and SaaS models. With new financing platforms, and new service models. They’re looking to be downstream, close to those juicy, fast-growth markets, with new channels and new marketplaces. Even in hardware, they’ve moved to distributed, smaller, modular, automated and intelligent hardware. After all, as Marc Andreessen declared, “Software is eating the world” and these markets are no exception.
In fact, the commoditization of IT and communications technologies, matched with the commoditization of clean technologies like solar panels and batteries, is underpinning the rapid growth of distributed generation and other similar markets. And some of us have learned how to finance projects at massive scale without having to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into Series E rounds.
But all is for naught. Because cleantech investors can’t raise money, and thus cleantech entrepreneurs can’t raise capital, and thus cleantech is dead. The end.
Or is it? There’s a basic truth at work in entrepreneurship and innovation, that most often a key advantage of successful new approaches is that they are in some way more efficient than the old, established systems. Disruptions replace old, wasteful networks with new dynamic ones. Along the way (on purpose or as a happy accident), natural resource savings are captured. And this means it’s increasingly hard to draw boundaries between “cleantech” and mainstream venture capital right now.
To give an example from our own portfolio, Digital Lumens sells lighting systems that save 90 percent of the energy older lighting systems use — and they’re doing this by embedding controls and intelligence into every LED fixture. It’s an operating system for lights, leveraging the fact that lights are increasingly solid state devices at their core. For their customers, such as big commercial retail and manufacturers, there’s a lot more value to be gained than just the energy savings, once they start using the data from all of these ceiling-mounted intelligent devices for other purposes as well. It’s this IT-driven value proposition, and the OS-like network effects, that attracted our co-investors to the company — investors that for the most part would never label themselves “cleantech.”
After all, a list of what’s hot in VC land these days would definitely include Internet of Things, as well as food/agtech, transportation and fintech. And guess what you’ll find in many cleantech investor portfolios? The same list.
A few months back I was at a lunch with several limited partners, and when I described that my group focuses on cleantech, everyone kind of politely nodded appreciatively, mumbled something about how hard the sector is, and then started talking about other things. Much more exciting things, like Google’s $3.2 billion acquisition of Nest. “You know,” I mentioned to the person who had brought up that example, “Nest was actually a big win for the cleantech sector.”
He smirked and replied, “But Nest isn’t really cleantech, is it.”
There is a huge economic transfer underway, from century-old, inflexible incumbents, to new upstarts led by entrepreneurs who don’t care what label you apply to them.
Yes, I know energy savings weren’t the core motivation for Tony and team to tackle smart thermostats as their first product. And there were definitely investors in that company who didn’t care much about energy savings; they loved the team and their audacity. But there were also investors that I know firsthand who were attracted to the company because of the efficiency angle. Cleantech investors who rightfully point to Nest as one of their big wins.
The distinction between cleantech and tech is increasingly fuzzy and meaningless.
So… entrepreneurs are indeed still excited about these markets. And mainstream VCs are indeed still investing in cleantech. They’re just not calling it as such, or defining it with the same subcategories. Instead, innovators and investors are defining the companies in terms of what they actually do.
They’re lending platforms financing billions in commercial building improvements. They’re using the Internet of Things and automation to break up the old electric utility’s natural monopoly. They’re building new channels, touching tens of thousands of consumers every year, helping bring new technology into the home. They’re new “sharing economy” platforms that provide convenience and superior customer experience for travelers, while — oh by the way — leading to fewer hotels being built and fewer cars added to the road. Just don’t call it “cleantech” please.

406,GE Spotlights New Smart Street Lamps,https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/16/ge-spotlights-new-smart-street-lamps/,2015/04/16,"
GE has a new smart street light in early production, and it hopes that over time, cities and third-party developers will begin to take advantage of the platform to build smart city apps.
The light itself is a super-efficient LED that could last up to 20 years. Where it gets interesting is that GE is including a sensor pack with each bulb with capabilities such as video, light and weather sensors, and giving cities and developers access to its Predix Internet of Things software development platform to build applications based on the data the sensors generate.
As Bill Ruh, VP and global technology director at GE points out, the lighting division is one of GE’s oldest businesses, but the company recognizes the shifting market, and it wants to capitalize on the changing mindset with smarter and more efficient lighting technology.
There are currently two test cities using this lighting today: San Diego and Jacksonville.
Shedding Light On A Problem
“It used to be about generating and wattage a visibility, but today’s product has the potential to be much more,” he explained. “[The light pole] has power and networking and adding sensors, you can now do things with these lights everywhere.”
This means, cities can potentially take advantage of the data being generated by the sensors, and using the GE Predix platform, begin building applications for public safety, transportation, intelligent digital signs and the environment.
The cost of traditional lighting has been a drain on cities and towns and can often account for up to 40 percent of a municipality’s electric bill, Ruh said. This could explain why many cities and towns looking for ways to cut budgets have actually been turning off street lights over the last decade. He claims the new smart street lights can save 50-70 percent on electricity over standard bulbs, and with that savings the new lights can pay for themselves in around 5 years.
Part of that efficiency is gained from LED lighting technology, but it also benefits from being intelligent to run more effectively. From a pure lighting perspective, a smart light can use sensors to brighten or dim as needed or even turn itself on or off, depending on conditions like traffic, weather and so forth.
Making Sensors Of It All
What really separates these lights from the run-of-the-mill light bulb is the pack of sensors that GE provides with each one. These could be weather sensors or a video camera that can see traffic, parking violations and so forth.
As an example, the video sensor generates visual data to apply to any application, Rue said. You could count cars to plan transportation or use video for public safety purposes.
“We essentially provide data from sensors for developers who want to build applications for the city. The cost savings and applications depend on how you use them,” Ruh explained.
If you’re wondering about the privacy implications of a video camera on every light pole, Ruh says it’s up to each city to set policies around the data collected by the sensors and how it can be used. He adds that citizens should have a say in that policy.
There are many companies offering individual applications for cities such as smart metering and video technology, according to Ruh, but where he believes GE separates from these offerings is by providing a more complete platform to build these applications in a single place.
He also understands many cities already use streetlights as a platform to power digital signs such as the ones you see over highways, making announcements about road closings or encouraging you not to text and drive. With GE’s system, cities can still tap into the same power and networking, but they can also communicate with the Predix cloud and generate content based on conditions (such as an impending snowstorm or a water main break).
Rolling With The Changes
GE also makes power plants, wind turbines and other equipment to generate electricity, so there has to be an inherent tension inside the company when it comes to creating highly efficient light bulbs that generate much less electricity. Ruh admits there are heated internal debates, but the company recognizes that it needs to react to the market, and not simply protect existing businesses.
There’s also the matter of changing business models. When you only need to replace a light bulb every 15 or 20 years, the company needs to figure out different ways to make money, and Ruh says that’s part of the reason for the sensors and the app platform. If the company can generate recurring revenue from the data it collects or through revenue sharing with third-party developers, he believes it can begin to fill in some of this revenue gap created by selling more efficient bulbs.
But it’s early days for this type of experiment and with just two cities in operation, it still has a long way to go to prove itself as a viable business. You could argue you don’t even need electric-powered lights. Why not just put a small solar panel on each pole and let the light pole generate its own power?
GE is clearly searching for ways to monetize its Predix platform while finding ways to modernize long-standing businesses. Transforming an older company like GE is a huge challenge, and the company is working on a lot of fronts. The smart light is just one attempt.

407,MudWatt Lets Kids Build Batteries That Run On Mud,https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/08/mudwatt-lets-kids-build-batteries-that-run-on-mud/,2015/04/08,"
A startup that wants to encourage kids to get excited about science and engineering, MudWatt, is now selling an affordable, fun (and, yes, a bit messy), science kit by way of Kickstarter that allows children to make electricity using just mud and electrodes. After the bacteria bloom in the mud, the kit can be used to power simple electronics, including a clock, thermometer and buzzer, which MudWatt also ships with select kits.
The company is further along than others sometimes featured on Kickstarter because it’s actually been in development for several years. And more recently, the team participated in Stanford’s StartX incubator where the co-founders learned more about the toy industry in general.
Explains co-founder Keegan Cooke, the idea for the MudWatt was initially sparked following his work as a research scientist at a small startup called Trophos Energy, which was acquired in 2010. While there, he was developing prototypes of undersea microbial fuel cell systems which used ocean sediment as their power source instead of batteries. During this time, Cooke also went to a number of educational events to show school kids what he was working on, and soon found that children were genuinely interested and engaged with the technology demonstrations.

Along with friend and co-founder Kevin Rand, the two began to build what later became the MudWatt in their spare time over the course of several years while working other jobs and going through grad school. But the more feedback they got from the kit’s early users, the more the two realized there may be the potential to take the product beyond just being a fun side project.
To date, the founders have sold 6,000 of their older-style kits and are now selling at a rate of about 200 kits per month.
“That’s a great milestone given that we never actually tried to sell it. We’ve never done any advertising or anything,” explains Cooke. “But we now see that this is just a drop in the bucket and we could turn this into a legitimate business,” he adds.
On Kickstarter, the team is launching the latest version of the MudWatt kit, which includes several improvements, including compostable packaging and upgraded components. Depending on which kit package you opt for, it will include two graphite electrodes, a board with an LED light, a container of some sort, instructions, and access to the MudWatt Explorer mobile app for iOS and Android.

To use MudWatt, kids add mud from either their own backyard or from a bag bought at a garden store, and then add their own fuel – meaning, generally, something from the fridge. Kids are encouraged to think about what bacteria like to eat, and then pour in whatever it is they think will give the MudWatt a boost – whether that’s Gatorade or ketchup or something else.
In a few days, the LED light will begin to blink, indicating that the container of mud now houses colonies of special bacteria that are generating electricity. By maintaining the colonies in different ways, MudWatt can then be used to run other experiments.
The blinking frequency will increase over time as you build more bacteria, and kids can then connect different things to the kit, like a buzzer, clock, thermometer or their own device, like an LCD calculator, for instance.

The mobile app, meanwhile, is able to detect the blink frequency, which correlates to how much bacteria you’ve grown, and then tells kids how much bacteria they have and how much power they’re generating. The app also unlocks a comic book which follows a hero, an electric microbe, through his muddy world.
Ultimately, Cooke says the larger goal – beyond just getting kids excited about the scientific details itself – is to foster an interest and appreciation for the complexity of the world beneath their feet.
Plus, he says, “we’re seeing a push towards inquiry-based education and open-ended investigation where kids create their own questions and design their own experiments,” explains Cooke. “That’s another core theme we hope kids will learn with our kit.”
Now the founders are thinking of creating more kits like MudWatt focused on these same larger concepts, like a biofuel kit that uses “swamp goo” (algae), for example.
The MudWatt DeepDig Kit is $59, though you can provide your own container and extra gadgets and knock the price down to $29. For schools, there’s also a Classroom Pack with 10 kits available for $350.
As of the time of writing, the company has raised over $26,300 of its $30,000 Kickstarter goal.

408,Tesla’s New Entry-Level Model S 70D Adds All-Wheel Drive And 240 Mile Range,https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/08/teslas-new-entry-level-model-s-70d-adds-all-wheel-drive-and-240-mile-range/,2015/04/08,"
Tesla has a new entry-level Model S, called the 70D, which offers a 70 kWh battery and all-wheel drive, and which replaces the entry-level Model S 60 in the range. The new 70D offers 240 miles of maximum range, vs. just 2018 for the outgoing entry-level rear-wheel drive base Model S, but will also cost $5,000 more to start with a beginning price of $74,900.
The new base model Tesla is still a better value than the outgoing version, overall, and takes advantage of Tesla’s improving economies of sales from production of the higher end 85, 85D and P85D editions of the vehicle to make better tech available in the lower end.
Tesla has an aggressive sales target of 55,000 vehicles by end of year for 2015, which is above its existing pace of quarterly unit sales, and the 70D is likely an attempt to juice sales numbers at the entry-level of the line, which has traditionally lagged those of the higher end versions.
Other benefits of the new 70D include the inclusion of hardware that makes it compatible with the rapid charging Tesla superstations dotting the country, and its total range is only 25 miles under the 85 line of cars. It has a top speed of 140 MPH, with 0 to 60 time achieved in just 5.2 seconds.

Apple has expanded its trade-in program, which offers credit towards new device purchases in exchange for older hardware, to non-Apple smartphones and PCs (via 9to5Mac). News of the program expansion comes from changed language on Apple Store pages describing the reuse and recycle initiative on Apple’s U.S., UK, Canada and some other European store sites.
The trade-in program is operated by third-party partners to Apple, which helps explain why they’d also be interested in securing older non-Apple hardware for refurbishment. Expanding the program also helps Apple add incentives for switchers looking to come over to either iOS or Mac from a different platform, including Android and Windows.

Eligibility for the program covers the vast majority of flagship Android manufacturers, Apple tells us. These include (but are not necessarily limited to) Sony, Samsung, Nokia, LG, HTC and BlackBerry devices specifically. Even if devices aren’t included because of age or condition, Apple will still help customers recycle old hardware. PC trade-ins appear to be fairly broad in terms of what’s included, but it’s liable to change on a country-to-country basis, as Apple has different partners in each region for its credit swapping programs.
The new expanded trade-in program is live in the US, Canada, UK, Germany, France and Italy as of today.

410,CloudSolar Helps Renewable Energy Fans Who Can’t Install Their Own Solar Panels,https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/26/cloudsolar/,2015/03/26,"
Solar panels are becoming increasingly affordable, but many people still face barriers to harnessing the power of the sun for their own homes. For example, they might live in an apartment or in a house where the roof is angled or structured improperly for solar panel installation.
A new Boston-based startup called CloudSolar is offering an intriguing solution. Founded by a team including two electrical engineering Ph.D. candidates and currently raising funds on Indiegogo, CloudSolar lets people buy a solar panel, or a share in one, on a farm that is expected to be completed by 2016 (erecting the solar panels will only take a couple of months, but the company also has to deal with utility and land permits, which will take longer).
Once the farm is up and operating, electricity generated by the solar panels will be sold to local utilities. Solar panel owners are promised 80 percent of the total proceeds created by the panels over the next 25 years, and help with applying for whatever tax credits they are eligible for. They can monitor how much energy their panel is producing, and how much carbon dioxide emissions it is estimated to offset, through an app.
The idea is similar to community solar gardens, which provide power to local subscribers, but is not limited to people within a specific area. Though the first CloudSolar farm will be built in New England (the company won’t disclose the exact location yet, citing competition), people from around the world have participated in its Indiegogo campaign, which has raised about $280,000 of its $300,000 flexible funding goal with eight days left to go. A full panel costs $750, but contributors can also purchase a quarter share in a panel for $250.
Making it easier to participate in the renewable energy movement

Contributors hail from across the U.S., as well as countries including Australia, Canada, France, Italy, and England, which makes CloudSolar’s team hopeful that they will be able to scale their business model relatively quickly.
Founders Michael Sun, Cory Absi, and Xiaohang Li came up with the idea behind CloudSolar after looking around Boston and noticing the lack of solar panels on rooftops. This was especially striking to Sun, whose PhD research at Boston University focuses on solar cell and LED efficiency.
“Cory installed solar panels and his neighbors kept coming to him and asking him how to get them so they could save on their energy bills,” says Sun. “But they talked to developers and were told that their roofs needed to be reinforced for solar panels or were not properly angled.”
“We thought there should be a better way. Why not help them go solar by putting their panels in a remote area. So we borrowed ideas from cloud computing, and combined it with the Internet of Things and traditional solar energy.”
CloudSolar’s target consumers are people who are frustrated by their inability to install solar panels on their own homes, but still want to feel like they are contributing to the renewable energy movement.
“When we talk to our contributors, most of them are environmentally conscious people who are also interested in perhaps getting a decent economic return from their contribution,” says Sun. He adds a substantial amount of contributions have come from non-profits that have purchased solar panels on behalf of their organization or its members, as well as idealistic parents who are giving the solar panels as gifts to their very young children.
Tackling the challenge of scaling up around the world
To be sure, there are several potential drawbacks to the project. For one thing, the financial returns from CloudSolar panels are probably not enough to offset the cost of running a home using traditional energy. It’s also difficult to say with certainty if the power generated by a remote solar panel is enough to make up for the amount of carbon emissions its owner creates.
As with any startup, there is also the risk of CloudSolar folding. In that case, the company would ship solar panels directly to their owners. The CloudSolar farm will also be fully insured against natural disasters, like snowstorms, and theft.
Sun is optimistic, however, that CloudSolar’s business model will work, in part because of renewable energy targets set by governments around the world. For example, in the U.S., government agencies, the largest energy consumers in the country, are expected to derive 20 percent of their total electricity used from renewable sources by 2020.
CloudSolar is in discussions with several utility companies and local developers to buy the energy generated by its farm, but can’t disclose which ones until after the Indiegogo campaign is finished. If the money raised from the Indiegogo campaign is not enough to fully finance the project, CloudSolar will also pursue capital from angel investors, venture capital firms, or take out private loans.
Sun hopes eventually to bring CloudSolar’s business model to other countries including his native China, where air pollution is notoriously awful.
“I’m very passionate about clean energy. Air pollution is a huge problem in China,” says Sun, who grew up in Ningbo. “I want to prove the concept and pursue the dream here in the U.S. If it proves to scalable, I can carry on the project there.”

411,"YC Graduate GiveMeTap Offers Free Water And Footfall Data For Stores, And It Helps Africa",https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/20/yc-graduate-givemetap-offers-free-water-footfall-data-for-stores-and-helps-africa/,2015/03/20,"
Despite the growth in reusable water bottles, keeping them refilled is tough. Ironically, consumers either end up buying a plastic bottle of water, are forced to use a toilet to refill, or feel obliged to buy something from a store before asking for a refill of water.
GiveMeTap is a new graduate of the Y Combinator accelerator with a rather clever idea. It sells and produces stainless steel water bottles that you can use to get free water refills from participating local cafes and restaurants, which are located by using the GiveMeTap App (iOS & Android). You just walk in, find the water station and fill up or ask someone at the counter. The mobile app will even track your water usage.
The really clever part of its model is that business owners are incentivized to join the network because they get free publicity, increased footfall — and here’s the tech part — access to data about how many new customers they are gaining because of the app. Obviously, people with the bottles are more likely to choose a GiveMeTap venue and purchase other goods there.
The app uses geofencing to confirm the locations and to help with seamless checkins. It also includes a discounts system for people who refill their bottles at cafes; helping cafes attract new customers. For every X number of refills (set by the business owner), the consumers get an offer from the store which can be redeemed. When a bottle owner redeems the offer, the business can judge the incremental value of GiveMeTap and tie that into any sales uplift.
The model sounds pretty good but it gets even better: While consumers get free water, a portion of each bottle sale goes to help give clean water to a person in Africa for five years. So, this is not dissimilar to the Toms shoes model, but for water bottles. And this is even a for-profit business, not a charity.
Each time you refill the bottle, GiveMeTap donates an additional day of clean water to a person in Africa via its partners. It also gives 20% from the sale of each bottle to Pronet, their water NGO partner in Ghana, who has been installing water pumps in Ghana for over 25 years.
It’s also just partnered with several tech startups in SF as part of a new B2B programme “This swag saves lives”. Companies get their logo on the bottle and the bottles get used and carried around: so more free advertising.
Despite it graduating from YC, GiveMeTap is not a brand-new startup. Starting in 2013, it was the first water refill network in the UK and ended up scaling to over 630 cafes/restaurants, including Pizza Hut, selling over 40,000 GiveMeTap bottles. Assuming none of the buyers ever buy more plastic bottles, that would translate to roughly 6 million fewer plastic bottles in landfills, and provide 5,334 people in Africa with clean drinking water for life.
In January this year, the startup expanded into San Francisco, sold over 1,000 bottles and now have 160 GiveMeTap locations in the city.
In theory, if all GiveMeTap bottles took over form plastic bottles sold in the US, they’d take out around 50 billion bottles a year (worth about $1 Billion a year). Only 23 percent plastic bottles are actually recycled.
You can get the water bottles either online or from a stockist. All GiveMeTap bottles are 18/8 Food-grade stainless steel and 100% free of toxins, BPA, phthalate and PVC. The bottles cost $18-20 and come in 2 sizes (16 oz and 23 oz) and 4 different colours (Blue, Black, Hot Pink, Silver).
GiveMeTap is also poised to take advantage of local government’s war on waste and costs. San Francisco has now banned plastic water bottles at public events and spaces, which is similar to the plastic bottle ban in Massachusetts and across several university campuses. The reusable water bottle market is estimated to be worth $1.5 billion and is the fastest-growing consumer durables product.
GiveMeTap was founded by Edwin Broni-Mensah, a former Quant Analyst inside investment banks. He came up with the GiveMeTap idea after going on a fitness regime which required him to “get ripped in 90 days” by drinking four to five litres of water a day during exercising.
The irony is that Broni-Mensah’s father was originally from Ghana, where water is a pretty scarce commodity.

412,Elon Musk Says Tesla Model S ‘Range Anxiety’ Will End With A Software Update,https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/15/elon-musk-says-tesla-model-s-range-anxiety-will-end-with-a-software-update/,2015/03/15,"
Elon Musk has teased something big coming from Tesla this week – an end to ‘range anxiety.’ The Model S (and every other electric vehicle), Tesla’s current flagship, has been known to inspire so-called range anxiety, wherein a driver spends a lot of time worrying about when they’ll next be able to get a full charge, and consequently don’t often drive anywhere near the upper limit of their battery’s range.


Tesla press conf at 9am on Thurs. About to end range anxiety … via OTA software update. Affects entire Model S fleet.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 15, 2015



Musk’s tweet promises more info a Thursday 9AM PT press conference around how a coming software update for the Tesla S will “end range anxiety.” The Tesla S has already accrued some impressive new abilities via software update, including an acceleration speed boost for its P85D.
To fight range anxiety, Tesla has already invested in a network of high-speed supercharger stations across the U.S., and introduced a pilot program to test the feasibility of swapping out physical batteries in just a few minutes for around the cost of a tank of gas.
This update could either be a way more intelligently manage the existing power available to Tesla S vehicles to significantly extend range, but it seems more like it will offer some improved way to deal with the existing limitations on car battery tech. Either way, we’ll know more Thursday at 9 AM PT.

413,Vanhawks Raises $1.6M To Help Put The Valour Smartbike On The Road,https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/04/vanhawks-raises-1-6m-to-help-put-the-valour-smartbike-on-the-road/,2015/03/04,"
Smartbike startup Vanhawks, part of the Y Combinator Winter 2015 class, has raised $1.6 million from Real Ventures, Olympic triathlon gold medallist Simon Whitfield, Brenda Irwin of Relentless Pursuit partners and various angels. The company will use the funding to help deliver its Valour smartbike, which raised over $820,000 on Kickstarter last year, to its first customers starting this spring. The funding will help the startup overcome some of the challenges it encountered going from concept to full production in Taiwan, and set the company up for future growth plans, which include becoming category leaders in bike-based software.
Vanhawks co-founder Ali Zahid explained in an interview that the startup wasn’t surprised that it needed more funds to start shipping over and above what it raised on Kickstarter, since they were first-time entrepreneurs and didn’t know exactly what to expect when it came time for actual production and manufacturing. Despite missing their initial launch target of late last year for shipping the first Valour bikes out to Kickstarter backers, Zahid says they’re pleased with how things are going now and will start shipping in batches of 25 to 50 bikes at a time this spring, with the intent of working through the backlog by this summer and then offering two- to three-week delivery times on new orders. The funding also helps with the company’s long-term strategy, which extends beyond making bikes.
“The vision is a lot bigger than just making bikes,” Zahid explains. “Think of us as the software layer for the bike industry of the future. Everyone says that software is eating the world, and we see that in the bike industry, too, which has been sitting in the past.”

Zahid thinks this is the right time for someone (ideally Vanhawks) to emerge as the connected pioneer for the biking industry, which he expects to explode in the coming years. He points out that in Europe and elsewhere in the world, bikes are an incredibly popular mode of transportation, and he expects that adoption of bikes in North America will grow to match. Biking among city-dwellers has been on the rise in North America among commuters, especially between 1990 and 2011, so in urban centers at least Vanhawks has a growing user base to target.
The Valour will showcase what Vanhawks’ software can offer bikes in terms of software, showcasing built-in turn-by-turn and blind spot detection, as well as speed tracking, road condition reports, distance and elevation, all of which helps serve a Waze-like crowdsourced route planning service for fellow bike commuters. The software also enables anti-theft tracking measures, which helps to alleviate a primary concern especially among riders who invest considerable money, time and effort into their bicycles.
I like biking, and while part of the reason I like it is because it requires my full attention and essentially ensures that I can’t be glued to some kind of data feed, I see plenty of opportunity for passive data gathering that can better equip a future of connected two-wheel commuters. The Valour is cool, but long-term, as with most tech startups, the data will probably be the bigger story here.

414,"Apple Adds Vehicles To Its List Of Activities In Switzerland, Tim Cook Demurs On Car Rumors",https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/02/apple-adds-vehicles-to-its-list-of-activities-in-switzerland-tim-cook-demurs-on-car-rumors/,2015/03/02,"
Apple has added language to legal documents (via 9to5Mac) regarding the scope of its company activities to include vehicles, with a generic description that includes automobiles, bicycles, rail, ships, aircraft and more. The specific details aren’t that important, and these are usually made as broad as possible to provide ample legal cover, but the fact that Apple’s lawyers have deemed it worthy of addition at all lends more evidence to the growing body that suggests it has indeed begun work on prototyping a car.
The description in the company’s legal document follows reports of significant hires, in particular of people with expertise in building car hardware and components. Other reports have claimed a target of 2020 for a target launch date for an Apple vehicle, and reported that Apple’s car ambitions have sparked a hiring war between it and electric automobile maker Tesla.
One person, at least, still hasn’t chimed in on the rumors and reports: Apple CEO Tim Cook. The company’s chief executive has spoken to German newspaper BILD, and was asked directly about the subject of Apple’s automotive plans. Cook’s answer to a question about the Apple Car was simply to state that he’s “read the rumors,” and that he “can’t comment on it.”
Typically, Apple rumors either die out or gain more legitimacy as time goes by – at this point, there’s plenty of smoke to indicate some kind of actual fire, and it’s looking more and more like we’re talking about a real car, rather than internal systems, accessories or a software platform. We probably have at least another half-decade before we get those efforts confirmed, but making a full-scale vehicle is a large project that’s likely to generate further leaks.

415,This Tesla Model S Easter Egg Lets You Be James Bond,https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/01/tesla-model-s-james-bond-lotus-esprit/,2015/03/01,"
The Tesla Model S is one helluva car – but it can’t do everything. It can’t recharge as fast as you could fill a tank of gas. It can’t go over 155 miles per hour. Oh, and it can’t transform into a submarine and cruise around underwater.
With this awesome little easter egg, though, that last one becomes a bit less certain…
You see, Elon Musk is a bit of a James Bond fan.
Specifically, he’s a fan of Bond’s submersible Lotus Esprit from 1977’s The Spy Who Loved Me — so much so, in fact, that he dropped nearly a million dollars in an auction for the movie prop. His eventual goal? To convert the prop (which, sadly, doesn’t do much besides look cool) into an actual, functional submersible vehicle.
In a nod to this, Tesla engineers have hidden a most excellent easter egg within the Model S’ 17-inch touchscreen. Check it out:

Note that there’s a Jules Verne nod in there, too, with one of the “Depth” options being “20,000 leagues” — as in 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea.
For comparison’s sake, here’s what that screen usually looks like:

And here’s the Bond scene that inspired it all:

(Note: This doesn’t actually make the Model S a submersible, so please don’t drive that $80,000 car into the ocean. Also, anti-aircraft missiles are not included.)

416,SolarCity Creates $750M Fund For Residential Solar With $300M From Google,https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/26/solarcity-creates-750m-fund-for-residential-solar-with-300m-from-google/,2015/02/26,"
SolarCity, the solar power startup whose chairman is the seemingly ever-present Elon Musk, has announced a new $750 million fund created to help fund residential solar projects, including defraying the upfront costs of solar panel installation at homes in 14 different states across the U.S. and in D.C. The new fund includes a contribution of $300 million, or just under half the total value, from Google, which marks its largest clean energy investment to date, and helps make this the biggest fund of its kind in existence.
Typically, installation costs associated with making an individual household able to harvest and use its own solar power are very high, meaning they take many years to recoup for the homeowners funding the installations. That means there’s a high barrier preventing many from taking advantage, especially if homeowners think they might have cause to move before they make their money back on the initial build.
The new $750 million fund is designed to help “thousands” of homeowners defray those setup costs, covering the cost of installation, solar panels, and equipment. In exchange, homeowners pay SolarCity for the energy produced by their panels, or a monthly rent fee for the panels in a lease situation, similar to the arrangement they’d have with a typical utility company, but with cleaner energy, and, in most cases, lower costs, too.
This is the second time Google and SolarCity have teamed up in this way; back in 2011, Google committed $280 million to a similar fund with the aim of getting thousands of homeowners on board with solar power. Clearly that had satisfactory results, since the search giant is going back for more.

417,Y Combinator-Backed Bright Aims To Bring Solar Power To Mexico,https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/25/y-combinator-backed-bright-aims-to-bring-solar-power-to-mexico/,2015/02/25,"
Jonah Greenberger envisions Mexico’s rooftops covered in cost-effective, environmentally friendly, dark blue solar panels. The 28-year-old founder of Y Combinator-backed solar power startup Bright left his job working in fossil fuels at Chevron to work on lowering exorbitant energy costs for the people of Mexico.
“The third world pays the most for electricity. Mexico has the most potential to be disrupted because it’s really sunny there,” he told me over the phone.
The electric system in Mexico is both expensive and complicated. The government subsidizes the poorest people, and the wealthier citizens end up paying the most. Fees can get up to over $4,000 USD in the hot month of August when not subsidized, according to the Mexican Federal Electric Commission.
Solar energy could lower power bills by 20 to 50 percent per household, according to Bright. It works by installing the panels for free and then providing a subscription service similar to what we do here for cable television. Private investors purchase the solar panels and front the installation costs. The investors then lease the use of the panels to the homeowner. The investor makes their money back on the power generated from the panels.
Jonah Greenberger, Bright Founder
Y Combinator tends to take on co-founding teams. Greenberger is an unusual choice as a sole founder. But it seems the idea for Bright was enticing enough to bring him into the batch.
“I think that inexpensive sources of planet-friendly energy are one of the most important things for us to pursue,” Y Combinator president Sam Altman said in regards to why he chose Bright. “The correlation of quality of life and cost of energy is huge.  Also, Jonah’s first market seemed like a very good decision, and we think energy businesses that innovate on financing are interesting.”
Bright competes with one other solar provider in Mexico called Envolta. This company both builds and installs the panels and then finances them to customers. Bright doesn’t build the panels itself. Instead, it leverages a large contractor system in Mexico to install ready-made panels. Both companies ultimately own and then lease the panels to customers.
It seems a no-brainer to install something that won’t cost a dime and will lower your energy bill a ton. However, it’s not all sunshine. Bright needs to make sure the households that agree to installation will actually pay up each month. But the country has existed on a mostly cash system up until the last few years. That means there’s not a lot of repayment history to go on. Bright compensates for that with a built-in software system that pulls in data where it can find it from government systems and public databases.
I think that inexpensive sources of planet-friendly energy are one of the most important things for us to pursue.— Sam Altman
The startup says it’s currently doing about one installation a day and believes it will hit 50 installations by demo day. That doesn’t seem like a lot when compared to app downloads, but to Greenberger that number is right on target to start netting the fledgling startup a six-figure profit by the end of the year.
One installation costs an investor about $10,000 to $20,000, depending on the contractor and area. Households then start to pay Bright about $250 per month on average for the use of power. Bright splits that payment with the private investor.
Households are allowed, based on the Bright contract, to cancel the service at any time. Should they do that, the investor may take a loss. Greenberger says this means Bright needs to carefully select those households that are the least likely to do that in order to lower risk for investors.
Greenberger would like to eventually build out the software so that it is easy for private investors and contractors to sell the service directly themselves. Though Mexico seemed the most profitable first choice to him, he also mentioned plans to expand into Chile and Brazil next.

418,Apple Accused Of Poaching Auto Engineers For Advanced Battery Division,https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/19/apple-accused-of-poaching-auto-engineers-for-advanced-battery-division/,2015/02/19,"
Apple is said to be building a new battery division that competes directly with a firm that builds lithium-ion batteries for cars and other large vehicles, in a new lawsuit that accuses Apple of poaching engineers from said firm in order to build said division. Battery maker A123 Systems has filed court documents related to the new suit that say Apple has been aggressively pursuing its project-leading engineers, to the extent that the beleaguered A123 Systems (it filed for bankruptcy protection in 2012) has had to shut down some of the projects they’d been leading.
Reuters reports that Apple is accused in the suit of building a “battery division that is similar if not identical to A123’s,” and it also suggests Apple was also looking to hire away battery engineers from LG, Samsung, Panasonic, Toshiba and more. Apple has also hired engineers with car-making expertise from Tesla, which helped kick off the round of rumors and reports regarding Apple’s potential plans of eventually building an electric vehicle of its very own.
As Reuters notes, a total of 11 former A123 engineers now claim Apple as their current employer on LinkedIn, which suggests that there has indeed been a tide of talent moving from the battery maker to the Cupertino-based company. A123’s lawsuit does not specifically claim that Apple’s intent is to build cars or car tech specifically, but the company’s background does suggest that’s a very real possibility.
On the other hand, Apple hiring experts with experience in lithium-ion battery tech makes sense regardless of whether or not it’s used in cars. And given the current state of affairs at A123 Systems, it’s not surprising that its most employable employees would be seeking opportunities elsewhere, with Apple obviously presenting an extremely attractive option. The validity of A123’s claims rely on the fact that it says the employees named in its suit were in violation of their employment agreements in jumping ship, however.
The suit itself isn’t surprising, and likely won’t end up causing much of a stir in terms of its eventual result. But as further evidence that Apple is gearing up with experts in manufacturers of large lithium-ion batteries, including those that power cars, this is indeed an intriguing development.

419,"Apple Has Hundreds Working On An Electric Car Design, Says WSJ",https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/13/apple-car/,2015/02/13,"
Apple is working on a car, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Mac maker kicked off a top-secret project to develop an electric car with a minivan aesthetic, per the WSJ’s sources, after CEO Tim Cook approved the project nearly a year ago. It includes “hundreds” of staffers and is led by Ford Motor vet and Apple VP Steve Zadesky. The project involves research into battery tech, robotics and metal production, according to the paper.
The report comes hot on the heels of a Financial Times story confirming Apple R&D efforts around car tech, and goes further than either that report or an earlier one from Business Insider wherein an Apple employee reportedly confirmed some kind of car-focused project. As I wrote earlier, it makes perfect logical sense that Apple would focus some effort on this area, given the direction in which the tech industry in general is headed.
Apple has allotted for as many as 1,000 people to work on the project, according to the newest report, and the team includes former Mercedez-Benz head of R&D Johann Jungwirth. The fact that Apple’s target in this case is an electric vehicle means earlier reports that it is seeking employees from Tesla (at the same time as Tesla is attempting to poach employees from Cupertino) make a lot of sense.
The WSJ, like the FT, reports that while design and research are underway, Apple still hasn’t decided on any kind of firm product release plans. Apple has also been rumored to have been working on various other product categories in the past, including an Apple television set, which never ended up as shipping products (or haven’t yet shipped, at least).
That isn’t to say Apple will never make a car, but the fact remains that this would be a dramatic departure from the company’s core business, with huge risk involved in actually shipping anything and at this point, it’s unclear how much they’d stand to gain from such a move.
Gross margins on the iPhone range fall just under 50 percent, according to analyst estimates, and Elon Musk has promised (but not necessarily achieved) a 25 percent gross margin on every vehicle. Still, Apple has a track record of achieving premiums unheard of at competitors, so it is conceivable it could find success in the luxury car space, given its expertise with supply-chain management.
Apple also stands to make big gains in a number of other areas even if it ultimately doesn’t ship any cars – research into making a vehicle includes research about how to build software for a car, and has benefits with regards to battery and materials tech. Money spent on R&D for a car (especially an EV), therefore, even if you don’t ship a car, doesn’t go to waste.
One more thing: With the Apple Watch, Apple is clearly interested in seeing how it can extend its reputation and a premium device-maker into other categories, and it’s approaching that market as a fashion brand rather than as a straightforward gadget-maker. Car research could be another step in the same direction, with Apple exploring how its brand might translate to premium goods beyond just the home computing market.

420,The i-Road Is Toyota’s Latest Crack At Envisioning A Post-Car Vehicle,https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/11/the-i-road-is-toyotas-latest-crack-at-envisioning-a-post-car-vehicle/,2015/02/11," 



Every few years, auto-giant Toyota rolls out its latest idea for the future of “personal mobility” — pods that promise to take you from point A to point B with little excitement but lots of practicality. These rides often drive themselves, take up very little space, run on electricity, and let you catch up on stories saved to Pocket while you drive to meet a colleague for lunch.
This year, Toyota went in a slightly different direction. At a makeshift test track in a parking lot in San Jose, I got to take a test drive of the i-Road, a vehicle that fits a person and their bag (or a small child) and combines the ride characteristics of a miniature car and a motorcycle.

At first glance, the i-Road kind of looks like a Smart Car that someone put into a garbage compactor. It’s short, has a single door on each side, and just tall enough to accommodate someone of my size (I’m about six feet tall).
But the i-Road isn’t just a tiny four-wheeled vehicle. Up front, it has two wheels that extrude from the body which move to let the i-Road lean into a turn in the same way that a motorcycle leans with your weight. In the back there’s a third wheel that points straight forward at high speeds, but rotates to allow for very tight control at low speeds, perfect for wedging into that tricky parking spot.
It might be an exaggeration to say that i-Road reaches “high speeds,” as it caps out around 37 miles per hour. That’s not to say it isn’t fun to drive — during my laps in the i-Road I caught myself leaning into sharp turns, an odd sensation considering most enclosed vehicles actively push you *out* from experiencing G-forces. The minimal noise insulation also means you’re going to hear a lot of road noise and whirring from the electric motor. You’re not going to zip between cars on the interstate in the i-Road, but you certainly won’t be bored during your commute.

The i-Road is still very much a prototype, with some units in testing in dense urban markets like Tokyo. Toyota representatives on-site for our test drive compared its future niche to that of Toyota’s currently-available COMS, which sells for about $7-8,000 and is typically purchased for use in delivery fleets and to individuals who don’t want to deal with inclement weather on a moped. The i-Road certainly seems more than capable of fulfilling those roles, with the added benefit of not looking/driving like a high-end golf kart.

This is the third time SpaceX has attempted to launch the DSCOVR, a satellite designed to go about four times further from the earth than the moon, and then provide whole-disc imagery of Earth, as well as warnings of extreme reactions from the sun that might be able to knock out power grids and communications. Advance warning could help people prepare in the case of extreme solar storms.
SpaceX is targeting a launch window starting at 6:03 PM ET as the earliest possible lift-off point, after scrubbing a launch on Sunday evening due to a radar glitch, and cancelling one yesterday as well due to high winds. The launch was supposed to include a try at recovering the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket via autonomous drone ship, but huge waves in the Atlantic mean that will have to wait for another day.
Check out the launch live above, with streaming video from Cape Canaveral kicking off soon.

We are fairly proud of our mastery of nature, but occasionally it can remind us that no matter how many billions, nor how many autonomous drone cargo ships we throw at it, it can still thwart our great designs. SpaceX is still aiming to launch DSCOVR, an observatory satellite, later today, but the  first-stage rocket recovery attempt that was planned along with that mission has been sadly scrubbed, owing to nature’s wrath.
In a brief update, SpaceX said that while it still plans to launch DSCOVR during a launch window that kicks off at 6:03 PM ET today (after scrapping two previous attempts Sunday and Tuesday), its planned recovery attempt for the reusable first stage of Falcon 9’s rocket won’t be part of the mission. SpaceX has retrofitted a huge seafaring vessel with autonomous smarts that let it hold its position in the ocean to within 3 meters, providing a stable landing pad for the stage 1 rocket, but the drone ship can’t handle the three-story swells currently afflicting the Atlantic Ocean. The drone ship is working on only three of four engines due to a malfunction, making any attempt to thread the needle on those huge waves inconceivable.

SpaceX’s launch today is still exciting, but the Falcon 9 rocket recovery was a more important part of the mission for Elon Musk’s spacefaring startup. A previous attempt resulted in a dramatic explosion thanks to a shortage of hydraulic fluid, but that was the closest the company has yet come to getting its rocket back to ground safely. Proving the viability of its reusable rocket recovery system is extremely important to SpaceX’s long-term vision of more affordable, efficient spaceflight. SpaceX says that while they’ll try to do a soft landing in water with today’s launch, survival isn’t expected based on the extreme sea conditions. They should still garner useful landing data from the attempt, however.
Musk is probably already hard at work solving for brownstone-sized waves with the drone landing pad design, so hopefully this won’t happen again.

423,Apple Will Spend $848 Million Building A Massive Solar Farm In Monterey,https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/10/apple-will-spend-848-million-building-a-massive-solar-farm-in-monterey/,2015/02/10,"
Tim Cook dropped a bit of news in a conversation at the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet conference today: Apple is putting a massive $848 million into solar energy.
According to Cook, Apple is putting $848 million into building a 1,300-acre solar farm in Monterey, Calif., in partnership with Arizona-based First Solar. As part of the deal, Apple will get electricity from the farm at a fixed rate for 25 years.
The power they’re getting from the farm, says Cook, should be enough to power Apple’s new campus, its existing California offices, and all of its California retail stores.
Construction on the solar farm is expected to begin in mid-2015, and it should be finished by the end of 2016.

424,Stella’s Solar Car Wins The Crunchie For Best Technology Achievement,https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/05/stellas-solar-car-wins-the-crunchie-for-best-technology-achievement/,2015/02/05,"
The best tech for 2014 is getting its just desserts at the 8th Annual Crunchies right now, and Best Technology Achievement is one of the categories that reflects true excellence in a field where it’s easy to identify standouts. This year’s winner is Stella, whose four-seat, solar-powered car won the World Solar Challenge and is designed to be a functional family vehicle instead of a tech demo or high-speed racer.
Stella’s car uses a roof-mounted solar panel that can provide enough power to move the car 500 miles on a full charge of the battery, which is considerably more than the max mileage of a Tesla Model S. Stella is the product of a team-up between the Eindhoven University of Technology and NXP Semiconductors, and it actually manages to produce twice the energy it consumes through its photovoltaic energy system.



Not only was Stella a showcase for clean energy, it was also a means to demonstrate new vehicle-to-vehicle communications systems that could eventually allow cars to work together to determine the best speeds to drive in order to keep traffic moving efficiently.
Stella’s crowning achievement in 2014 was making the trek up Highway 1 between L.A. and San Francisco, producing zero emissions along the way.
Runner-up this year was Apple Pay, a very different technological achievement but one that’s no less likely to become truly disruptive. Apple’s mobile payments play debuted this year with a software update released in October for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. It quickly became one of the most-used electronic payment methods on the market, with new financial institutions and retail partners coming on board all the time.

425,Apple To Build A $2 Billion Data Command Center In Arizona,https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/02/apple-to-build-a-2-billion-data-command-center-in-arizona/,2015/02/02,"
Apple will build a $2 billion global command center located in Mesa, Arizona, the company revealed on Monday (via CNBC). It will employ 150 full-time personnel, and will also result in between 300 and 500 construction and trade jobs, and will play host to the company’s data operations across the globe.
Apple’s arrangement involves repurposing a facility that previously housed GT Advanced Technologies facilities, which was an Apple supply partner involved in the production of sapphire glass materials that declared bankruptcy last year. Apple had acquired the 1.3 million sq ft facility back in 2013 to lease to GTAT for its sapphire supply facilities, which were to be exclusively for Apple’s benefit. Apple’s investment includes a pledge to power the new facility completely using energy derived from renewable sources, which is in keeping with its commitment to green power, and as part of the project the company will be building out new solar collection facilities.
As part of its bankruptcy arrangement with GTAT over outstanding debt, Apple had agreed to acquire some of the failed company’s assets, and it already owned the land it had intended to lease to GTAT for expansion. Apple has increasing requirements for cloud and data management, of course, owing to the increased importance of said services to both its desktop and mobile platforms, as well as iCloud.com.
The repurposing of the Mesa, Arizona facility seems like a move inspired by negative circumstances that turns into opportunity for most of those involved – Apple gets something to do with property it already purchased, as well as a new HQ for its growing data business, while Arizona gets a renewed commitment to employment and the local Mesa economy.
Apple’s existing data centres are all running entirely on renewable energy, which includes facilities in the Bay Area and in North Carolina, and Oregon, as well as a new facility opened lat year outside of Reno, Nevada. Apple’s MO when powering new facility is to build or buy new clean energy sources that are entirely additive to the grid, and solar is its preferred tech, so the new solar facilities it aims to build are another net benefit resulting from the arrangement.
Apple plans to build enough solar power to supply around 14,500 homes, we’ve learned, which prompted Greenpeace to laud its efforts on this particular project. A statement from the organization’s Senior IT Sector Analyst Gary Cook explains the potential local impact:
Arizona has some of the best solar potential in the world – yet Arizona utilities and policy makers have been slow to tap the economic potential of solar, and some are still trying to slow the growth of solar. If the Salt River Project can work with Apple to help it power its operations with solar energy, it can surely work with the thousands of Arizona residents and businesses who want to do the same thing. Apple’s announcement today should encourage policy makers, regulators, and utilities in Arizona to tap into the state’s huge potential for solar, and turn this resource into an economic driver for growth.
In a statement provided to TechCrunch, Apple explained both the scale of the project and he environmental benefits of the upcoming facility.
We’re proud to continue investing in the U.S. with a new data center in Arizona, which will serve as a command center for our global networks. This multi-billion dollar project is one of the largest investments we’ve ever made, and when completed it will add over 600 engineering and construction jobs to the more than one million jobs Apple has already created in the U.S.  Like all Apple data centers, it will be powered by 100 percent renewable energy, much of which will come from a new local solar farm.

426,Nest Touts Three Studies Claiming Its Thermostat Pays For Itself In Two Years,https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/02/nest-touts-three-studies-claiming-its-thermostat-pays-for-itself-in-two-years/,2015/02/02,"
Google-subsidiary Nest claims that the results of three studies based on longitudinal data show that its thermostat pays for itself in less than two years from savings from heating and cooling costs.
The studies were funded and implemented separately by the Energy Trust of Oregon, Indiana-based utility Vectren, and Nest itself. Averaged together, they claim that the Nest thermostat’s automatic temperature management reduces heating costs by 10-12 percent, and cooling costs by 15 percent.
Bill Bixby, Nest’s General Manager of Energy Services, says that “if you factor the average American’s utility bills into the equation, that means savings of $131-145 per year.” At $249 for a Nest Thermostat, that means you make up for the initial investment in less than two years.
Together, these three studies confirm what has long been a marketing bullet point for Nest: the idea that by cutting off the AC when you leave for work during the summer or turn on the heat while you drive home, it can cut your energy bills while keeping you comfortable. On its site, Nest claims “A correctly programmed thermostat can save about 20% on your heating and cooling bill,” which it says translates to $173 in savings.
Bixby says there are further opportunities for Nest to reduce people’s power usage. For one thing, as the company’s thermostats gather more usage data, the algorithms that decide how to adjust settings get better at responding to changes in temperature and anticipating future usage. With MyEnergy, Nest users can also look at the data from their power bills in a more understandable way and challenge friends to use less power.
As more companies partner up to make appliances around Nest APIs as part of the Works With Nest program, there will be more data for the company to draw from as each sensor gives the system a better idea of whether you’re home and if not, how long it will be until you get back. Just this month, Nest updated its APIs to allow appliance makers to show a product’s electricity, water, and gas use in the monthly Nest Energy Report so users can easily get a better idea of how their entire household affects the utility bill.

427,The Storm eBike Is A $499 Entry-Level Electric Bike,https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/01/the-storm-ebike-is-a-499-entry-level-electric-bike/,2015/02/01," 



It’s been a while since I got to do a fun demo on some kind of electric vehicle, so last week we took a trip to Golden Gate Park with the Storm eBike.
It’s a electric bicycle designed to be cheap and practical. It’s the 1987 Honda Civic of electric bikes, stripped down to the basics. There’s no regenerative braking, or a fancy housing to disguise the massive batteries needed to give bikes any kind of range for commuting.
While the frame isn’t anything special, the tires that come with the bike certainly draw the eye. They’re big round tubes that probably aren’t doing the motor any favors but provide a stable, smooth ride on different surfaces. Going over pavement with cracks, paths with crunchy branch bits, and dirt the bike maintained a solid grip and could instantly get going with a push of the accelerator.

I didn’t get a chance to test the Storm eBike for the entirety of its battery life, but I did get to drive on a few different grades of hill to see how it performed. If your commute is mostly flat (or if you just want to take it to the beach sometimes), it offers a fun ride with assistance that’s also not too hard to pedal.
If you live in an area with particularly steep slopes, the Storm won’t completely eliminate the struggle. I had to max out the accelerator and pedal a bit to get up a hill that I probably wouldn’t have struggled with too much on a lighter bike without a battery.
Storm says that the bike can go 30 miles on a 90 minute charge. While the total distance available will likely drop off a bit over a few years of use, the quick charge time means it’ll still be practical if your trips regularly take you somewhere with an outlet for topping off.
At its $499 launch price on Indiegogo, the Storm eBike seems like a solid entry-level option. Comparable bikes I’ve tried cost a few hundred dollars more, and if you really do want things like fancy industrial design and regenerative braking, you generally have to pony up well over $1,000. It seems ideal for those suburban commuters who could either bike or drive to work — this would certainly make cycling the preferable option.

428,Tesla Model X Caught On Video At The Test Track,https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/30/tesla-model-x-caught-on-video-at-the-test-track/,2015/01/30,"

A new model Tesla has been caught on camera at the Alameda Airport test track (via Electrek). The car looks pretty similar to a Prius, or perhaps a crossover utility vehicle, and could plausibly be either the Model X SUV Tesla has been working on for years, or, as others are arguing, a prototype of the mass-market Model 3 that the coming is planning to bring to market in the $35,000 price range.
The video doesn’t show much beyond a car driving around at a relatively high speeds both straight and through some wide loops, and the camouflaged body of the vehicle with a broad back end and what looks like a fairly high seating arrangement for the driver, which does suggest it’s a Model X test vehicle. It also has a lot in common in terms of design, body shape and apparent size with the original Tesla Model X design unveiled in 2013 by Elon Musk.

I think it’s most likely this is the Model X, because of the points raised above, and because Tesla CEO Elon Musk said earlier this month that the Model X is on track for release by the early part of the second half of 2015, meaning it should be about as road ready and design-final as the vehicle in this spy video is. That means it’s time for electric car fans who want a bit more cargo capacity to get excited.

429,UK Regulator Sets Out Priorities For Growing The Internet Of Things,https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/27/ofcom-iot-priorities/,2015/01/27,"
The U.K.’s telecoms regulator Ofcom has identified four areas it plans to prioritize in order to support the development of the Internet of Things, after taking input from various industry “stakeholders” last year.
“Ofcom’s plan is to ensure the U.K. has the tools and infrastructure to allow the IoT to develop unhindered,” it said today, noting there are already more than 40 million devices connected via the IoT in the country — a figure that’s forecast to grow more than 8x by 2022.
“We have listened closely to industry and want to develop a framework for this technology to evolve in a way which will ultimately benefit citizens and consumers,” it added.
Future large-scale applications for IoT technology which Ofcom points to as having the potential for various benefits — such as reduced costs, lower pollution, increased efficiency — include smart farming, for automating crop irrigation and feeding; smart energy grids that can match energy generation from multiple power generation sources with changing demand; telemedicine and remote care for monitoring patients and the frail elderly; and intelligent transport systems to better manage traffic.
The four priority areas the regulator intends to focus on to foster IoT growth are:

Spectrum availability
Data privacy
Network security and resilience
Network addressing

On the networks side, Ofcom noted the IoT will inevitably increase reliance on secure and reliable data networks and data storage — so that’s a clear priority area for fostering growth. Along with IPv6, given that the latest comms protocol best supports multiple connections.
It noted:
IoT services will likely use bespoke addressing systems or addresses based on the internet standard known as IPv6, the latest version of the Internet Protocol which is able to support connections between a significantly greater number of devices. To support this, Ofcom will continue to monitor the progress already being made by internet service providers in supporting IPv6 connectivity.
On the spectrum point, Ofcom said it believes IoT demand will be met by current provision in the “medium-term” but intends to monitor this to identify whether additional spectrum might be needed.
The regulator has already released some spectrum for short range devices, and has also been pushing for the launch of licence-exempt white spaces spectrum in the U.K. to be used, in part, for machine-to-machine comms. Various trials using this type of spectrum are underway, with a possible rollout this year — although that launch timeline was previously pegged for late 2013 (so evidently hasn’t been considered hugely pressing at this nascent stage).
On the data privacy point, the regulator dubbed the protection of individuals’ personal data as “a key part of the development of the IoT” — given, presumably, the potential for widespread consumer mistrust of connected devices — and asserts that this will be covered under existing legislation, such as the Data Protection Act 1998.
However it also raised concerns that there may be additional requirements when it comes to regulating the IoT, noting:
…traditional approaches to data privacy may have limitations in the context of the IoT. Ofcom will work with the Information Commissioner’s Office, government, other regulators and industry to explore solutions to data privacy issues in the IoT.
Ofcom is not alone in picking up on changing privacy concerns relating to the IoT. Earlier this month, in the U.S., the consumer-focused FTC set out detailed concerns about consumer privacy challenges posed by the collective impact of connected devices, and suggested some specific best practice measures that IoT companies should adopt — such as security by design; practicing data minimization; and increasing consumer transparency about data usage and re-usage. Update: The FTC has also today released a detailed report expanding on these privacy best practices for businesses in the IoT space.
In the U.K. the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) has the primary duty for privacy issues, so it’s not for Ofcom to set out such detailed measures here. But it looks to be positioning itself to adopt a facilitating role between various government and industry stakeholders — to keep IoT development ticking along.
What’s likely to be a key piece of work for these regulatory and data protection bodies is figuring out how comprehensively existing data protection regulations encompass the IoT. And coming up with a core framework to govern data sharing within an increasingly dense data-generating landscape of multiple networked objects.
Understanding consumer attitudes and considering how best to educate people so they can make informed decisions about how much data they share are also likely to become pressing considerations as the IoT proliferates.

430,Scientists Make Energy-Generating Keyboard That Knows Who’s Typing On It,https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/21/touch-sensing-energy-generating-keyboard/,2015/01/21,"
Passwords continue to be a glaring weakness in digital security. And while biometric alternatives, such as fingerprint readers, are finding their way onto more consumer electronics devices, they are not without their limitations either. So what about tightening the security screw further by applying a continuous biometric — such as a keyboard that knows who’s typing on it in real-time and could lock out an intruder based on sensing unfamiliar keystrokes?
A team of scientists including from the Georgia Institute of Tech and research labs in China have developed just such a prototype device. As well as sensing touch and typing style, the non-mechanical keyboard is able to generate energy to power itself, and self cleans, thanks to a dirt repellent coating and crafty composition — thin layers of plastic, topped and tailed with conductive film — so there’s no mechanical gullies to harvest the crumbs of your lunch. The low profile keys have a top electrification layer that allows them to generate charge from typing friction (aka contact electrification) — so the keyboard is able to register individual keystroke data and track typing style, or to harness typing friction to generate electrical charge for powering other devices.
“The keyboard identify the force and speed at which the typer input characters. This is not available in today’s cell phone at all. The keyboard can identify personality in information input so that it is a high level of security,” Zhong Lin Wang, one of the scientists involved in the research, told TechCrunch. “The power generated can automatically send signals to the computer so that no power is needed for the keyboard.”
In a paper detailing the research project, called Personalized Keystroke Dynamics for Self-Powered Human–Machine Interfacing — published in the ACSNano journal — the scientists argue that algorithms which can identify who is typing by analyzing keystroke timing are more limited than their hardware-based approach of “typing-induced electric signals”, as the latter is also able to sense pressure, as well as speed and strike timing.
They write:

…keystroke dynamics has developed rather slowly and is still at its very early stage, partially because almost all of the proposed studies rely on dimensional keystroke timing vectors as typing patterns, which can only communicate the keystroke timing characteristics, thus rendering this biometric measure lacking in universality, uniqueness, permanence, accuracy, and acceptability… A breakthrough is desperately needed to obtain a unique and permanent typing pattern that can be used as an effective identifier/calibration for practical applications. In this work, the typing-induced electric signals can not only differentiate keystroke timing but also quantitatively record concrete dynamic changes in the course of typing using the self-generated electric current and voltage signals. It offers an unprecedentedly accurate, unique, and permanent typing pattern for further verification and recognition purposes.
 …

First, through integration of the IKB [Intelligent Keyboard] with a signal-processing circuit, a complete touch-sensing system was built up. A wireless alarm is triggered once a finger gently taps on a key. Furthermore, each key is individually addressable, which enables tracing and recording the typing content in real time. This capability will provide administrators with great convenience for identifying impostors or intruders, and it will have extensive applications in keyboard-based information security.


No external power source is required for the keyboard to function, thanks to its self-powering abilities. So it is evidently a more energy-efficient alternative to tracking typing via capacitive data that could be harvested from typing on a touchscreen keyboard.
How much energy can be generated by typing on the smart keyboard? Enough to charge “small electronics at arbitrary typing speed greater than 100 characters per min”, according to the team — which they characterize as “a giant leap compared to previous reports”.
They add:
Given such features as self-securing, self-powering, and self-cleaning, as well as unique applicability resulting from distinctive mechanism and one-piece non-mechanical-punching structure, the IKB presented in this work is a practical approach in converting typing motions for self-powered electronics as well as a milestone in the development toward a highly secure behavioral biometrics-based authentication system, which will have extensive applications in the fields of artificial intelligence, cyber security, and computer or network access control.
The U.S. Department of Energy contributed funding to the research. For more details of the research read the full paper in ACSNano.
“The technology is ready for commercialization within a couple of years if some one is willing to invest,” added Zhong.

431,"Inmarsat Courts Developers, Opens Its Satellite Broadband Platform To All",https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/20/inmarsat-open-source/,2015/01/20,"
Inmarsat, the UK-based satellite company that provides voice and broadband services to users in the air and on land and sea, is today announcing that it will open its platform for all developers to access. The move is calculated to help the company expand its services beyond its traditional customer base — businesses and individuals in remote areas that terrestrial networks don’t reach — to a new class of always-connected users and use-cases, such as the rise of the Internet of Things.
“We recognise the constant need for people and things to be connected regardless of time or location. We have been providing global mobile connectivity for decades and want to leverage this position to facilitate the development of new applications, enhancing the way in which people interact with our technologies,” said Michele Franci, Inmarsat’s CTO said in a statement. 
The company is expected to provide more details of its strategy later today at it Developer Conference, the first time that the company is formally opening its doors to third parties in this way. In line with that, Inmarsat is also opening up a new Certified Application Partner program.
In the past, services that would have been developed using Inmarsat’s telecoms backbone would be done in large, formal partnerships. Opening the platform in the way that they are doing will help Inmarsat widen that funnel considerably.
Traditionally, satellite-based communications services have been too expensive to implement on a mass scale. Partly for this reason, Inmarsat and companies like it will often give their services away for free to aid organisations that would otherwise not be able to afford to take communications services in remote areas (it then charges for the services when they are used by, say, media organizations or other large corporations).
More recently, with the implementation of new technologies, the costs for some of these services have been coming down (the price of voice calls are now closer to that of the average price of an international mobile call). That trend is spurring Inmarsat to consider how else it can develop its business in the future to drive more users (purchasers) of those services. It may not ever be much of a direct-to-consumer company, but Inmarsat is launching the new open source initiative to improve its position in the area of B2B2C.
Inmarsat, which is publicly traded in the UK, currently has a market cap of £3.73 billion ($5.6 billion).
Inmarsat says it will focus its first open platform efforts around Global Xpress, a global, Ka-band high-speed broadband network that was created in part to serve the rush of new in-flight broadband being launched by airlines, and in part to serve a wider range of terrestrial customers with fast, but not exorbitantly priced, satellite broadband services.
Now the idea will be to open that network to others so that they can develop services using this capacity too, either for their own broadband offerings, or for other applications and devices that will require data connectivity no matter where the user is. Global Xpress provides download speeds of 60Mbit/s or more to a 60-cm dish.
If prices for Inmarsat’s phone and broadband services continue to go down, it’s interesting to consider what kinds of applications might potentially get created on the platform. The Internet of Things movement, giving everything and anything a IP life so that objects can “communicate” information to each other, is one obvious area. But there are others.
This recent article from Wired about how a small community off the grid in Mexico is building communications using some open source radio hardware points to how companies or non profits can use the platform to develop small-scale services.
And there is also the net neutrality debate to consider. As businesses worry about how their services might potentially get throttled by carriers unhappy with the data strain, one alternative could be considering how you could leave those terrestrial networks altogether, looking instead into the sky to get to your users.

432,Kraftwerk Is A Power Plant That Fits In The Palm Of Your Hand,https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/07/kraftwerk-is-a-power-plant-that-fits-in-the-palm-of-your-hand/,2015/01/07,"
It looks and acts like a battery pack but kraftwerk is actually the first hand-held fuel cell generator that can regenerate energy in less than 3 seconds. And it can power all your mobile devices for weeks.
kraftwerk, which translates to “power station” in German, is the product of eZelleron, an engineering team that spun out of German research firm Fraunhofer Gesellschaft. So far the company has raised almost half its $500,000 goal for kraftwerk in just three days on Kickstarter. Three people have even pledged $10,000 to get distributor rights for the product when it becomes available.

Fuel cell technology has been bandied about since the 1950’s (Wikipedia says the first reference to it was in 1838) but gas and other fossil fuels have eclipsed it as a preferred energy source. The reasons for low adoption of the tech are varied (and it may continue if our current abundance of crude oil keeps up) but it does hold the promise of a cheap, clean and efficient source of energy. It works by converting chemical energy into electricity instead of needing to plug it into the power grid. This means kraftwerk units can be taken all over the world, including vast regions of Earth that aren’t connected to electricity, and your cellphone can get instant, clean power for a long period of time.

There have been a few other fuel cell Kickstarters for powering cellphones, but none look as slick as kraftwerk. The Devotec Micro Fuel Charger, a key ring sized fuel cell cellphone charger, added about 20-30 minutes of extra talk time if plugged in. There was also the unsuccessfully funded HALO fuel cell charger. Touted as emergency preparedness for the outdoorsy type with an iPad, it was a bit clunky looking. But you could charge two devices at the same time on it.
The kraftwerk units come in three different colors, “Urban,” “Outdoor” and “Glam” and run on a short spray of camping gas or standard lighter fluid. This is something you can easily find at most corner stores throughout the world. It will charge anything that can be plugged into a USB cable such as your iPhone, tablet, or even a GoPro. One “filling” supplies power for up to 11 iPhones. Once depleted, the unit will recharge itself in the aforementioned 3 seconds.

433,"Why I’m Excited By The New CO2 Fit App, An App To Get The Planet Fit",https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/05/why-im-excited-by-the-new-co2-fit-app-an-app-to-get-the-planet-fit/,2015/01/05,"
For years I have wondered: Why, if we can measure our fitness, or how many steps we are taking and thus get a measure of our overall health, why can’t we do the same with the environment? Why can’t someone create an app which “gamifies” us into cycling rather than driving, or taking a train or just generally pump less CO2 into the atmosphere, and creating global weirding? If we can create an addiction to Clash of Clans, why can’t we create an addiction to saving the planet?
Now a startup has made the first step in what I hope will become a really powerful platform.
Green tech startup Changers has launched CO2 Fit, a mobile app (available for iPhone and Android) that encourage fitness, rewards green behaviour, and – hopefully – will motivate you to reduce your CO2 emissions. Because Lord knows the Polar Bears would like you to.
(Last year Changers closed $1.5 million in Series A financing from German government-backed fund BFB Frühphasenfonds Brandenburg, with participation from Heliocentris, a specialist in clean energy, alongside additional private investors).
The idea with CO2 Fit is that you enter the journey you are about to make, be it driving, cycling, using a train, or taking a plane. The app then monitors your location, speed etc and comes up with an estimate of how much CO2 you probably emitted and converts it into a “Recoin” (Renewable Energy coin) – a unit they have come up with to represent every kilogram of CO2 the user saves.
If you saved CO2, you are rewarded with Recoins – the Changers digital currency. If you emitted CO2, for example by driving your car, your CO2 emissions are also displayed. Afterwards, you can offset a negative CO2 balance by using the Recoins you earned by biking and using public transit. Users can also create Recoins themselves through the production of renewable energy with the intelligent Changers Solar Charger, launched a couple of years ago. The app also displays awards, badges & worldwide rankings to motivate you.
So how does it work?
You earn a Recoin for every 1 kilometre on a bike, 5 kilometres on a bus, and 20 kilometres on a train. Some 50 kg of CO compensation costs 50 Recoins or the equivalent of 0.89 Euros. Furthermore, 1 tonne of CO2 compensation costs 1,000 Recoins or 9.99 Euros. So to earn 1,000 Recoins you’d need to cycle 1,000 kilometres.
You can only buy the Gold Standard CO2 Certificates to offset your carbon emissions if you have earned Recoin, and you can only earn Recoin by changing your behaviour. This way you can participate in CO2 emissions trading far more easily than is currently possible.
Whenever you earn at least 50 Recoins by traveling by bike, bus or train, you can purchase a climate certificate from within the Changers app, which represents a saving of 25 kilograms of CO2. These “Gold Standard climate certificates” were launched in 2003 by several environmental organisations, including the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). These are issued by the London CO2 certificate exchange. This is like buying a virtual good in a game which actually has some impact in the world.
There is also a big knock-on effect at work here. If people buy CO2 certificates through the app, the price of the certificates would rise. This would put pressure on companies who – in carbon trading – already have to buy certificates to compensate for their emissions. It would effectively incentivise them to improve the efficiency of their technology and use more green energy.
Users in 61 countries and 736 cities are now using the app to gamify their CO2 emissions. Who saves the most, gets ahead.
Changers co-founder Daniela Schiffer says she wants the app to be fun and help people become aware of the impact of their behaviour.
“For those journeys, that can’t be avoided especially flying, we offer to compensate those comfortably within the app right after your journey. So you don’t have to go to some website and go through a whole purchase process but have the possibility to compensate with one click in your app,” says Schiffer.
Indeed, Changers is also looking at building a real crypto-currency based on the value of renewable energy. However, it might now be Bitcoin, because mining a Bitcoin is increasingly using up huge amounts of energy, thus counteracting the savings Changers wants to achieve. I’d be very interested to see what they come up with instead.
Schiffer says Changers is talking with several cities and companies to introduce the app this year and offer citizens and employees bonuses for their CO2 savings with greener mobility types.
Perhaps CO2 Fit isn’t going to be the final app to ‘game’ us into saving the planet, but it’s a good start.

434,Tesla Is Working On Robotic Snakes That Emerge From The Wall To Charge Your Car,https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/31/tesla-is-working-on-robotic-snakes-that-emerge-from-the-wall-to-charge-your-car/,2014/12/31,"Elon Musk is pretty much the best thing about Twitter, and today is no exception – the Tesla CEO tweeted that his electric car company is actually working on tech that would allow chargers to snake out of the wall and plug into your car automatically, eliminating the need to manually connect when you get your Model S back to your garage at night.


Btw, we are actually working on a charger that automatically moves out from the wall & connects like a solid metal snake. For realz.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 31, 2014



This would presumably somewhat resemble the kind of articulated robotic arms made famous by comic book villain Doctor Octopus, but less threatening and evil. The invention would appear to be driven by a desire to make the process of charging Tesla vehicles even more convenient, and also by extension more idiot-proof – you can’t forget to plug in your car when the plug is autonomous, after all.


This can be used with all existing Model S cars, not just futures ones.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 31, 2014



Backwards compatibility for said tech is a nice bonus, and yet another example of how Tesla goes out of its way to bring the benefits of its advances to existing, as well as new customers. Already, Tesla has begun rolling out battery swap tech that works with existing cars, and earlier this year it introduced a warranty extension that applied backwards to existing Model S cars already shipped.
 

"
435,Tesla To Begin Model S Battery Swap Pilot Program Next Week,https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/19/tesla-to-begin-model-s-battery-swap-pilot-program-next-week/,2014/12/19,"
Tesla showed off its upcoming battery swapping technology for the Model S electric vehicle last year, which would let users change out their battery rather than charging when on the road for a quick fill-up that’s speedier than actually refuelling a standard car’s gas tank. Starting next week, it’s launching the pilot program of that advancement in Harris Ranch, California, at a new facility directly across the street from the Supercharger in that area.
The pilot project is just that – an initial demonstration of how the system will work, designed to test the technical aspects of the procedure, and to see if it’s something Tesla drivers actually want. Unlike a recharge of their car’s existing battery pack, the swap won’t be free: instead it will cost “slightly less than a full tank of gasoline for a premium sedan,” according to Tesla’s official blog post on the matter. That could change in the future, but the swap involves labor and facility costs that charging does not.
Swaps also require setting an appointment in advance, and the process currently takes three minutes, although Tesla anticipates a time when it could take a minute or less. But continued development, and wider rollout, will once again depend on Model S owner interest. For some, the cost of tank of gas might be a primary reason for owning an electric vehicle, but something tells me Tesla’s more rarefied clientele could indeed get excited about trading that extra cash for a little more convenience, especially on long trips.

436,Eva Wants To Quantify Your Showering,https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/19/eva-indiegogo/,2014/12/19,"

Back at Disrupt SF this September a hardware hack called Shower With Friends won our hackathon. Its makers’ mission: to gamify water conservation by letting people compare how much water they had used during their shower with their friends.
Well, here’s another smart shower in the making: Eva is a device that attaches to your shower, between the water inlet pipe and shower head, and includes a proximity sensor, temperature sensor and a water flow valve so it can intelligently throttle back the water flow when the ideal water temperature is reached, or when the occupant has stepped away from the shower head. The basic idea being to conserve water by cutting the flow when it’s not really needed, such as while you wait for your shower to heat up, or step away to lather your tresses.
Now it’s worth stressing that this project is in the very early stages. Even for a crowdfunding project, which indeed it is. The U.S.-based team behind Eva has only been working on it for “about five months”, and the only photographs of their ‘working prototype’ which they were able to send me were the two pictures below of some plastic casing sliced in half. Judging by these prototypes they are probably stretching the definition of “working” at this point.

Currently the team is taking pre-orders by pitching for crowdfunding on the Indigogo website — and there all the imagery on show is slick-looking renders. Never a good look for a crowdfunding campaign that’s trying to sell you a product that doesn’t actually exist yet.
At the time of writing Eva has nearly raised the team’s targeted $50,000, with another 15 days left on the campaign. However it’s a flexible funding campaign, so whatever they raise they get to take home — which also means this is the sort of crowdfunding project that demands a higher degree of scepticism, given they get any money raised regardless of whether a critical mass of people view it as credible enough to back.
It’s true they are giving themselves a pretty long lead time to turn their plastic prototype into a working chunk of waterproof electronics — saying they “expect Evas to ship by next fall”. But as with all crowdfunding projects, there are zero guarantees they will stick to that guesstimated deadline. Or even ever ship a working product. Doing your own due diligence by asking questions and thinking critically before pledging any money is always advisable.
Caveats out of the way, the concept for Eva is at least somewhat interesting. The idea of making an appliance function more smartly, based on human occupancy of the space where it’s installed, is something we’ve seen widely applied to lighting — with motion sensing lights that switch off when no one is around, for example. Applying a similar principle to showers isn’t the worst idea in the world, albeit there are likely to be rather substantial waterproofing challenges for any electronics permanently housed in the wettest place in your house.
Eva will apparently be battery powered. And is being designed as a single mold of plastic with only one door, to minimize cracks and connection points where water might ingress. Its internal electronics will then be contained within a second “double dry area” for additional protection. And the team says it’s considering adding a water resistance treatment to the electronics. How well all these efforts stand up to high humidity and lashings of water regularly lashing down on the device is one very big question mark.
The device also faces some retro fitting issues, given it’s likely to be attached to existing showers. Getting it to sit flush with walls and play nice with your current pipes without causing all sorts of leaks is another obvious challenge. Potential pledgers can email photos of their current shower to the team — via photos@evasmartshower.com — to double check if it is compatible with Eva.
The ideal trajectory for this sort of smart appliance concept is to build it in to showers at the point of installation. We’re not there yet though, and so we have Eva promising to retro fit a few smarts to the pipes you have in the meanwhile. These are the transitionary foothills of the Internet of Things.
Other features the team says it’s going to build into Eva is a timer function so the shower can notify you via its companion app — using Bluetooth as the connectivity link — when your shower has extended over your custom time. And tracking of your showering habits to keep tabs on your overall water consumption. The app will also allow the user to customize water temperature or flow percentage at certain proximities to fit their preferences.
How much will Eva cost? It’s currently priced at $99 to Indiegogo backers, albeit you’d also need to factor in paying a plumber to fit it unless you’re confident in your own DIY skills.

437,Green Building Technology You’ll Never See But Can Experience Now,https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/14/ingenious-green-building-technology-youll-never-see-but-can-experience-now/,2014/12/14,"
Editor’s note: Parker White is vice president of business development in JLL’s technical services business. 
Picture an office that cleans up after itself, improves indoor air quality with nanotech-formulated paint, and responds to sunlight by magically adjusting window tint, all while fighting climate change. Then imagine entering your workspace to find your desk light on and the temperature just as you like it. These innovations are already at work in some modern buildings, in the shape of the networked ecosystem of “intelligent” building equipment and devices.
Beyond the “Wow!” factor and the large-scale benefits to our planet, green and smart building technologies are changing the way we live and work, and creating business opportunities for technology innovators, commercial building owners and tenants.
Buildings designed with sustainability-supporting materials, big-data-crunching automated systems and onsite clean energy are expected to represent 55 percent of all U.S. commercial and institutional construction by 2015, according to McGraw-Hill Construction’s 2013 Dodge Construction Green Outlook. Recent research from groups like CO2 Scorecard, demonstrate that these kinds of advancements in how people consume energy have contributed twice as much to the recent drop in U.S. GHG emissions as the reduced use of coal in favor of natural gas.
It’s no coincidence; sustained public interest in sustainability has triggered a surge of green building innovation. Spiraling water concerns and energy costs have sparked resource-efficient building operations among commercial property owners and occupiers. New regulations in many U.S. states and municipalities provide further motivation in the form of energy disclosure ordinances or tax incentives for sustainable construction and building operations.
Also important is the growing body of research showing that green buildings are good for employee health and well-being. Corporate tenants are willing to pay higher rents for the resulting workplace productivity gains, while employees and consumers alike prefer companies that are socially and environmentally responsible.
Here are a few of the building technologies that are changing the game of greening the planet –and transforming our culture in the process.
Nanotech Wonders: Paint That Invisibly Cleans Air
Does the paint in your office clear the air? Now it can. A Philippines-based company, Boysen, has created the world’s first air-cleaning paint. It’s based on nanoscale titanium dioxide, which is used to reduce harmful emissions in power plants and motor vehicles. It interacts with light to break down nitrous oxide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into harmless substances.
Nanotechnology is also behind smart electrochromic glass windows that can respond to environmental conditions. These windows can be integrated with building automation systems and programmed, along with other building equipment, to utilize natural sunshine and heat to offset the need for artificial lighting and artificial heating from HVAC.
Nanotechnology can even improve hygiene: Adding silver nanoparticles to paint can add lasting antimicrobial properties, an infection-prevention technique borrowed from the medical world. The biocidal effect of the released silver ions prevents the growth of mold, algae and bacteria.
Innovation in materials science and production technologies has made green building materials a thriving industry sector, with the global market projected to reach $529 billion by 2020, according to research firm Global Industry Analysts. For example, one category of new creative sustainably produced products is fire-retardant insulation produced from would-be waste materials such as shredded denim, plastic milk bottles, newspapers, agricultural straw, hemp and flax.
HAL 9000? More Like the Coolest Treehouse Ever
You arrive at your office building. The elevator is waiting for you as soon as you enter the lobby. It takes you straight to your floor without you pressing a button. You find your workspace ready for you, with lighting and temperature as you prefer, and your computer turned on for use. All this triggered when you parked your electric car in a wireless charging spot in the parking garage. Intelligent building automation systems are bringing this scenario to life today.
While it’s common to describe smart buildings as being driven by a brain, the future doesn’t really resemble HAL 9000—the sentient computer of Arthur C. Clarke’s2001: A Space Odyssey. Instead, the intelligence is becoming increasingly distributed in an ecosystem of connected devices and equipment engaged in machine-to-machine (M2M) communications. Like natural habitats such as trees or coral reefs, the parts of the ecosystem of a building are specialized to serve distinct functions with minimal intervention from the users.
Smart lighting, in particular, has become has become a fast-growing Internet of Things category according to global technology research firm ON World. The firm predicts that, by 2020, 100 million Internet-connected wireless light bulbs and lamps will be installed. As one of best sources from which save energy and improve workplace functionality, whole lighting systems can respond to the availability of natural light or presence of occupants spread across a building and automatically adjust in real time down to the level of a single bulb.
While traditional building equipment in older buildings still lacks embedded intelligence, companies like Pacific Controls can leverage existing building management systems to introduce operation optimization algorithms to otherwise dumb equipment. The Dubai-based global provider of end-to-end managed application services also uses cloud technology to connect the disparate building systems within a single building or across whole global portfolios. Combined with skilled facilities management staff, this level of integration opens new frontiers in how humans, machines and buildings can interact.

Energy Sourcing: Onsite Energy Technology Goes Net Zero

First the bad news: The United States generates more CO2 emissions than any country in the world except China; and commercial and residential properties generate approximately 40 percent of these emissions in the United States, according to the U.S. Green Building Council. Energy consumption is the driver of all this.
With nearly 30 percent of the $202 billion spent annually on U.S. commercial and industrial energy wasted, it’s not surprising that energy efficiency is a priority for commercial property owners. In fact, investing $279 billion in U.S. building efficiency could save more than $1 trillion in energy costs over 10 years, with every dollar invested producing three dollars of operational savings, according to report from The Rockefeller Foundation and Deutsche Bank Group.
Now the good news: An energy efficiency call to action is being heeded. U.S. GhG emissions have declined by 10 percent since 2005 primarily thanks to energy efficiency. To further accelerate these reductions, we can compound the efficiency gains on the demand side with improvements on the supply side.
The transformation of energy markets from coal to natural gas — enabled in part by fracking — is already showing how quickly a low carbon energy supply impacts national greenhouse gas emissions. Building-integrated energy generation has the potential to be even more disruptive.
Adoption of onsite renewable energy technologies is rapidly increasing. Tax incentives and technological advances have made wind, geothermal and solar power installation, smaller, more powerful and more affordable today than in the past. They can even be incorporated into traditional building materials, substantially reducing installation and material costs. Solar-power-generating paint, windows and road-surfacing materials are just a few of the applications for building component materials happening today.
Waste conversion technologies are also on the rise. New alternative options include biogas digesters that can turn methane from food waste into electricity. On a smaller scale, it is becoming common place for a building can to use refrigerator exhaust to heat water, heat exchangers to heat the building with the heat generated by office machines and computers, or drivers to convert the motion of vertical transportation systems into electricity.
For buildings that are expensive to retrofit with these new advanced technologies, building owners can partner with renewable energy companies that will install and maintain energy equipment at no cost in exchange for an energy-purchase agreement and the right to sell excess energy to the municipal grid. In fact, commercial property owners can use an energy matchmaking service that recommends the most cost-effective options, also at no cost to the property owner — a timely service, given the growing universe of highly technical solutions.
New renewable energy technologies, and falling prices for older technologies, have led to the emergence of “net-zero” and “Living Building” standards for environmentally friendly buildings. While exact definitions vary, the concept is that the total energy a building consumes annually is equal to or less than the amount of energy it creates. Most zero-energy buildings tap the public electrical grids for energy storage and backup power, but some are entirely independent. All rely on some form of renewable energy, combined with energy-efficient building design, systems and operation.
For all the advancements in building-integrated renewable energies, you might be wondering why you haven’t heard of it having a bigger impact already. The truth is that the building-integrated energy-generation sector hasn’t had its “fracking moment,” but that may be just around the corner.
The biggest barrier to more widespread adoption is efficient energy storage, and solutions are coming. Startups are emerging around the world with innovative products. Even automakers like BMW are getting involved. Solving this issue will do as much for building-integrated and distributed energy as the development of Nikola Telsa’s AC current generators did for centralized district power nearly a century ago.
The Incredible Shrinking Power Grid
Combined, the use of smart building technologies and renewable energy is displacing the traditional centralized power model with the technology-driven distributed energy concept. Today, a group of connected buildings can become its own energy self-sufficient microgrid, exchanging power among its members from diverse power sources. With the emergence of interactive smart grids in some communities, a smart building can even sell excess energy to the utility company.
The U.S. may even see the kind of market disruption that Germany is already experiencing, where renewable energy powers half of the country’s electricity-generating capacity and the system of centralized power generation is up-ended in favor of locally generated power.
These innovations in futuristic building technologies represent only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to greening the built environment. As demand for sustainably created and operated buildings continues to grow, we expect more exciting developments will move from the lab into actual practice.

438,Lessons From ESOS Energy Legislation In The UK,https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/10/esos-energy-legislation-in-the-uk-setting-the-operational-sustainability-bar-for-the-us/,2014/12/10,"
Editor’s note: Ashley Leonard is the president and CEO of Verismic Software, a global provider of IT management solutions delivered from the cloud.
The U.K. recently announced compliance guidelines for the government’s new Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme (ESOS), a mandatory energy assessment and energy-saving identification scheme in response to the requirement “for all Member States of the European Union to implement Article 8 of the Energy Efficiency Directive.”
The objective of ESOS is to reduce energy consumption, help address climate change, increase energy security and improve the competitiveness of U.K. businesses. The scheme, which came into force in July 2014, applies throughout the U.K. to enterprises of 250 or more employees and to enterprises under 250 employees, which have an annual turnover exceeding €50/$63.71 million and a balance sheet exceeding €43/$54.78 million.
The scheme calls for mandatory audits — required every four years and administered by the Environment Agency — intended to trim excessive energy use as a means to cut carbon and pave the way for increased business profitability, competitiveness and security, while mitigating organizational energy waste.
In short but not-so-simple terms, qualifying businesses are required to a) measure total energy consumption, accounting for 90 percent of usage across all buildings, transport and industrial activities; b) conduct energy audits to identify cost-effective, energy-efficient recommendations; c) ensure that the ESOS assessment has been conducted or reviewed by a board-level director and approved by a lead assessor; and d) report compliance to the Environment Agency by December 5, 2015.
While the ESOS audits are mandatory, certain caveats exist—as there is no obligation to implement these energy-saving measures internally identified in the audit, which is expected to cost somewhere in the neighborhood of £17,000/$27,200 on average in the first instance and £10,000/$16,000 for each subsequent audit.
Though the legislation’s notable feature appears spineless by failing to require businesses make any of these recommended changes to save energy, participants must demonstrate an authentic and rigorous attempt to examine opportunities for reducing energy use and have these findings reviewed at the board level. With this considerable investment of time and money, companies will likely be motivated to implement measures recommended in the audit which, according to the Department of Energy and Climate Change, could lead to on average a savings of £56,400/$90,240 per year, per business.
In order to encourage compliance as soon as possible, the government will impose penalties for various infractions, which could include fines of up to £50,000/$80,000 and/or an additional £500/$800 for each day an organization is out of compliance. Furthermore, the governing bodies also have the authority to publish (i.e. publicly shame) the names of non-compliant businesses.
The Challenge to Measure and the Burden of Proof
While companies may find motivation for implementing the recommended energy-saving measures of the audit solely for financial benefit, the ESOS directive is as much about enforcement as it is about the need for companies to understand power consumption. Uncovering pockets of energy waste requires appointing personnel familiar with the scheme; the only other option is to outsource, adding to the challenges for some companies to comply by deadline.
To comply with the new ESOS regulations, businesses will have to track their power usage to its source – the device actually employing the power.
When it comes to IT, the vast majority of businesses lack the technology to accurately track such energy consumption. Measuring the energy consumption of a Macbook Air compared to that of a Dell Desktop PC, for example, will prove to be difficult. While some organizations already have the Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) in place, allowing IT administrators to manage large groups of Windows-based computer systems, SCCM lacks the capability to provide the accuracy the ESOS audits will require.
Utilizing power-management solutions, with consistently updated content databases of makes and models currently in use, allows companies to reference the power consumption of each device, along with the actual power usage when on and off.
Though the U.K. has been relatively slow to implement PC power-management technology, mostly due to tax incentives, perhaps by example, U.S. rebates — which often cover the cost of implementation for this type of technology — will encourage something similar in the U.K. Of course, taking into consideration that the U.S. wastes an approximate $2.8 billion in PC energy every year, the U.K. may need to take a more effective approach to energy security.
Is Legislation the Answer and Will the U.S. Take Note?
There is little doubt that the ESOS regulations will be effective, considering the measures the government set in place to assuage potential resistance or roadblocks. Recognizing the additional administrative pressure placed on energy managers with ESOS — which will have many similarities to existing U.K. policies — the government is proposing that enterprises be allowed to utilize data from other schemes, such as the Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC) Energy Efficiency Scheme.
Of the 7,000-plus businesses required to participate, as many as 6,000 are already in the CRC scheme and have reported substantial savings from implementing measures as simple as installing motion-sensor lights in hallways and stairwells. The government estimates that the net benefit of the new ESOS policy will be around £1.9/$3.04 billion between 2015 and 2030, based on a conservative prediction that only 6 percent of potential energy-saving opportunities identified will be implemented. However, real benefits for businesses are likely to be two or three times greater than those estimates suggest.
Although energy efficiency in the U.S. has been a buzzword for years, when it comes down to it, the U.S. continues to rank lower than the U.K., Germany, Italy, Japan, France and Australia. According to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, even China and India have fared better on the list than the U.S. — as American energy regulations for power conservation have been particularly scarce in recent years.
In fact, Congress hasn’t passed a major measure since the 2007 legislation targeting ethanol; and in May 2014, Congress blocked yet another energy-efficiency bill that could positively impact the environment, create hundreds of thousands of jobs and save citizens billions of dollars a year by 2030.
Although the Obama administration and the now Republican-dominant Congress continue to be at odds over legislation that not only addresses energy efficiency but also regulates it, the U.S. has seen substantial progress at a state level toward more energy-efficient practices, particularly in the top-ranking states of Massachusetts and California.
Ideally, a partnership between U.S. government and industry is essential for an energy policy to have a significant impact on the future of businesses and the environment. However, this achievement won’t be cheap or easy. The state-by-state approach indicates great strides in U.S. energy efficiency and environmental stewardship, but at what cost to businesses?
As the U.S. continues to rank among the top three energy consumers in the world, mandatory legislation may be the only real solution — with the U.K.’s ESOS as the litmus test.

439,Off Grid Electric Raises $16M To Let Africans Pre-Pay For Solar Energy Just Like Phones,https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/08/the-electrical-revolution/,2014/12/08,"
How do you pay for solar energy if you don’t have a credit card or bank account? Thanks to Off Grid Electric, people in the developing world can pay as they go for installed solar power systems electricity the same way they top-up their phone minutes.
Now, thanks to $16 million in new funding from American solar finance and installation giant SolarCity, Off Grid Electric is pushing to grow from 25,000 customers to 100,000. “Pre-paid mobile is what really unlocked the mobile phone market in Africa, Off Grid CEO and co-founder Xavier Helgesen tells me. “Now it’s the beginning of the era of pre-paid solar.“
By replacing families’ inefficient, dangerous kerosene lamps with solar systems that can run modern lights, Off Grid is bringing the electrical revolution to countries still in the dark.
Charging Phones, Changing Lives
While most people think of light as the most essential use of technology, Off Grid found the number one reason their customers sign up is because they want to charge their phones.
Off Grid Electric CEO and co-founder Xavier Helgesen
Many residents of Tanzania where Off Grid operates don’t have outlets in their homes, and they can’t juice up an Android with kerosene. Like in other parts of the developing world, people have to hike to a nearby convenience store or business where someone will make them pay $0.25 to charge their phone, along with the inconvenience of having to leave it there.
Without proper energy grids in remote areas, the only option for some families in Tanzania is solar. But the average income there is only about $700 a year. Combined with the lack of banking or credit, installed solar systems that run as high as $1000 are too expensive to buy up front. Even then the customer is taking on a lot of risk while they slowly recoup the cost through cheaper energy.
That’s why Off Grid Electric took a cue from how people pay for mobile phone service in the region.
Pay As You Go Solar
“We’re a pioneer of micro-solar leasing” says Helgesen. That’s important, considering that since population grow has outpaced technological progress, there are more people without electricity now that when Thomas Edison lit the first lightbulb.
Customers pay a small $6 installation fee, and Off Grid puts a self-sustaining solar system on their house, complete with panels, lithium battery, super-efficient lights, and a meter. The panels collect energy and store it in the battery. But to use it, the customer sends Off Grid a mobile payment and gets a passcode they can enter on the meter to unlock their energy.

For about $5 to $10 a month, around equal or less than they pay for kerosene, Helgesen tells me Off Grid customers get “50X more light” plus the ability to charge their phone or power a television. They can’t run an energy-gobbling blender or toaster, but it all beats igniting jet fuel in your living room, which can lead to inhalation health problems or burns.
The idea is that over a 10-year period, Off Grid will make back the money it invests by letting families pay for a solar system over time. Compared to competitors, Helgesen says “Our price feels much more like a utility bill.” And since it uses a bring your own phone model rather than putting a phone inside the meter itself like some solar installers, Off Grid can be cheaper, doesn’t need deal with the telecoms, and works even if a customer’s home doesn’t get cell reception.
Enabling The Electrical Revolution
Helgesen tells me he met his co-founders and  became obsessed with the idea of Off Grid while studying at Oxford on a scholarship to solve big world problems. Previously, Helgesen started Better World Books, one of the biggest used book resellers that he says now does $70 million in revenue. But people can’t read without light, so Helgesen moved to Tanzania to solve a higher-order problem through solar.

The $16 million from previous investors SolarCity, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen’s Vulcan Capital, and UK-based Zouk Capital, Off Grid plans to expand its installation workforce while improving its hardware and software. The startup even runs its own vocational schools to teach locals how to be solar installation technicians.
The company is vertically integrated, doing everything but the manufacturing of the solar panels. It stands to profit by smoothing the signup, installation, metering, and payment process as it drives towards its next milestone of 100,000 customers.
There’s huge potential, as there are 8 million homes without electricity in Tanzania and another 8 million right across the border in Kenya. The model could scale to the entire developing world. Off Grid says it hopes its long-term payback strategy will help it out-compete others in the space like MobiSol and SolarNow where people pay more up front. The new equity funding could also instill confidence in big banks that Off Grid is tapping to finance the installations.
In a moment of reflection, Helgesen tells me he wishes more entrepreneurs would focus on serious, life-changing problems like energy, rather than “just a new app or something more trivial that was a problem in SF.” Helgesen declares “Think beyond the Bay Area bubble”, noting “I’m certainly way more passionate that I would be building an app.”
Helgesen didn’t grow up without electricity, but still traveled well outside his comfort zone to learn about a problem without enough potential solvers paying attention. His plan for Off Grid Electric? “Let’s not just build an incremental company, but light a billion people’s lives.”

440,Mainstreaming The Smart Grid,https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/29/mainstreaming-the-smart-grid/,2014/11/29,"
Editor’s note: Takafumi Arai is the digital marketing supervisor for Toshiba’s global smart community projects, which include a variety of renewable energy solutions that the company is implementing and testing in a dozen countries.
The October anniversary of Hurricane Sandy — which knocked out power in over 8,100,000 homes in 17 states and was the second-costliest hurricane in U.S. history — has served as an opportunity to reflect on how we view our power grid. The practice is important. Stephen Lacey provided some of the best analysis of what caused the storm and how utilities are adapting the grid. Many utilities across the country took note and have been actively researching and implementing solutions to prepare for the next big storm.
But out of that R&D, which factors deserve the most attention and resources? In my view, if utilities aren’t looking at how to implement smart meters, solar power generations systems and storage batteries, their system will be outdated in the next year. So what are some of the top utilities and companies doing in the U.S. to advance their grids with these solutions?
Smart Meters
Smart meters do more than just automatically turn up or down your heat, which is a simplistic explanation that is used pretty often. For example, Florida Power & Light (FPL) has spent over two decades working on a distribution system that extends from the smart meter to a performance and diagnostic center. Its system collects and leverages detailed information on previous outages – from momentary disruptions to trees falling on power lines – to understand and anticipate what is wrong in a current situation and respond automatically to imminent or current outages.
Smart meters are helping to manage water, too. Last year, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC) announced a $50 million project to install 177,000 new meters to automatically transmit hourly data back to the utility. Similar to the FPL example, the system can collect data on usage without anyone – the consumer or utility – having to manually check. Let’s say a water pipe breaks in your house while you’re on vacation. Because the utility sees that this produces unusual activity, it can turn off your water until you come back to deal with it.
You can find similar stories happening in utilities all over the country, and that’s because they understand the impact of smart meters not just in day-to-day energy usage, but also for aiding in disasters like Sandy. Let’s say every building and home in every state that was affected by Sandy had been equipped with a smart meter. Instead of taking weeks to manually search for outages in the electric or water lines (which is costly and can present a significant safety hazard), a smart meter could pinpoint the location of the fault so the utility could fix it quickly.
Solar Power Generation
You’ve likely seen homes equipped with solar-powered roofs or panels. As the White House reported in May 2014, every four minutes a new solar panel is being installed. These homes are becoming increasingly common, especially in areas with utilities that are offering incentives for installation, such as Consumers Energy in Michigan. (Michigan’s regulatory actions and financial incentives support this – specifically a 30 percent federal tax credit for any size project.)
These photovoltaic (PV) systems collect energy from the sun, and because they are connected directly to the grid, they can power the energy we use on a daily basis – from cooking to showering to simply heating the house. The concept of consumers being able to power their own energy use – as long as it’s tied back to the grid – is a compelling one.
But as these systems continue to be distributed for mainstream usage, U.S. utilities are also looking to Germany for guidance. Germany is a good case study, both for its successes and its oversights. Although it has come a long way since it started, German utilities vastly underestimated the popularity of rooftop solar when the initiative was new, so they didn’t prepare for the expensive upgrades the grid needed to support it.
For example, the electricity produced must be converted from DC (direct current) to 120/240 volt AC (alternating current) for consumers to use in the home. It doesn’t just do it itself – utilities need the right software and hardware in their infrastructure.
Storage Batteries
Another component of solar-power systems is storage batteries, which aren’t currently used much because they are still very expensive. However, these are guaranteed to take off in the very near future, and will be a critical component to a stable power grid.
Typically, when a utility loses power, solar generation systems are automatically shut down. But with effective storage batteries, the system could remain operational for days or weeks at a time. In fact, earlier this year Navigant Research released a market analysis and forecast on how effective batteries could have a significant impact on our grid.
When it comes to storage batteries, there are several factors a developer needs to consider. First, how safe is it? Keep in mind that a small nine-volt battery in a junk drawer next to some steel wool can burn down your house. The batteries we’re talking about are on a whole new level. For example, lithium-based batteries, which are being heavily explored as an option for energy solutions, can lead to gas leaks and ultimately fire if subjected to a host of thermal (it gets too cold) or electric (external or internal short circuits) abuse conditions.
Second, how quickly can it recharge and how long can it keep that charge? What if you live in an area like London, which is notorious for its overcast days? Or can it maintain during the winter months when we have longer stretches of dark than light?
Lastly, how efficient is it? Is it using more energy to store than it is to keep your solar-powered system running? At Toshiba, we believe these are the critical questions that should be asked when developing battery solutions.
Preparing For The Future
We can’t control hurricane season, and most of us will likely experience another hurricane similar to Sandy in the U.S. But with the technology and solutions available to us today, what we can prevent is the same level of destruction. The onus is not just on utilities and companies, but on all consumers who can ask their local utility what is being done to advance their systems.

441,Eric Schmidt’s Farm2050 Collective Will Back Agriculture Tech To Feed Earth’s Growing Population,https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/20/farm-2050/,2014/11/20,"
We’ll need to produce 70% more food by 2050 to sustain a world population expected to grow to 10 billion. Yet agriculture startups struggle to get the funding, manufacturing, and test facilities needed to build tech that could boost food production. To fix that disconnect, Google Chairman Eric Schmidt’s Innovation Endeavors and Flextronics Lab IX today launched Farm2050, a collective that will support AgTech startups with capital, design, manufacturing, and test farms to try out their inventions.
The Farm2050 partnership includes Google, DuPont, Agco, UTC’s Sensitech, and 3D Robotics. Flextronics’ Head of Lab IX Lior Susan tells me “It’s still not sexy to do agriculture. You don’t see IPOs and big acquisitions that pull Sand Hill into the game.” That’s why Farm2050 is necessary to foster an AgTech ecosystem.
Farm2050 is now inviting startups to pitch it ideas to address the global food challenge.

“You see a concentration where 90% of entrepreneurs are focused on 10% of the problems”, Innovation Endeavors’ managing director Dror Berman tells me. Agriculture has been really underserved. You can build a ton of technology companies here that really matter.”
Farming is already a huge market, with net farm income worldwide estimated at $120 billion a year. Yet the support structure hasn’t been there to accelerate technological advancements in agriculture as fast as in other industries. When there are breakthroughs, though, they truly help humanity.
Berman says “100 years ago we saw the Haber-Bosch process enable fertilizer development. 50 years ago we saw the refrigerated truck facilitate the long-distance transport of perishables. And today we’re seeing the emergence of robotics and machine learning applied to agricultural practices.”

Farm2050 is open to any ideas that boost food production. Specifically, though, it will be looking for startups working on how robotics and data science can advance the ways farmers seed, cultivate, and harvest all kinds of food.
The collective format that includes a range of companies, rather than just being a few investors, is designed to let corporations get involved with sparking AgTech innovation beyond just offering money. Berman tells me corporations frequently create incubators or fund startups, when really it’s their tech and expertise that could help most. Farm2050 will harness those resources, such as supply chain expertise, or sensor technologies, to help the companies it backs.
The mission-driven Farm2050 collective is a prime example of social venture capital, where returns are calculated not just in dollars returned, but good done. Susan concludes, “Our children and our grandchildren need to live here. If people who invest in startups can’t help, that kind of sucks.”
If you’ve watched Interstellar, you’ve seen a vivid portrayal of the desperate times a global food shortage could cause. If any entrepreneurs out there are on the fence about whether to get into AgTech, I hope that film and today’s announcement convince them there’s something more important to build than social games and photo apps.

442,The Department Of Energy Needs Your Help To Cut The Soft Costs Of Solar,https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/05/the-department-of-energy-needs-your-help-to-cut-the-soft-costs-of-solar/,2014/11/05,"
In recent years, incentives from the government to American solar startups combined with tough competition from Chinese manufacturers led to a steep drop in the price of commercial solar installations — roughly 50 percent since 2010, according to Victor Kane, manager of the Catalyst incubator program within the Department of Energy’s SunShot Initiative. The initiative aims to make the price of solar energy cost-competitive with electricity derived from other sources by the end of the decade.
As the portion of solar installation prices accounted for by so-called “soft costs” (like customer acquisition, which can come in at $2,000-4,000 for a $24,000 installation) increased, SunShot has shifted its focus to deal with removing these inefficiencies in the solar business.
This year, SunShot’s Catalyst incubator crowdsourced 130 problem statements involving these soft costs in solar energy by letting the public vote for the issues they deem most important. This drew attention to issues like the difficulty consumers have finding information about buying into solar or the price of inspecting large commercial installations.
In May, the platform opened a secondary crowdsourcing effort to bring in new ideas from outside the solar industry, giving entrepreneurs and engineers alike the chance to submit five-minute videos describing their high-level plans for addressing those big issues. The window for submitting ideas is open until November 7 at 11:59 p.m. EST, so if you’re interested you’ve still got a shot.
Once submissions close, the Catalyst team and external expert reviewers will look at each video and pick up to 20 teams to receive guidance from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and up to $25,000 in resources to build out early versions of their pitches. Most of those resources will come in the form of challenges submitted to TopCoder, where hobbyist programmers and professional developers will be able to submit implementations of whole applications. SunShot leadership hopes this will encourage more submissions by removing the intimidation of needing to know how to actually build out a solution.
In May 2015, those teams will reassemble for a demo day for investors. The top 5 teams will receive $100,000 to begin building out their ideas as full-on startups. SunShot Initiative director Minh Le tells TechCrunch that the Department of Energy’s goal is for these winners to come out of the program at a point where they’d be ready to join a more traditional Silicon Valley accelerator.

443,Ambi Climate Gives Any Air Conditioner Nest-Like Powers,https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/06/ambi-climate-kickstarter/,2014/10/06,"
Ambi Climate wants to democratize smart home climate control with a device that brings learning climate management to standalone window air conditioner units, central air systems, freestanding systems or the single room machines more common in Europe and Asia, so long as the existing system can work with an IR-based blaster or remote. It originally launched in July on Asia-specific crowdfunding site Crowdtivate, but now it’s looking to expand its audience in North America.
The hardware startup is kicking off its product launch on Kickstarter today, aiming to raise $25,000 to make its project a reality. The team already has a functional prototype built, with a near-final design that features a small hub device with micro USB power supply, IR transmitters for communicating with air conditioning units, and 802.11n Wi-Fi, plus BLE for iBeacon functionality.
The hub unit can receive commands from your devices via Wi-Fi and beam them through IR to your AC unit, but it’s not just a remote – it’s a learning system that’s meant to pick up on your arrival/leaving times, temperature preferences throughout the day, sunlight, internal and external temperature, movement and more to automate your home climate control. The startup has built its own proprietary software algorithms to make this possible, in addition to creating the sensor-laden Ambi Climate device.
It tries to maximize the energy efficiency of your system while keeping things comfortable, and the founders claim that it can cut your energy bill by up to a third when used constantly. There aren’t any tools for installation as with other options like Nest, and it works even with apartment window air conditioners, so long as they’re new. The IR method might actually not be compatible with a lot of central air systems that Nest would work best for, so Ambi Climate might be well-positioned to pick up the parts of the market not covered by the Google-owned firm.
Early backers can also pick one up for just $49 per unit, which is $100 less than the company expects to charge when they ship in June 2015. If you can’t wait, there’s a beta edition available for delivery by the end of November of this year, which is rare for a crowdfunded project.
Ambi Climate is the product of Ambi Labs, a startup founded out of Hong Kong hackerspace Dim Sum Labs. CEO and co-founder Julian Lee has a long history of executive roles in the startup space and at Accenture. Chief Software Architect Timothy Chang was a developer at RIM as a student before moving on to become a software developer at MD provider The Institution. And Chief Hardware Engineer Paul Sykes has a history of designing hardware and software for the pharmaceutical industry and radio and TV broadcast.

444,Tesla Wants To Sell You A Used Model S,https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/06/tesla-wants-to-sell-you-a-used-model-s/,2014/10/06,"
The only thing better than a new Tesla is a cheap Tesla, and the company reportedly is set to unveil a program to address the sticker shock and it isn’t a cheaper car. It’s used cars.
Certified pre-owned vehicles are big business for luxury automakers. Speaking to automotive News, Tesla vice president of communications, Simon Sproule, confirmed that the electric car maker is developing a program to resell Tesla vehicles.
Tesla would sell used Model S sedans under the “certified” moniker hoping to lure buyers who want quality at a lower price. BMW and Mercedes-Benz have done this for years, but Tesla’s entrance into this market would be a boon for consumers and the car company itself.
Unlike BMW or Mercedes, Tesla owns its dealerships, allowing it to retain much more of the used car’s profit than a traditional auto maker.
Elon Musk previously guaranteed the resale value of the Model S. Announced in April 2013, those who financed a Model S are allowed to return the vehicle after three years for 43 to 50 percent of its sticker price — just in time to buy a new Tesla vehicle.
Tesla is set to unveil an updated Model S and another electric vehicle later this week. The Model X SUV will hit the market early next year and an inexpensive Tesla (somewhere around $35k) should be available late next year. If Tesla’s trade-in program is successful, it needs to be able to offer current Tesla owners something other than another Model S.
This trade-in program would also serve consumers who want to forgo gas and buy a Tesla but cannot afford the high price of a new Model S. supposedly, Tesla dealerships would thoroughly inspect the returned Model S before reselling it, hoping to alleviate some anxiety with buying a used electric car.

445,Apple CEO Tim Cook Says Tech Companies Should Accept No Compromises On Climate Change Issues,https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/22/apple-ceo-tim-cook-on-climate-change/,2014/09/22,"
Apple CEO Tim Cook sat down with UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres today at Climate Week NYC to discuss Apple’s concerns when it comes to climate change, and what the company is doing to address the situation. Cook summed up his company’s efforts by saying that Apple needs to be “one of the pebbles in the pond that creates the ripple,” refer to inspiring a broader effort to improve environmental practice among tech industry leaders.
“You look at what are the root causes, and you’re not accepting that there’s a trade-off between the economy and the environment,” he said in the interview. “If you innovate and you set the bar high, you will find a way to do both. and that you must do both, because the long-term consequences of not addressing the environment are huge.”
Cook said that this attitude of not compromising is something that Apple has already had plenty of practice with when it comes to their product design and development process, which is why it makes sense to apply it here, too.
“That’s the reason that everyone at Apple […] is not accepting that you have to pick this or this,” If we took that kind of approach to our product, we would never make a great compromise. the truth is that you can’t compromise.”
As an example of Apple’s environmental policy leadership, he cited the new headquarters currently under construction in Cupertino, which Cook said he expects to be one of the greenest buildings on the planet. He also pointed to its data centers, which use renewable energy for power, and to their efforts all the way down the supply chain in keeping their partners in line. Cook said that this requires real, hands-on work.
It’s dirty and it’s detailed work,” he said of their supply chain audits and partner responsibility programs. “It’s rolling your sleeves up. it’s not esoteric and theory, it’s real work and real projects.”
Cook’s general advice for how to improve the state of the tech industry and its overall contribution to climate change situation improvements are best summed up as a call for greater transparency. Without calling anyone out directly, Cook still managed to challenge Apple’s competitors to do more in terms of making their environmental effects part of the public record.
“I think companies have to communicate, to consumers, about what they’re selling, and they have to do it in a way that communicates the whole of their footprint, and not just the one part they’re looking good on, but all of it,” he said. “And I think that if you do, I’m an optimist, I think that if you do that consumers are smart and the vast majority of the world wants to do the right thing, so I think [transparency] will drive desired consumer behavior. if you have enough companies that begin to do that, I think consumers will vote with their dollars.”
Apple’s own environmental efforts have earned it a significant amount of praise from Greenpeace lately, where it currently ranks as a top performer among major tech companies, especially regarding use of renewable energy.

446,Google’s Skybox Satellites Shoot GIFs Of Burning Man Being Built,https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/17/burning-man-satellite-photos/,2014/09/17,"
Google bought Skybox Imaging for $500 million, and the micro-satellite company’s most recent mission was…to take photos of Burning Man. Skybox repeatedly flew its satellites over Burning Man to create GIFs of how the 70,000 person make-shift hippie city was assembled and then deconstructed over three weeks. For example, above you’ll see the whole city rise and fall, and below you can see the massive “Man” effigy being erected through August, and then the ashy debris on September 1st after it was burnt.

Jokes aside, the GIFs actually prove Skybox’s big advantage over other satellite companies. Since its micro-satellites are much smaller and therefore cheaper, so it can more of them up in space than companies building big, expensive, traditional satellites that power the infrequent updates to products like Google Maps. One of those might have missed the ephemeral Burning Man event entirely.
But since Skybox had both its SkySat-1 and SkySat-2 photographing the festival of expression, self-reliance, and gifting, it could get images every few days that really reveal how the whole city appears and disappears in under a month thanks to hardworking burners (and tech elites too) getting their hands dirty. Here’s how Burning Man Center Camp emerged from and returned to the dust.

Skybox’s site has a more GIFs and an interactive tools that lets you see what Burning Man looked like on a given day. At first glance it might seem frivolous or a bit worrisome in terms of its surveillance potential. But when applied to farming, disaster relief, or monitoring ecological issues, Skybox could use photos from space to make life better here on earth.

447,"HowGood, Now With $2M In Funding, Releases Apps For More Sustainable Grocery Shopping",https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/17/howgood-now-with-2m-in-funding-releases-apps-for-more-sustainable-grocery-shopping/,2014/09/17,"
New mobile applications from HowGood want to help shoppers become better informed about which food is best to eat – and not just which food is healthiest, as the name suggests, but whether the animals were treated humanely, if the workers were paid fair wages, if the food was produced locally or sustainably, and much more. In addition, the company is announcing that in order to accelerate growth, it has taken in $2 million in outside funding from FirstMark Capital, Highline Ventures, Great Oaks Venture Capital, Serious Change LP, Jake Lodwick and Joanne Wilson.
Founded back in 2007, HowGood is an established research organization based in New York, which has developed its own rating system to identify the leaders in the food industry. It licenses that data to smaller grocers in 21 states across the U.S., as well as other food and tech companies.
HowGood determines the overall “goodness” of foods and awards ratings to the best products in an effort to aid consumers who are interested in making smarter, more sustainable shopping choices.
That system today includes over 60 benchmark indicators of a company’s behavior, ranging from the ingredients to the manufacturing process to the way workers are treated. HowGood looks at nearly every factor that goes into a food’s production, even things most consumers don’t think about when dropping items into their shopping cart – like carbon emissions or concerns around hazardous waste.

HowGood’s mobile applications arrive at a time when a growing number of people are becoming interested in making better food decisions, and not only for health reasons. Of course, health is still popular reason for changing one’s shopping behavior, with things like the paleo, vegetarian/vegan, gluten-free and raw food diet trends as a contributing factor, not to mention research that shows how diet changes can impact a number of health issues, or even lower cancer risk, in some cases.
But a number of shoppers, and especially younger consumers, are increasingly aware of the benefit of buying sustainable products from socially responsible companies, and are sometimes even willing to pay a premium for these goods.
That groundswell movement is especially impacting the organic food market, which is now expected to grow 14% from 2013 to 2018, with 81% of American families now saying they buy organic sometimes. Meanwhile domestic organic food production is up 240% between 2002 and 2011. Whole Foods has benefited from this change, though it’s now having to fight off rivals who have increased their own natural-goods selections.

Shopping organic is just one sliver to what it means to shop sustainably, however. Several tech companies today are offering online “green” shopping destinations, like Amazon-owned VineMarket.com, sustainable grocery shop ePantry, or the Jessica Alba-backed eco-friendly marketplace The Honest Company, for example.
But when you’re out shopping in the real world, it can be difficult to make the best decisions. That’s what HowGood aims to change with its mobile apps.
The apps, now available on iOS and Android, let you search and navigate through product listings, or scan the barcodes on the packaging to view the ratings. The scoring system is also kept simple, with one, two or three globes indicating good, better and great, respectively. That helps you make a quicker decision without having to get bogged down in deciphering the data.
At launch, the company has rated over 100,000 products, and found that only 6% of the industry earned the highest rating, which proves there are challenges ahead for those who shop by stricter guidelines. But already, the information HowGood provides is having an impact, the company says – it has actually seen a 27% increase in sales of products that have the highest rating in stores that use the ratings to promote products on the shelf.
HowGood declined to provide specifics around its own sales data and revenue, but notes that its 16-person team is now growing thanks to the new financing, and it’s hoping to expand its in-store ratings system (which helps grocers promote sustainable products to boost their own bottom lines) to larger grocery stores going forward.

448,"Stack’s Smart Sensor-Packed Light Bulbs Run Autonomously, No App Interactions Required",https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/09/stacks-smart-sensor-packed-light-bulbs-run-autonomously-no-app-interactions-required/,2014/09/09,"
Over the past few years a swath of self-styled ‘smart lights’ have pushed into the market. The likes of Philips Hue and Kickstarter fueled LIFX. Aka connected lightbulbs that can be controlled via an app. But this is just the first wave of smart lighting — and it’s really not-so-smart, argues new lighting focused startup Stack, launching today on stage here at TechCrunch Disrupt SF.
Stack’s view is that truly smart connected objects should be autonomous, rather than require their owner to continuously tend to their needs via an app. Because, well, as I for one have noted before, needing to use an app for every bulb in your home is just tedious. So Stack’s ‘lightbulb moment’, if you will, is to create smart lights with built-in ambient light, motion and occupancy sensors — enabling them to respond dynamically to their environment without the need for constant app-based interaction.
The bulbs are packed with sensors, Bluetooth, Zigbee and iBeacon hardware, and microcontrollers allowing them to react autonomously once installed. During the initial set up process the owner is asked to specify (yes, via an app) whether the bulbs are installed in a commercial location or a home. And once they choose one of those two options they’re good to go, with the system using a series of commercial or residential pre-sets to dial light up or down, based on ambient light conditions, time of day and occupancy of the room.

“If you say ‘home’ it automatically defaults all the bulbs with a pre-set,” explains Stack CEO Neil Joseph, who left his day job at Tesla to set up the company. (Another co-founder used to work in electrical engineering at NASA and is now helping Stack nail down its light sensing algorithms.) “In the morning it’ll be a cooler, blue light, and then as the day goes on the lights will automatically adjust their color temperature. All the way to a warmer color by the evening,” he adds.
Initially the residential market will be the startup’s target, although Stack has big plans for business use — hence the iBeacon integration and a planned analytics offering so commercial users will be able to use the bulbs to determine things like footfall within a store.
Using connected light bulbs as iBeacons offers a high-resolution way to surveil a space, argues Joseph. “It’s the same functionality as any other iBeacon except it’s a higher resolution… There are more bulbs in any space than any other electronic device because of how numerous they are.”
“The two biggest applications we see is in the retail sector to measure foot traffic and motion throughout a store. As well as with the iBeacon part of it being able to have that interactivity with their customers. The big thing here is because they already have the lights they don’t have to get a whole separate system installed to have iBeacons deployed,” he adds.
On the residential side, a key area of focus for Stack’s marketing will be on how its product can help improve users’ sleep patterns. That’s because Stack bulbs are color temperature sensitive to the time of day, meaning the shade and intensity of the light will be in tune with outdoor light levels and therefore with the human circadian rhythm.
Hence Stack’s bulbs using a bluer color temperature in the mornings, and becoming warmer, softer and dimmer in the evenings — in an effort to make the indoor environment mimic the natural outdoor light cycle of sunrise, daylight, dusk and darkness. Despite this shifting color temperature, all Stack’s light shades are white. No lurid lighting colors here.
“What’s been interesting through this discovery process is learning how light really impacts people’s health. There’s been a lot of technology… that tries to measure how you sleep. There are all the wearable devices that try to measure that. And the thing is… what do you do about that once you know that you aren’t sleeping well? For your circadian rhythm, one of the biggest influencers on that is light,” notes Joseph.
“If you’re able to tune the lights — so let’s say, saying what time you’d ideally like to go to bed and wake up, and have the right tone of light and amount, it will definitely help readjust your body and really maximize your energy focus and overall health. So that’s one of the big things that we’re doing that will be in our app. That’s actually the biggest thing that we see people utilizing our app for; is just simply saying I want to try to go to bed by 11.30pm and I want to wake up at 7am. So as you get closer to the evening the lights automatically start dimming down and they’re a warmer hue and your body will naturally respond to that, and start to relax.”

The potential for energy savings using Stack is another key area of focus. Joseph tells TechCrunch the bulbs yield energy savings of between 60 and 80 per cent compared to LED bulbs across residential and commercial deployments. This is owing to their ambient light-sensing smart dimming, so there’s never any redundant light energy being expended. Rather they shine as brightly as conditions require. Also helping conserve energy is their ability to switch off entirely when rooms are unoccupied, so again bulbs aren’t left burning unnecessarily.
It’s worth noting that some commercial environments already have sensor-powered lighting control systems installed that respond to — for instance — room occupancy, to switch lights off at night when the last employees have clocked off and gone home. But Joseph says Stack offer a much cheaper and easier way to install a dynamic lighting system than one of these high cost lighting control systems. No lighting engineers or additional IT installations are required to run Stack.
Per bulb Stack costs $60, although you also need a Zigbee hub. A hub plus a two-bulb pack will cost $150 — with each bulb offering a lifespan of around 50,000 hours. Joseph says that cost stacks up well against the upwards of $100,000 a business might need to shell out to install a full sensor-based lighting control system. And of course Stack allows for bulbs to be installed gradually, as budget allows.
Today the first Stack bulb is up for pre-order — with an estimated delivery date of Q1 next year. The first bulb format is a recessed can light. It’s calling this bulb Alba. Additional bulbs formats will follow in the first and second half of 2015, according to Joseph. The startup is also intending to make a connected fixture for the smallest MR16 bulbs, which might have trouble fitting all its sensor tech inside the bulb itself. “Over the course of the next year we’re going to have all of the major formats of lights and fixtures,” he adds.
Stack’s bulbs will support integration with Google’s Nest and Apple’s HomeKit (IFTTT support is planned too). There will also be a Stack API to extend usage via third party apps, should users want more functionality.
The Stack app itself does also support more granular control if the user is so inclined — allowing the setting up of different zones within a house, for instance, although the core philosophy here is to avoid the necessity for too much micro control. Bulbs can be drags and dropped into zones within the app. Zones can also be provisioned by location — so a user could, for instance, stand in their bedroom and tell the app to zone all the nearby bulbs as the ‘master bedroom’.
Beyond the individual connected bulbs, launching today, the grand vision is for Stack to form the backbone (or indeed the stack) for many more connected indoor devices.
“The way we see it is because we have these sensors in the bulb — and if you think about it, generally lights are the most common electronic devices in a building, whether it’s residential or commercial, we view it as we become the backbone of a responsive sensor network throughout the house,” adds Joseph. “With HomeKit and Works With Nest, with those APIs and some APIs of our own, we’re going to be able to help tie together all of those other products.”



Judges Q&A
Q: Maybe you could walk through the experience of how I use the product…A: Imagine just setting the time of when you want to wake up and go to bed. It comes on with a bluer hue of light in the mornig… then by the evening a warmer or yellow hue of light helps you to go to bed
Q: What is the major advance here?A: The major advance that we’ve done is the embedded sensors and being able to tie all that together
Q: I need to be able to control itA: It can learn, it turns itself on if there’s a commotion
Q: So I can just buy this on Amazon today and screw this into my current light fixture and it’ll workA: You can pre-order today and we’ll begin shipping in Q1
Q: The context of how I want my life set up is very contextual… how does it know that context and how does it work in an existing environment where I have dimmers and switches?A: Our bulbs will be able to work with all the common dimmers… We have pre-loaded pre-sets. And common pre-sets – like a dinner party mode that’s softer… In the app you can drag and drop. You can adjust [individual bulbs] in the app if you want
Q: Is commercial or residential the bigger opportunity here?A: We’re going after residential first because we need more formats of lights
Q: Marketing question. It’s always a challenge to tell people what a reinvented thing is. What’s your elevator pitch?A: Alba is the world’s first responsive lightbulb. You don’t have to touch an app, it will automatically respond to the environment
Q: My life is never linear, I want to override the pre-sets what do I do?A: That’s why we have the app. You go down to the individual bulbs and adjust them
Q: How many of the hubs do you need for a normal house?A: You only need one per house. We use Zigbee… it’s a mesh network. One unit can go all the way
Q: What is the price point compared with Philips Hue or some of these other smart lights?A: We’re pricing it at $60 just like the Philips Hue. Same price but much more functionality
Q: What’s the life like?A: Generally the newer LEDs will be 50,000 hours… So a home setting you’re talking 30+ years. In a commercial setting on for 12 hours a day over 11 years
Q: The challenge of getting LEDs to work correctly with dimmers seems to be an unresolved issue. How do you play nice?A: There are many types of dimmers and a common core set that everyone tries to work with but ultimately there we say get rid of the switch long term. That’s our dream for a truly responsive home
Q: Tell me about the founders – what led to this idea?A: This started when I was at Tesla… I was sitting in the office building and I thought why are these lights on at full power? Why can’t they dim like our phones or TVs — so I set about creating the technology and building an awesome team.

449,Valor Water Analytics Helps Water Utilities Stay Afloat As Customers Conserve,https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/08/valor-water-analytics-helps-water-utilities-stay-afloat-as-customers-conserve/,2014/09/08,"
As more Americans become aware of the need to conserve water for environmental reasons, or due to drought-related water use restrictions, the water utilities have found themselves struggling to stay financially sound as they begin to sell less water to their customers. Valor Water Analytics is a company moving into this largely ignored sector in order to provide utilities with software that can help them better understand how customers’ changing water usage patterns will affect their bottom lines, and what they can do about it beyond just rushing to raise rates.
The company was founded by Christine Boyle, who holds a doctorate in water resource planning from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The idea for the software program actually came out of a grad school project, she says, where she had developed a set of analytical tools to help utilities who were struggling financially as customers conserved during a drought.
Though she first began working on the tools back in 2007, it took some time for her to license the technology from her university. But now Valor has a worldwide, exclusive, transferable license for the technology, and the software is currently being used by four utilities in N.C., including those in Cary, Fayetteville, Greensboro, and Chapel Hill area. These utility customers are pilot testing the program, but they’re not the first to have done so.
Valor is working with the Urban Water Consortium, explains Boyle, which directs which utilities will trial the program at what time. Over the years, Valor has worked with 15 utilities in total, she notes.
Officially incorporated as of last November, Boyle is now preparing to take Valor Water Analytics from being more of a research effort into a software-as-a-service business.
Using an online portal now being re-coded with more modern programming languages, utilities can log in and view how water use changes impact revenue. A variety of product lines help them address concerns around conservation and drought, allowing the businesses to increase charges more appropriately.
For example, it may target rate hikes at those who are wasting water, rather than an across-the-board rate hike which effectively punishes those who are conserving water appropriately.

Utilities can also structure pricing with things like “water budgets” which are like guidelines for customers’ water usage. If you exceed your water budget, you might pay more, for instance.
Boyle says that the software isn’t just about putting this business intelligence data into an online dashboard, but also guiding the utilities to make better financial decisions. “We run the analytics but we also deliver advising and insight…we layer it with suggestions,” she explains. “Utilities were so hungry for this information.”
Prior to her company’s software, most utilities didn’t have programs that could do this sort of number-crunching, says Boyle. Instead, they’d sometimes have data analysts creating fancy Excel spreadsheets, or would bring in outside consultants every few years. “It sounds weird that they haven’t been looking at this stuff…but they’re really not. That’s why this is exciting for us,” she says.
Valor Water Analytics, now based in the Bay Area, has just landed its first California utility customer, and is working to sell to others across the state and the U.S.
The company generates revenue at a rate of about 38 cents per customer during year one (which tends to involve the integration work with backend systems), and then at 18 cents per customer afterwards.
At Disrupt, Valor launched its “Drought Conversation Toolkit” for utilities, which is a product that’s specifically designed to help a utility manager measure the revenue impacts of drought-related conservation. Also at Disrupt, Valor announced a partnership with ESRI and a deal with Sonoma County’s (CA) water utility.
The startup, which has a small amount of angel funding, is looking to raise an additional round of $500,000 in order to get to scale faster.

Judges’ Q&A
Judges this round included: Cyan Banister, Partner, Banister Capital; Cyril Ebersweiler, Founder, HAXLR8R accelerator; Ryan Sweeney, Partner, Accel Partners; David Tisch, Managing Partner, BoxGroup; Q&A paraphrased for brevity.
CB: How long is the sales cycle?
A: We went to market in June, and the first sale quick. We have 10-15 in the pipeline, we don’t know how long it will take close them. I know it’s government, so it could be slow. I’m going to say 6 months as a guesstimate.
CE: Market size? How many utilities and what kind you charge them?
Is it a problem getting all their data into your software?
A: U.S. has over 50K water utilities. But we’re going after middle and large sized utilities.
Extracting data – we work closely with the utilities I.T. dept, and extract data from billing system. So far, it has worked. To scale, we have some other choices to make, in terms of working with third parties.
CE: Is there a reason for a utility to not work with you?
A: [Some] don’t know why they need to change from the way they’ve done things for year. We need to push them to adopt new solutions because yesterday’s solutions aren’t working today. We’re working with a ‘coalition of the willing’ first, then will fight the harder battles after we have a reputation established.
DT: What benefit have utilities extracted?
A: We help find hidden revenue. We are able to locate cost and efficiencies. Utilities are concerned with affordability and community issues, and we help with that, too.

450,Tesla Model S Software Update Brings iPhone Unlocking And Ignition Start,https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/21/tesla-model-s-software-update-brings-iphone-unlocking-and-ignition-start/,2014/08/21,"
Tesla owners have been looking forward to OS 6.0, a software update for their vehicles, for a while now, but it’s finally rolling out to vehicle owners, reports Electrek. The system adds a bunch of new features for Model S vehicles, including a new Calendar app for in-car use, and big improvements to the Maps/Navigation software. What’s amazing (and surprising) for iPhone users is that they can now unlock and start their car from their devices if they forget their physical key fob at home.
The update is yet another indication of Tesla’s commitment not only to future customers, but also to existing vehicle owners. Musk announced just last week that the Model S would get a warranty extension for its drive train of infinite miles for up to eight years. Bringing major changes to the in-car software system post-purchase is another deviation for the standard operating procedure for vehicle owners, and letting them use their smartphones as remote access and remote starters is ordinarily an expensive aftermarket upgrade.
Basically Tesla needs to make these cars affordable for ink-stained hacks like myself stat. The new $35,000 Tesla Model 3 is now official, but its limited range makes it less appealing, and we have to wait until 2017 for it to go on sale. Until then, I guess I’ll just have to stick with envy.

451,"Move Over, Uber, SF Residents Can “Yo” A Smart Car To Take Them Anywhere They Want Tomorrow",https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/20/move-over-uber-sf-residents-can-yo-a-smart-car-to-take-them-anywhere-they-want-tomorrow/,2014/08/20,"
A very gimmicky Mercedes-Benz campaign hopes to tap into the SF tech millennial market tomorrow by offering free rides in its smart electric vehicles to anyone who sends them a “Yo.”
Starting at noon on August 21, smart will place pop-up signs at two outdoor locations in San Francisco – one in the Mission and one in SoMa. Anyone who reads the sign and then sends out a “Yo” to “smartUSA” will get picked up on the spot and taken to wherever they tell the driver to go. “The main priority is to get people to drive the vehicle, and tapping into that Yo audience is a great way to do that,” says Mercedes-Benz spokesman Eric Angeloro. “We’re giving ‘Electricurious’ San Franciscans the world’s first-ever Yo-powered test ride.”
The campaign is niche for sure. As Angeloro puts it, “Our cars are simple and so is Yo” —  though Yo is sorta not so simple anymore. It has links, hashtags and a bunch of other built-in features that now give users a more robust experience within the app. One might even say it’s a bit more complicated than Secret now.
The idea for this event is reminiscent of the sort of stuff Chevy does at SXSW every year. The “Catch a Chevy” campaign has been picking up attendees and motoring them through downtown Austin during the Interactive portion every year for the last four years. Both these types of campaigns attempt to grab the attention of a tech-savvy, pro-enviro audience.
Angeloro says this one is perfect for the San Francisco crowd because of parking. If you’ve ever tried to park in our fair city, you know we have a serious dearth of spots. Oh sure, once in a while you get tricked into thinking your car might just fit in an open spot, only to realize it’s a good four inches too small. The smart cars are perfect for this. And in addition to being easier to park, they don’t require gas while you putter around town.
These pint-sized coupes were subject to tipping crimes in the city earlier this summer. Sort of SF’s version of cow-tipping. This trend has been going on nationwide since smart cars hit in 2011, according to NBC. There were six reported SF incidents in all.
With a 17.6kWh battery that provides a range of 68 miles, the compact, plug-in smart car is able to take commuters anywhere within SF city limits. Angeloro says there will be 8 vehicles out and about tomorrow, three of which will be electric and five gas-powered just in case. We’ll see if the campaign makes any millennials more “Electricurious” though.

452,New At Y Combinator: Startups Solving Huge Problems!,https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/19/new-at-y-combinator-startups-solving-huge-problems/,2014/08/19,"
During today’s Y Combinator Demo Day, there was a notable block among the startups presenting that didn’t give off the vibe we’re used to seeing at this kind of event in Silicon Valley: companies that are addressing real issues with big, bold solutions. We’re not talking about minor problems we all have — like getting burritos delivered quickly — but issues that could have an enormous impact on our world as a whole.
Here are the most obvious examples:

There were two companies building nuclear reactors that could fundamentally change the way we provide power both at home and in developing nations.
The Immunity Project is looking to make a vaccine that could eliminate HIV and AIDS.

Glowing Plant and Gingko Bioworks want to change manufacturing and pharmaceuticals as we know them by creating genetically-modified plants that can produce materials and products like fuel and milk and bacteria that actively treat illnesses.

Bayes Impact take the insight that data science has given to private sector projects and shares it with non-profit causes.

Bikanta is making nanodiamonds that make it easier to spot cancer.

One Codex’s search engine for genomic data will let researchers tracking pathogens a faster and more reliable method for identifying potentially deadly viruses and bacteria.

UBiome is privatizing research into the microbes that live in our bodies and have unknown effects in our moods and health.

Rigetti Computing is building a quantum computer for commercial applications.

When I first spoke with Y Combinator president Sam Altman about Helion, the first nuclear fusion startup to receive funding and support from the accelerator, he told me it was no happy accident YC was investing in a potential game-changer in the energy space — he had been looking into energy startups as a personal passion for a year and a half.
As it turns out, that’s also true for the other ambitious companies that presented today. During a brief chat during our lunch break, Altman confirmed that the accelerator has a list of big issues that it would like to fund solutions to, though he jokes that it’s in “an encrypted DMG file that no one outside of Y Combinator can see.” Altman says other YC partners’ passions are reflected in the accelerator’s lineup of batch companies, as well.
He also noted there are a few other big issues that aren’t as flashy as nuclear fusion and quantum computing. Those include the trend away from stable, long-term employment to shorter tenures, freelancing, and independent contracting.
While it’s not a problem that demands advances in plasma containment or quantum physics, long-term shifts in the workforce will change the way we think about the labor market. Y Combinator-backed startups like Zen99, Fixed, and Checkr, while appearing simple at first glance, will make that transition smoother.
That said, not much has changed, by Altman’s account, at YC. As he told my colleague Kim-Mai in an interview earlier today, “YC has never been in the software business. YC is in the business of funding huge companies.”
A company building a nuclear reactor might not look much like Airbnb, but any disruptive startup needs the right culture, plan, and a whole lot of luck to succeed. In that way the two aren’t that dissimilar, and Y Combinator wants to be there to help them both.

453,Philips Hue Lux Review: Smart Lighting For Less,https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/19/philips-hue-lux-review/,2014/08/19,"
If you’ve been eyeing the Philips Hue connected lighting series with keen interest but are also unwilling to spend the big bucks the current series demands, now’s your chance to get on board: Philips has kicked off pre-orders for the Hue Lux line of bulbs, including individual units and a starter kit including two bulbs and a base. The Lux trades programmable colors for a cheaper price tag, but most consumers won’t miss the extra features.
The Philips Hue Lux retails for $29.99 per bulb, which is half the price of the standard Philips Hue and Hue Downlights and Spotlights. The Starter Kit retails for $99.99 U.S., which is $100 cheaper than the starter kit for the standard color-changing bulbs, albeit with one fewer bulb included in the kit. The trade-off is that they only offer up a soft white light, which isn’t changeable, but all other Hue features are included, including times, geofencing, scene compatibility with other Hue apps and remote brightness control.
The Lux is a 750 lumen bulb at max brightness, which is roughly equivalent to a 60 watt incandescent lightbulb. The original Hue and the Hue Downlight produce 600 lumens and 630 lumens respectively, so theoretically you’re getting brighter maximum light here, but the softer light might appear less bright than a more pure white you can get out of the adjustable rest of the range.
Overall, the Hue Lux is a good option for those looking to supplement their existing Hue setup with bulbs for their desk and floor lamps, and for other installations where they just need basic lighting without all the fancy extras like color changing in sync with media playback. If you think about the fact that you can kit out a kitchen’s worth of six overhead sockets for $180 instead of $360, that’s going to make a big difference. The Lux bulbs also use 80 percent less power than a traditional incandescent bulb, and should last a lot longer, too, with estimated life span tapped at 22 years, adding to the overall value proposition.
It’s about twice the price of the non-Hue 60W equivalent Philips of the same design, but you get the connectivity in the mix, which really increases its overall versatility. If you’re a Hue system user, or if you’ve been curious about the Philips smart bulb range, this is a great new addition to the lineup. It’s available for pre-order now through Amazon and the Apple Store in the U.S., and begins shipping in the first week of September.

454,YC-Backed UPower Is Building Nuclear Batteries,https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/18/yc-backed-upower-is-building-nuclear-batteries/,2014/08/18,"
Despite the promise of bountiful, cheap, and clean energy nuclear energy didn’t overtake fossil fuels like everyone expected them to in the middle of the 20th century. Among other things, fear of radiation leaks and waste products that have to be buried for hundreds of years turned the United States away from adopting it for more than a fraction of our energy usage.
Y Combinator batch company UPower Technologies is hoping to change that by offering reactors that cut out those factors at a scale where regulatory issues and billion-dollar construction costs aren’t a problem.
UPower founder and CEO Jacob DeWitte describes the company’s first reactor design as a plug-and-play nuclear thermal battery. The idea is that customers will order a reactor that will be shipped in a container with everything needed on the reaction side and then connected to a power conversion method that makes the most sense for the particular application. Some projects might hook it up to a steam turbine, while others might use it in concert with something much closer to a jet engine.
The reactor generates 7 MW worth of heat, which comes out to about 2 MW worth of electricity once converted. That’s enough to power 2,000 homes in places like Alaska and others with lower demand for electricity. It’s also enough to power entire mining operations or military bases in places where constantly having fuel for large diesel generators shipped is too difficult or expensive.
Radioactive waste, while still an issue due to the nature of nuclear fission, is less of a pain than with traditional power plant designs in use today. The reactor, in addition to being fuel agnostic (it can use thorium, uranium, or recycled fuel) can actually reduce the half life of existing waste, and spent fuel from it can be reused in another reactor with some processing.
UPower is running on an aggressive timetable for a startup whose main product splits atoms. DeWitte aims to get regulatory approval in about four years, with production and sales happening over the year following that approval.
He says the company’s biggest advantage in the process is that right now, they don’t need to actually operate their reactors to get to the next phase with regulators: Since the fission process is fairly well understood at this point, the company is simulating those parts of the reactor while testing focuses on the heat transfer process that makes the system so adaptable for different uses.

455,Tesla Extends All 85kWh Model S Drivetrain Warranties To 8 Years And Infinite Miles,https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/15/tesla-extends-all-model-s-drivetrain-warranties-to-8-years-and-infinite-miles/,2014/08/15,"
Tesla CEO and founder Elon Musk just announced via Twitter and the company blog that the drivetrain warranty for the 85 kWh Model S has been extended, giving it an eight-year, infinite-mile warranty to match that of the battery pack. This new warranty arrangement applies retroactively to every Model S ever produced, too, meaning it benefits both existing and new owners.


Model S drivetrain warranty increased to infinite miles, applies retroactively … http://t.co/0Gwukwj6qT
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 15, 2014



Originally, the Model S carried a four-year, 50,000-mile limited warranty that could be extended to 8 years and 100,000 miles for an additional $4,000 fee. Musk says in his blog post detailing the move that “[i]n hindsight, this should have been [Tesla’s] policy from the beginning of the Model S program,” as the company’s warranty should reflect its belief in the improved reliability of its electric engines vs. their gasoline-powered equivalents.
Musk also notes to investors in his company that this will have a (moderate) negative effect on its earnings in the short-term, but says the move is designed to benefit the company long-term, owing to how it reflects Tesla putting its customers first.
The warranty extends to new owners upon resale of the Tesla S, too, so secondary markets also benefit. This is a huge goodwill gesture for Elon to make for its customers, and yet another shot across the bow of traditional fuel-injected gas engines. The fact that it applies retroactively makes it much more than a gesture, too, as they likely could’ve easily applied it going forward and still received praise from industry observers.

456,The Fair Labor Association Delivers Its Findings On Two Apple Supplier Facilities,https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/15/the-fair-labor-association-delivers-its-findings-on-two-apple-supplier-facilities/,2014/08/15,"
Back in 2012, Apple signed up for the Fair Labor Association’s voluntary audits in order to bring more transparency to its production practices and supplier partnerships. Today, the FLA released a new report, which contains an audit of two facilities operated by supply partner Quanta in Changshu and Shanghai.
The results of the report capture a snapshot of the state of affairs at these supplier factories in August 2013, and find that there’s a decent amount of non-compliance at both facilities, ranging from problems with recruitment fees being charged by employment brokers (especially problematic at the Shanghai facility), to a situation where 62 percent of employees at the Changshu facility failed to receive a mandatory rest day at least once over a three-month period covering the fourth quarter of 2012 required by the FLA Code during busy periods, i.e. when key devices are in production.
As part of its role, the FLA has made recommendations to Apple about how to improve upon these conditions, particularly in areas where suppliers fall short of either local laws or the FLA’s own independently maintained Code of Conduct – and as the findings detail a state of affairs that is now a year old, Apple has pointed out in a statement provided to TechCrunch that it has already taken action to address some of the issues contained therein.
Apple’s statement in full:

Our suppliers must live up to the toughest standards in the industry if they want to keep doing business with Apple, which is the first and only technology company to be admitted to the Fair Labor Association. We are committed to providing safe and fair working conditions for everyone in our supply chain.
Last year we conducted 451 comprehensive, in-person audits deep into our supply chain so we could uncover problems and work with our suppliers to fix them. We track and report the weekly working hours for more than 1 million workers, and our 18-month Apple Supplier EHS Academy training program is raising the bar for environment, health and safety management in the industry.
The Quanta facilities inspected by the FLA last year were included in our 2014 Supplier Responsibility report, which we released in February. Our own experts have audited these sites 16 times, most recently last month.
In the year since the FLA’s visit, we have worked closely with Quanta to drive meaningful improvements in areas identified by both the FLA and Apple. Apple conducted four follow-up inspections on top of the annual audits of both facilities, to ensure the needed corrections are in place.
This year, through the end of July, Quanta has averaged 86 percent compliance with our 60-hour workweek. Excessive overtime is not in anyone’s best interest, and we will continue to work closely with Quanta and our other suppliers to prevent it.

Apple’s own Supplier Responsibility report also contains current information about its progress with supplier partners and partner facilities, and is current as of June of this year, including data from both FLA sources and Apple’s own audits.
Recently, Apple has stepped up its efforts to increase transparency and accountability around how it runs its business, even as it continues to prize secrecy when it comes to product pipeline. On Wednesday, for instance, it revealed a new initiative to eliminate the use of benzene and n-hexane in the final assembly process for their devices. They also launched a diversity report section of their web page, with the first edition revealing the gender and racial breakdown of their workforce.
Today’s Apple is a markedly different one from the company of years’ past, which wouldn’t even name suppliers or confirm them as such when listed elsewhere. CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly affirmed a commitment to greater transparency in Apple’s operations, and he appears to be backing up those claims with genuine action.

457,"Y Combinator And Mithril Invest In Helion, A Nuclear Fusion Startup",https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/14/y-combinator-and-mithril-invest-in-helion-a-nuclear-fusion-startup/,2014/08/14,"
Building a nuclear fusion reactor that can generate more energy than is put in to make it work is one of the biggest challenges facing engineers today. Like quantum computing, decades of research have mostly resulted in proofs of concept, not hardware that can be rolled out commercially.
So it came as a surprise to hear that Y Combinator and Mithril Capital Management are investing $1.5 million in Helion Energy, a Redmond, Washingon-based startup that says it has a plan to build a fusion reactor that breaks even on energy input and output, a challenge whose solution has been considered decades away for, well, decades. Helion CEO David Kirtley says that his company can do it in three years.
Helion was founded by four scientists working at MSNW, an organization spun-off from the University of Washington that focuses on determining the feasibility of turning plasma physics research into commercializable hardware with aerospace and power-generation applications.
When the team left to form their own company, they did so with the express intention of using electronics advancements from other fields to create a magnetic-inertial confinement fusion reactor.
That was one of the big reasons Mithril took an interest in Helion when first introduced early this year. “The founding team has spent ten years working on the problem. Between 2003 and 2009 they found many solutions that don’t work, many paths not to take,” Mithril managing general partner Ajay Royan told me on a phone call.
The team saw that the technology being built for space propulsion and the smart grid could be used to control a magnetic field that contains plasma undergoing nuclear fusion — and even “squeeze” the plasma to increase the rate of reaction.

Unlike ITER, the international effort to build the world’s largest experimental fusion reactor, Helion isn’t aiming at designing a full-scale power station. That comes with several advantages, the biggest being that they don’t think it will cost them anywhere near $50 billion to construct a reactor that achieves break-even, and full-scale plasma experiments will begin well before ITER’s new goal of 2027. Kirtly says that they estimate that reaching break-even with their design should require “just a few tens of millions of dollars.”
Instead of building at the scale of a gigawatt power station right out of the gate, the company is looking to compete with smaller, more distributed plants, like large diesel generators in regions where fuel has to be trucked in. It’s a market where the current “best” solution isn’t great and the barriers to entry are far easier to deal with than when competing with the big guys.
At the scale they’re designing for, the team thinks that it will have significant price advantages once they go to market. Their design collects charged particles with each pulse, meaning it can generate electricity without having to construct a pricey turbine in addition to the reactor. The reactor is fueled by deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen that is abundant in sea water, making it more affordable than truckloads of diesel.
In an ideal world, everything works out for Helion over the next few years. They achieve break-even, raise an Uber-like mountain of capital in a Series C to begin building factories, and begin cranking out reactors that provide reliable, emissions-free energy without any nuclear waste to dispose of. As they transition from providing a niche product for remote regions to massive power stations, the idea that we had to burn fossil fuels to sustain our way of life begins to seem quaint. Hurrah for humanity.
That long-term dream is what motivated Y Combinator president Sam Altman to begin looking for opportunities in nuclear fission and fusion one and a half years ago. “Any time you can come up with a new, cheaper source of energy, it has a huge impact on quality of life for everyone,” Altman told me earlier this week. “Clean, safe, renewable energy is the best thing you can do for the poorest half of the world.”
With all of that said, three years is a long time. All kinds of companies run in to roadblocks that lead to failure over that kind of time frame, and most of those companies aren’t building technologies on the bleeding edge of plasma physics.
Things could go according to plan for Helion. Or, it could turn out that some key ingredient to building a reactor that actually generates more power than put in is trickier than originally predicted and the company has to put another $100 million into R&D.
According to Mithril’s Royan, the partnership between Mithril and Y Combinator is intended to help Helion become a company that can survive difficulties that arise over the years to come. Mithril, which contributed “well over $1 million” to Helion’s Series A, “looks to invest in durable companies.” In my conversations with Kirtly, Altman, and Royan, each emphasized how important being part of the current YC batch is for instilling a culture that can make significant progress while being prepared to solve problems that emerge along the way.
During a period where it seems like the hottest thing is Uber for Whatever, it’s cool to see investors throw millions at companies looking to solve big issues. While it’ll probably be a few decades late (2015 is right around the corner), any push forward on nuclear fusion brings us a bit closer to this:

458,WeedMaps Partners With Uber So You Don’t 420BlazeIt And Drive,https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/13/hope-they-bring-snacks/,2014/08/13,"
Dude, where’s my car? Back in the garage because you took an Uber rather than driving high. At least that’s the idea behind leading “Yelp for marijuana” service WeedMaps and Colorado pot shop The Clinic partnering with Uber. Each time a new rider enters the promo code “clinicms”, Uber will donate $5 to multiple sclerosis research though the end of year. The campaign starts this week in hopes that no one will take take bong rips and try to pilot their hippie bus to the The Clinic-sponsored charity golf tournament this week.
This is how eager Uber is to grow. It will do anything and partner with anyone as long as it pulls in new users, no matter how high they are. From co-opting gay marriage to delivering kittens, offering plane rides or helping you commute by boat, Uber is demonstrating that it’s willing to get weird and wild in the name of marketing. You’d think Uber’s management was chiefing on that WeedMaps good-good.  But Uber’s next growth plan is no joke. Multiple sources confirm to me that Uber will soon launch an API, which could colonize the mobile landscape with “Get an Uber” buttons. So even if you get so stoned you forget what homescreen folder you put Uber in, you’ll be able to hail one of its drivers from another app. [Image Credit]

459,Uber Is About To Launch An API,https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/12/uber-api/,2014/08/12,"
Uber wins when you hit the “Request A Ride” button, so shouldn’t it try to put that button everywhere? It seemed like a smart plan, so I did some digging and now sources confirm to me that Uber plans to launch an API soon.
Google Maps was just the start. While it’s not clear what the exact functionality will be, the Uber API could potentially let partnered developers add the request button to their apps. It might even support creation of full-fledged Uber clients. Soon the methods to call Uber for a ride could become as ubiquitous as its cars themselves. 
Today, Uber has no public API. It’s got an option to set up corporate expense billing with Concur. And Re/code says Uber talked with Facebook about an integration into Messenger.
The extent of its openness is appearing as a pedestrian and public transportation option inside Google Maps to people who’ve already downloaded Uber. The “Get An Uber” button shows the travel time and distance, and a single tap fast-switches you to Uber with your destination pre-loaded.
This is smart of Uber, and a win-win since Google Ventures is a huge stakeholder in the transportation startup. It subtly reminds people that walking and public transit are slower and more arduous than a private driver.
Uber is an impulse purchase. A quick tap can cost you $20. Uber just needs you to surrender to luxury and tap the button. Hence, the more buttons, the more taps, the more money it makes and the stronger its coverage gets. That’s why an Uber API makes so much sense.
When I asked about the API, Uber declined to comment. However, mutliple sources close to Travis Kalanick’s company say a new way for third-party apps to integrate Uber is coming in the next month, though they didn’t have more details on exactly how it will work.
More In-Roads To Uber
Here’s how Uber could potentially cooperate with developers.
I’d imagine that at first it would likely only be open to a family of well-vetted partners, providing more of a semi-private API for a controlled platform than an openly available public API. Uber might just offer a “Get an Uber” button like in Google Maps, or let apps show how many minutes away the nearest driver is and if surge pricing is on.
Maybe Yelp, Foursquare, or OpenTable could let you book a one-tap ride to a restaurant. Travel apps like HotelTonight could offer an instant Uber to your bed. Navigation apps like Waze, Bing Maps, and Yahoo Maps could get integrations just like Google Maps. Even social apps like Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp could let you hail a ride to an address you’re discussing.  If the partnerships go well, Uber could potentially open up the API to more publicly to developers. They might be able to build whole skins on top of Uber that are designed for specific purposes.
There could be a cutesy version for kids that only lets them book rides home, or one for teenagers where a parent has to approve the fare quotes before a ride begins. A power user’s “uberUber” could offer faster fare quotes, let you draw the route you want to take, or let you set up rules like “alert me each weekday when there’s no surge pricing between 6pm and 7pm” to consistently get you the cheapest ride home from work.
I’d bet the Uber API will come with strict rules about how the Uber brand can be portrayed and what functionality is available. The company doesn’t want to lose its veneer of sophistication thanks to some piss-poor hacks.
Uber once blocked an app called Corral that let you compare different transportation options like Uber, Lyft, Sidecar, walking, and public transit. I wouldn’t be surprised if Uber didn’t allow this. As the market leader, it could demand exclusivity from partners. It doesn’t want you choosing between it and competitors, but instead between its different UberX, taxi black car, UberXL, and SUV price points.  As for revenue sharing, Uber might be able to convince partners and developers that an Uber button makes their app better. Alternatively, it might dispense a cut like a $1 referral fee per ride initiated.
Even if it has to dole out a revenue share, colonizing the mobile web with Uber buttons could pay big dividends. Facebook had great success with a similar plan to populate the Internet with Like buttons. They made sharing an impulse decision, sent the social network valuable content, and drove awareness even when they weren’t clicked.
Uber’s buttons could help it sprint ahead of competitors like Lyft, and cement its name as the defacto on-demand car service the way “Google” became the word for web search. Uber has spent the last 5 years working to get as many cars on the road in as many cities as possible. The goal is to minimize the time between you wanting transportation and stepping into an Uber.
The API might shave off a few seconds and get you to pull the trigger more often. If the API is a hit, Uber buttons could make every app a Manhattan street corner where you can hail a ride at any time. [Image Credit: BBDO via]

460,BMW Vs. Tesla: A Real Live Innovator’s Dilemma,https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/26/bmw-vs-tesla-is-a-real-live-innovators-dilemma-battle/,2014/07/26,"
Editor’s note: Peter Yared is the Founder & CTO of Sapho and was formerly the CTO/CIO of CBS Interactive.
Jill Lepore genereated quite a fracas in Silicon Valley with her New Yorker article that questions disruptive innovation and posits that large incumbent companies often survive and subsume disruptive technology with small incremental gains. Fortunately, we have a live Petri dish: BMW’s new electric i3 is an ongoing case study of a legacy manufacturer facing an innovator’s dilemma in the face of Tesla, a very aggressive new competitor with next-generation technology.
Elon Musk has defined the standard for a future mass-produced electric car – it must cost around $40,000, have a range of 200 miles, and be comparable to a BMW 3 series. In order to achieve that audacious goal, Tesla is embarking on a plan to build a “Gigafactory” capable of producing batteries at an efficient and lower cost that would make such a dream car feasible. Investors are betting that Tesla will be able to dominate the electric car market when it achieves scale, continuing a growth rate that values Tesla at $28 billion even though it only produces 35,000 vehicles a year. It is interesting that Musk directly compared the Tesla’s upcoming mass market Model 3 directly to the BMW 3 series, given that BMW is now delivering its new i3 to the US market in accessible volumes.
There are lots of great lessons for entrepreneurs to learn from watching the BMW versus Tesla battle since cars are so tangible and manufacturer sales tactics are so transparent.
Brand
Even though it has a “3” in its name, the i3 is decidedly not a 3 series BMW. It is two feet shorter, and should instead be in the BMW 1 series product family. The i3’s electric range of 80-100 miles makes it more similar to electric cars like the Nissan Leaf and the Chevrolet Volt and nowhere close to a technological wonder like the Tesla Model S.
Despite its limitations, the i3 is clearly resonating, with rave reviews and a price that is spiking over the last month on TrueCar, indicating high initial demand in the United States. BMW has (mis)used the power of the 3 series brand to its benefit, and can now add features like longer length and range incrementally as battery technology improves.
Lesson: Legacy companies can mislabel their products to leverage their brand, especially if an upstart compares itself directly to a particular model.

Technology
BMW invested tremendous resources in its electric car platform to develop an all-electric vehicle platform, and it is willing to integrate legacy technology in order to deliver immediate value to its customers. Conversely, Mercedes chose a partnership route and is buying the drivetrain and battery technology for its upcoming electric car from Tesla. Both BMW and Mercedes are well ahead of Tesla in advanced vehicle technology like self-parking and cruise control that can automatically follow highway lanes and maintain distance from other vehicles.
Rather than waiting for battery technology to evolve to make an all-electric car with a 200-mile range at a mid-range price point, BMW is selling an optional “range extender” consisting of a two cylinder motorcycle engine that maintains the batteries at a 5 percent power level and extends the car’s range an additional 80 miles. Since the range extender powers the batteries rather than a gas engine, the i3 is not a hybrid, but the range extender can be continually refilled so that the car is never stuck without power. It’s a total hack, but is well thought out and competitive. BMW’s engineers must have been giggling when they came up with this one.
With the i3, BMW has delivered a “good enough” luxury electric car for the urban driver and average commuter, who can also optionally use the car for longer trips without having to plan for supercharger stations.
Lesson: Legacy companies are often willing to hodgepodge new technology with their older technology to stave off new competitors.
Volume 
Tesla shipped its first car in 2006 and is expecting sell 35,000 Model S sedans in 2014, or roughly 17,500 units in the second half of 2014. BMW started selling i3’s in 2014 and sold 6,000 i3’s in the first half of the year, primarily in the European market, which now has 3 to 6 months waits for the car. Now that demand is spiking, BMW increased production to 20,000 units annually and is now producing 100 units a day, a run rate of over 30,000 units annually. The fact that a legacy manufacturer is on the verge of outselling Tesla in its own luxury electric segment in the first year of shipping is fascinating given Tesla’s superior product and years of market lead.
Lesson: Once legacy companies have hodgepodged technology, they can produce it at scale.
Sales
While Tesla is right in attempting to disrupt the antiquated dealership business model, BMW will be able to leverage its extensive dealer network to deliver to consumers worldwide, and consumers can use web services like TrueCar and Beepi to bypass the hassle of negotiating with dealers on the price of a new car and trade-in amount. BMW also has access to a deep well of financial incentives to drive consumers to buy cars. Auto manufacturers and their dealers are fighting Tesla with regulatory measures to slow the company down and limit market penetration.
Lesson: Innovators should not underestimate the power of a legacy company’s large, lumbering sales channel.
Market Entry
Tesla had to enter the market at the high-end in order to deliver batteries capable of long ranges at a margin that would deliver profits to fickle investors, years before it could deliver a mass market mid-range vehicle. BMW’s breadth enables it to enter at the mid-market and then move up into the ultra high-end next year in the U.S. with its i8 supercar. To BMW, the distinctive, urban-friendly i3 is essentially a rolling advertisement for BMW’s innovative and green future, so the company could even sell them at a loss and come out ahead.
Tesla’s high-end first approach could turn into a liability as the Tesla S is quite large and therefore not well suited for urban environments – it is wider than and almost as long as a 7 series BMW. Large, luxury four door sedans are typically purchased by upper middle class men over the age of 35 which, as a member of the demographic, I unfortunately have to admit we’re not exactly the most hip crowd. BMW examined the market thoroughly and is targeting hip, young, urban professionals with the i3’s forward design, a smaller urban-friendly size, and the brand’s proven appeal with a younger demographic.
Lesson: Legacy companies are often in numerous segments of a market and leverage their scale to beat an upstart’s roadmap.
Who Exactly Is Getting Disrupted?
The big question is what industry exactly are electric cars are disrupting? At first it seemed like the legacy auto manufacturers would not be able to step up to an electric car challenge. They have widely adopted hybrid electric cars, are now delivering somewhat competitive electric cars, and are continually experimenting with hydrogen fuel cells. From a broader view, it is possible that ExxonMobil and Chevron will be more disrupted by electric vehicles rather than BMW and Chevrolet.
Elon Musk is an entrepreneurial hero who is concurrently disrupting the passenger vehicle, space transportation and electric utility industries. Some of the legacy companies in those industries were bound to wake up at some point and respond aggressively. Fortunately, Musk can rest assured that the United Launch Alliance will not be as agile against SpaceX as BMW has been against Tesla!

461,Elon Musk’s Answer To Stephen Colbert’s Vision Of Ambient Wireless Charging: “We’ll Do It”,https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/25/elon-musks-answer-to-stephen-colberts-vision-of-ambient-wireless-charging-well-do-it/,2014/07/25,"
Last night Tesla’s Elon Musk appeared on The Colbert Report, and he discussed some of SpaceX‘s recent successes, the upcoming update for Tesla vehicles that let you name your car, as well as his general path towards supervillainy. Aside from the usual comedic hijinks, the segment also touched on some of Musk’s concepts for the future, and also on what Colbert himself wants to see in terms of the advancement of tech.
Musk articulated why it’s so important that SpaceX develop rockets that can take-off, land and then be refuelled and launch again without having to build a new rocket to do so. They also discussed the problems that have resulted from mounting tensions between Russia and the U.S., and how Russia’s refusal to continue sending astronauts to the International Space Station will benefit Musk’s space ferry service.
More interesting though are what Musk thinks the future of earth-based flight might hold: He talked about how aircraft should have vertical take-off and landing, for instance, which would be more efficient in terms of space, and which would also allow for electric-powered aircraft. There’s another great reason I’d like to see this, aside from the obvious benefits – we want our aircraft to resemble those in sci-fi movies, which almost universally take off and land vertically.
Finally, Musk opened the floor to Colbert, asking him what he’d like to see in the future – Colbert’s main request, after ditching the keyboard and mouse (Musk is already a fan of the Leap Motion Controller which enables this to some degree) was that we have wireless ambient power available in our homes, and across America via a subscription-based service so that you never have to worry about plugging in again. If it sounds familiar, it’s because that’s basically what TC Disrupt alum Ossia wants to offer with its Cota charging system, but no one has yet made a system like that that’s viable for everyday consumer use. Musk finished by conceding that “yeah, we’ll do it” however, so maybe he’ll turn his considerable talents to tackling this somewhere down the line.

462,Metromile Launches Per-Mile Car Insurance That Could Save Californians 40%,https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/16/per-mile-car-insurance/,2014/07/16,"
Plug Metromile’s free gizmo into your car and you can stop overpaying for car insurance if you’re amongst the 70% of people who drive under 10,000 miles a year. Today Metromile expands its per-mile car insurance to California following success disrupting traditional insurance in Oregon, Washington, and Illinois. It’s also revamping its free app that can tell you if something is broken in your car, help you avoid street cleaning tickets, find where you parked, and teach you better routes and schedules to minimize commute times and maximize fuel efficiency.
Metromile could make it much more affordable to own a car if you live in a city and don’t drive much. Drivers can take ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft when it’s convenient, and only pay for their insurance when they need their own car for excursions.

For details on exactly how Metromile works, read my deep dive on its launch in November. Essentially, without knowing who drove how much, car insurance companies have historically had to overcharge most people to subsidize high-mileage drivers.
But thanks to the advances in mobile technology, Metromile invented a cellular GPS telematics device that plugs into your car’s diagnostic port under the dashboard, and reports back how many miles you drive. The startup’s $14 million in funding from First Round Ventures, SV Angel, NEA, and Index Ventures let give away its telematics devices and white-label a major insurance carrier with its per-mile system.
Metromile CEO Dan Preston explains “70% of the rent associated with insurance is [from your car] rolling down the road at high speeds. Very little is associated with it being parked in your garage or on the street.” If you don’t drive much, you’re less likely to get into accidents your insurance company has to pay for, so Metromile can charge you less.
Preston tells me that “If you’re driving under 5,000 miles per year, you will save 40% to 50%” on your car insurance by switching to Metromile.
Meanwhile, those other insurance companies are locked into their antiquated business models. If they offered per-mile insurance, all their cash cow low-mileage drivers would switch to it, and they’d have to charge high-mileage drivers a higher, fairer rate. Basically their whole system would crumble.
That might happen anyways as those lucrative low-mileage drivers slip away to per-mile providers. The company tells me ” under one million people” are already using Metromile’s insurance, though it’s only been available to about 24 million people total.
It can still be a tough sell. Metromile doesn’t have the trusted brand recognition, even though its back-end is handled by a stable, $8 billion insurance company. It’s a big purchase that can scare people away from making a decision. Giving away the devices isn’t cheap, and most people overestimate how much they drive until they plug one of these devices in.
I’ll be switching to Metromile, though. I live in San Francisco and love having my car for adventures or epic journeys outside the city. But in town, I often skateboard or take Ubers and Lyfts. I’m paying way too much for insurance while my car sits in the garage, subsidizing some stranger who drives non-stop. But no more.
Drivers in California, Oregon, Washington, and Illinois can now get a two-minute quote and sign up for Metromile’s per-mile insurance if it will save them money.

463,Elon Musk Donates $1 Million To The Oatmeal’s Nikola Tesla Museum,https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/10/elon-musk-donates-1-million-to-the-oatmeals-nikola-tesla-museum/,2014/07/10,"
Back in May, cartoonist The Oatmeal (or, as his momma named him, Matthew Inman) publicly reached out to Elon Musk and asked for help in his mission to build a museum dedicated to Nikola Tesla. Musk had named a company after Tesla; surely he’d want to help with a museum in his honor, right?
Yep! At 2 A.M. the next morning, Elon responded by tweet: “I would be happy to help”.


@Oatmeal I would be happy to help
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 14, 2014



Two months later (on Nikola Tesla’s birthday, no less!), we now know what Elon’s help looks like: a cool million bucks.
According to a blog post by Inman, Musk called him up last week and pledged two things:

A Tesla supercharger would be built just outside of the museum, making the museum a part of his nationwide Tesla recharging network.
A million dollars for the development/construction of the museum

This isn’t the museum’s first big cash injection, though it’s almost certainly the largest made by an individual. The whole thing started when The Oatmeal decided to use Indiegogo to buy Tesla’s old laboratory to save it from being torn down, managing to raise roughly $1.3 million. That was enough to save the lab — but to turn it into a museum? They’d need to find roughly $8 million more. Elon’s contribution doesn’t get them all the way there, but it’s one helluva start.
Happy birthday, Nikola Tesla!


$1 million from Elon Musk! And a supercharging station! Thank you, Mr. Musk!!!

464,Fuel-Cell Cars Are Going To Get A Big Boost In California Next Year,https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/09/fuel-cell-cars-are-going-to-get-a-big-boost-in-california-next-year/,2014/07/09,"
We may not have hoverboards by October 2015, but thanks to investments from the California Energy Commission and Toyota, we’ll have something just as futuristic: the makings of a functioning hydrogen economy in California.
That month, FirstElement Fuel will open 19 new hydrogen fueling stations in the state of California with $27.2 million in grant funding from the California Energy Commission and a $7.2 million loan from Toyota. Another 9 will open in the state through grant money distributed to other proposals from the state.
With the number of hydrogen fuel stations more than quadrupling from the current 9, car companies will finally be able to release fuel cell vehicles with demonstrable advantages over battery electric vehicles.
Toyota, for instance, unveiled its fuel cell vehicle concept (pictured above at this year’s CES) in Tokyo last fall and promises it will be ready for mass production next year. The car is about the size of a Camry and has an electric motor powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. Thanks to a high-pressure tank, it’s able to store enough hydrogen gas to drive for more than 300 miles without refueling — 40 miles more than even the highest-end Tesla Model S — with no environmentally harmful emissions.
In a phone call, Toyota’s National Manager of Advanced Technologies Craig Scott explained that the technology for fuel cell vehicles has been ready for a few years now, but the infrastructure still wasn’t there to make them practical for most drivers. Even though their theoretical range is much further than electric cars with a battery, people simply wouldn’t be able to leave areas where hydrogen stations existed if they bought or leased one because the next station would be too far away.
The simultaneous expansion of hydrogen infrastructure and the release of cars that can take advantage of them from Toyota, Honda and Hyundai in 2015 will have accelerating effects on the industry overall. Because of the availability of stations, Toyota is now able to move their hydrogen platform into mass production, which brings significant cost savings as the company can start bringing in parts from its other powertrains and build fewer parts “by hand” in limited quantities.
FirstElement Fuel CEO Joel Ewanick told me this morning that there will be significant savings to future hydrogen station deployment thanks to these early investments as well. As the number of pumps increases, Ewanick told me that the cost to build a station could drop by 50% over the next decade, with fuel costs dropping by 30-40 percent. And within five years, those Ewanick says FirstElement’s stations will be profitable, as “it’s a very simple business model.”
What makes hydrogen vehicles so tantalizing is the fact that they can produce zero emissions with the range of a fossil-fuel-powered car. That zero comes with an asterisk, however: Some hydrogen is sourced in more environmentally friendly ways than others. If you’re using electricity from coal to turn water into hydrogen, it isn’t very clean.
Ewanick says that 33 percent of hydrogen at FirstElement stations in Southern California will come from renewable biogas (the minimum required by the state), while 35 percent will come from the same in the northern half of the state. “We could spend a lot more to bring that up to 100%,” he says, but the prices involved wouldn’t work well for them or drivers.
It should be noted that while there will be hydrogen stations within driving distance in most metropolitan areas of California after next year’s rollout, it’s still not going to be as convenient as filling up your car with gasoline today. As an example, here’s FirstElement’s map of upcoming stations in the Bay Area; I wouldn’t want to drive that far out of my way to fill up a car if I lived in San Francisco:

California wants to have 1.5 million zero-emission vehicles on the road by 2025, and it’s spending the money to make that happen. So far, its program to accelerate alternative and renewable fuels and technologies has invested more than $400 million in projects boosting hydrogen, biofuels, and electricity for transportation.

465,A Weekend With The All-Electric BMW i3,https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/08/a-weekend-with-the-all-electric-bmw-i3/,2014/07/08,CONTENT ERROR
466,UK Plans To Demo Robots In The Wild,https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/01/uk-robotics-strategy-2020/,2014/07/01,"
The UK’s first official robotics strategy, drawn up with help from the Technology Strategy Board (TSB), is calling for the establishment of real-world test sites over the next five+ years where robotics and autonomous systems (RAS) can be rigorously put through their paces to help speed up development of our future overlords.
The wider hope is the national strategy will accelerate robotics development in the UK which has undoubtedly lagged behind other nations when it comes to pushing the autonomous envelope.
In 2012 the UK government identified RAS as one of eight technologies it views as crucial to the future rebalancing of the economy by fostering growth and creating jobs. Today’s strategy document follows on from that move, and is the product of work by a RAS Special Interest Group set up by the TSB in 2013.
The document calls for “defined and controlled spaces” test sites to be established where robotics can be trialled in the wild, as a stepping stone on the road to RAS technologies being deployed in the real world, alongside humans and other less smart machines.
“In many markets RAS technology will face regulatory hurdles. In others, gaining social acceptance may be the key to early adoption. Such barriers are best overcome by engaging with the customer and exposing innovation to the rigours of the real world, but this can only take place in real environments; laboratories are not enough,” the strategy notes.
“The UK can kick-start RAS by taking the lead and proactively opening up its regulations to allow RAS devices to operate in defined and controlled spaces. Such a proactive step would attract inward investment, gain valuable insights and attract the best in the world to the UK.”
UK sites being considered where robots could be allowed to roam around while still in development include decommissioned nuclear sites, farms, lakes and private roads.
In tandem to establishing real-world test sites, the strategy calls for a series of RAS Grand Challenge competitions focused on “real scenarios in vertical markets” to help “stimulate collaboration, identify the possibilities, and excite the public”. So, presumably, taking a leaf from the U.S. Darpa Grand Challenge playbook.
The British robotics competitions would be hosted at the real-world RAS test sites — which the document also describes as “collaborative proving grounds” — and would aim to underpin the nascent market and help robotics startups to scale faster.
“The intention is to expose RAS technology to the rigours of real environments; to identify technical strengths and weaknesses, and to explore commercial opportunities. Where appropriate these assets and associated challenges will span sectors, encouraging increased awareness of different approaches and solutions to generic problems. This will also have the effect of increasing early stage market size, which is critical to allow SMEs to scale,” the document notes.
There’s also presumably an element of getting the Great British public used to — and less worried about — seeing bots bouncing down their country lanes, or wandering lonely as a cloud o’er their fields and lakes.
“Our vision is to reinforce a RAS ecosystem in the UK that will develop skills and allow ideas and innovation to be created and tested in the market place, ahead of international competitors,” the document adds.
“Technological innovations must be demonstrated in real world environments because RAS tools will be expected to work reliably and efficiently in these places. Addressing this will also involve shaping key regulatory and standards issues, so that success attracts private and inward investment at a tipping point when public investment is no longer needed.”
Specific RAS areas identified as having future potential in the strategy document include unmanned aircraft systems and services, such as collision detection and avoidance systems; undersea robotics, for carrying out sub-sea inspection, repair and maintenance tasks, and for performing search and recovery functions; tools and processes for nuclear remote operations in decommissioning scenarios; intelligent mobility — aka driverless cars and other smart transport systems; and also farming where RAS can be developed to reduce the use of fertilisers and pesticides, improve land use, crop yields and lessen environmental impact.

467,SF Sends Cease-And-Desist To Apps Selling Public Parking Spots,https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/23/parking-apps/,2014/06/23,"
Turns out you’re not allowed to rent away public property like parking spots as if you owned them. Parking app Monkey Parking received a cease-and-desist order today from San Francisco’s City Attorney, which has also asked Apple to remove it from the App Store for violating local law. Two other apps Sweetch and ParkModo were also warned they’d receive C&Ds.
The move could set a precedent against apps that earn money helping drivers avoid circling around looking for parking. While ridesharing services like Uber have successfully fought city laws, these parking apps may have a tougher time since they so directly break the law and charge for spots that are otherwise free or already metered.
The apps each take a different approach to selling off street parking you’ve found. Monkey Parking lets users auction off their spots. Sweetch charges drivers $5 to take over a spot, but refunds them $4 if they then transfer the spot to another Sweetch user. ParkModo planned to launch soon and hire drivers to occupy spots and then sell them to ParkModo’s paying members.
And they all sound exploitations of public resources. Under the guise of conservation and gas savings, each app tries to line its pockets and those of its users by selling something that doesn’t belong to them. Yes, it would be great if there was a more fuel-efficient way to find street parking in busy areas, and mobile apps might one day help. But layering a price atop public infrastructure seems slimy.
The apps violate Police Code section 63(c) which prohibits anyone to “enter into a lease, rental agreement or contract of any kind” for public parking spots. The violations could incur $300 penalties per transaction, which would fall on drivers. The startups themselves could face fines of up to $2,500 per transaction due to California’s Unfair Competition law that can be used against businesses entirely built on illegal business models.
City Attorney Dennis Herrera writes:
“It’s illegal, it puts drivers on the hook for $300 fines, and it creates a predatory private market for public parking spaces that San Franciscans will not tolerate. Worst of all, it encourages drivers to use their mobile devices unsafely — to engage in online bidding wars while driving. People are free to rent out their own private driveways and garage spaces should they choose to do so. But we will not abide businesses that hold hostage on-street public parking spots for their own private profit.”
Herrera copied Apple’s legal department on the letter, asking it to remove the parking apps for violating local law and being dangerous.
Unless one has the money to fight the case, parking in San Francisco’s congested districts the Mission and Marina will remain a frustrating chore. But at least the situation will remain a more egalitarian first-come-first-serve model rather than letting wealthier smartphone users shut out other citizens.

468,Harley-Davidson Might Be Making An Electric Motorcycle,https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/18/harley-davidson-might-be-making-an-electric-motorcycle/,2014/06/18,"
A mysterious video released on Harley-Davidson’s YouTube channel today shows a much quieter motorcycle zooming down Route 66, fueling speculation that this bike is electric.

Harley fans were already suspicious after the folks at Visor Down leaked of one of the possible bikes on the set of the new Avengers movie a few days ago.
The Harley is a symbol of the open road and the Hells Angels. This seems like a watered-down version of all that is Harley-Davidson and America to some.
All of this is, of course, just speculation for now.
The video title says “06.19.14.” Probably not coincidentally, the Harley crew is set to make a big announcement about its next hog tomorrow.
Update: The crew from Milwaukee confirmed with TechCrunch today that Harley Davidson is, indeed, releasing an electric motorcycle. The LiveWire, an electric-powered cycle with a jet engine whirr, will be out in stores in about a year.

Shares of SolarCity jumped 17.58 percent in regular trading today, as investors applauded its decision to purchase solar-panel manufacturer Silevo, which had plans to build a factory in New York. SolarCity intends to build the plant and scale it to “capacity greater than 1 GW within the next two years.”
The deal tipped the scales at a total of $350 million, with $150 million of that coming as earnouts that will be paid provided the “achievement of certain milestones,” according to an SEC filing. SolarCity ended the day worth just under $6 billion.
Investors loved the idea. SolarCity has long installed solar technology, but has not built panels. The goal, according to Elon Musk, an investor in the company, is to develop panels that will allow for “unsubsidized solar power to cost less than grid electricity from coal or fracked gas.”
To pull that off, SolarCity essentially thinks that it can not only build better panels, but that the market will accept the new supply. The company noted in its blog post that announced the deal that “there is excess supplier capacity today” in the solar panel industry. So this is a material wager.
According to a recent Form 4, Elon Musk owns about 21,044,146 shares in the company, which are worth, after today’s price pop, around $1.36 billion. Musk, along with other shareholders, had a pretty good day.

Elon Musk’s SolarCity has acquired Silevo, a solar panel manufacturing and design firm that produces low-cost, high-output photovoltaic cells, the company announced today. The deal will help SolarCity “achieve a breakthrough” in solar power pricing thanks to “massive economies of scale,” according to a blog post on the SolarCity website.
Already, the company is talking to the state of New York regarding the construction of an initial manufacturing facility. These talks were already in progress with Silevo pre-acquisition, according to SolarCity, and is targeting an output capacity of more than 1 Gigawatt over the next couple of years, which would make it one of the largest producers in the world. Long-term, the plan is to roll out multiple bigger production facilities with capacity “an order of magnitude” greater than the first. Musk says the end goal is to make solar power incredibly affordable for all:


Goal is for unsubsidized solar power to cost less than grid electricity from coal or fracked gas
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 17, 2014



SolarCity was founded in 2006 by Peter and Lyndon Rive, with input and advice from their cousin Musk. It provides power for residential, business and government customers, builds electric vehicle charging stations and also leases solar installations to customers to offset installation costs. The Silevo installation makes it a manufacturer, too, which could help it really ramp up the pace of its mission to replace use of other, less environmentally friendly energy types.
Musk is really putting his foot down on the gas regarding his plans to replace inefficient and harmful energy sources across the businesses he either runs or has a hand in. Just last week, Musk’s Tesla electric vehicle company announced that it would be open-sourcing all patents it holds regarding EV tech, making it free for competitors to use the patents in their own designs. The started reason was that Tesla alone couldn’t do the job of replacing fossil fuel-burning transport in the world fast enough.

471,The Tesla Model X SUV Is Coming In Early 2015 With Gull-Wing Doors,https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/16/the-tesla-model-x-suv-is-coming-in-early-2015-with-gull-wing-doors/,2014/06/16,"
Reservation holders for the Tesla Model X received notice today that the electric SUV will hit the production lines early next year. Best of all, Tesla confirms in this email that the gull-wing doors will make the production model and all models will feature all-wheel drive and there will be an option for a third row of seating. These are big updates, but they shouldn’t come as a surprise. Because, you know, Tesla.
Tesla is the master at under-promising and over-delivering. Generally, in the automotive world, car companies load concept cars with pie-in-the-sky features — like gull-wing doors — and then remove them from the production model. But not Tesla. With the Model S, the company showed off rear-facing seats and few automotive pundits expected the option to be available on the production model. Yet they are. And now, with the Model X, the gull-wing doors were the marquee feature of the concept car and, surprisingly, will be the marquee feature of the production car.
What wasn’t announced is when the Model X will ship, only that models for reservation holders will be produced in early 2015. Historically, Tesla has taken a conservatively approach to manufacturing as the company was much more lean when the Roadster and Model S first hit the lines. Still, spinning up a manufacturing facility to full capacity takes time, so the Model X might not be available for general purchase until much later in 2015. But gull-wing doors!

When you think of car sharing, you probably think of names such as ZipCar, City CarShare, Relay Rides and Getaround. What may not come to mind is BMW. The German luxury car company is typically known for selling cars for tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars — not renting them out by the minute.
But it turns out BMW has been in the car sharing space for a couple of years now, with a small but growing program called DriveNow. DriveNow, which is active in five German cities and the San Francisco Bay Area, lets people rent electric BMWs by the minute. 
I thought it was an interesting and somewhat unexpected initiative coming from BMW, so I met up with DriveNow’s CEO Richard Steinberg to learn about the program and why the company is getting into car sharing, and see how it measures up to other car sharing services. Check that out in the video above.

473,Tesla Promises To Not Sue Anyone Using Its Technology,https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/12/tesla-promises-to-not-sue-anyone-using-their-technology/,2014/06/12,"
Tesla has open-sourced its patents on electric vehicle technology, according to a post on the company’s blog by CEO Elon Musk.
Musk explains that one of the company’s biggest goals is to move the entire electric vehicle market forward, which it can’t accomplish if it’s making it harder for others to enter the space:
Tesla Motors was created to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport. If we clear a path to the creation of compelling electric vehicles, but then lay intellectual property landmines behind us to inhibit others, we are acting in a manner contrary to that goal. Tesla will not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, in good faith, wants to use our technology.
This news comes just days after Musk revealed that he wants to share the technology behind Tesla’s Supercharger plug-in stations with other auto manufacturers to create a standard that every electric car owner will know they can rely on when traveling.
It’s an interesting strategy. Helping others catch up on performance and range makes Tesla a less attractive option for those looking to specifically buy into the electric car market.
But if electric cars get better across the board, it might expand the pool of people who’d even consider buying one. With its reputation for industry-leading design, Tesla is in a good position to soak up a significant portion of that growth.
The move is reminiscent of Twitter’s Innovator’s Patent Agreement, announced back in 2012. Twitter promises that it won’t use its trove of patents to sue a competitor without permission from the actual inventor of a patent. It’ll only hold on to patents to make sure it won’t get sued by someone with a giant collection of them.
At a time when it seems like everyone is suing each other to try to get some kind of a leg up on the competition, it’s good to see influential companies deciding to step away from the fray.

474,Tesla Wants To Open Its Supercharger Standard To Other Electric Car Makers,https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/09/tesla-wants-to-open-its-supercharger-standard-to-other-electric-car-makers/,2014/06/09,"
Elon Musk is willing to share the technology behind his Tesla Superchargers, the fast-charging plug-in stations for his company’s electric cars, the CEO revealed at the UK launch of the Model S this past weekend (via Engadget).
Musk said he’d be willing to open up the designs in order to build a standard that can be used interchangeably across the industry. This would allow competing electric car models to charge up at the Supercharger network that already dots the U.S. and beyond.
Musk has some caveats for potential partners, however: Anyone looking to use the network would also have to embrace Tesla’s free power for life model, wherein the costs of the electricity itself used to power the vehicles is built into the car’s initial price tag, instead of charged on a repeating basis every time someone wants to fill up. They’d also have to chip in with maintenance costs for Supercharger stations, which Musk says aren’t all that steep anyway. Most Supercharger locations are provided to the company without any rent charges because they’re seen as a way to attract EV owners who essentially become a captive audience for the business while refuelling.
It’s unlikely to go so smoothly as Musk offering and his competitors accepting. But the fact that he’s apparently willing to hand over access to what amounts to a strong early-mover advantage shows that his priorities lie in ensuring there’s strong infrastructure in place for EV transport to really get a secure foothold in a market traditionally not friendly to its existence.

475,Tesla Wins Back The Right To Sell Direct To Consumers In New Jersey,https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/06/tesla-wins-back-the-right-to-sell-direct-to-consumers-in-new-jersey/,2014/06/06,"
Electric car company Tesla can now once again sell cars direct to consumers in New Jersey (via Engadget), after a ban earlier this year based on an old (and mostly irrelevant in this case) law enabled Governor Chris Christie to bow to pressure from local auto dealers to get sales of Elon Musk’s magical future cars put on hold.
A new bill passed by the New Jersey Assembly Consumer Affairs Committee unanimously allows Tesla to start selling cars through its two existing dealers in New Jersey, and gives them permission to open up to two more. The bill applies to all zero-emission vehicle makers, giving them the right to open up to four showrooms in New Jersey.
New Jersey had become the third state to ban the direct-sales model, following Arizona and Texas. The ban prompted Tesla to respond with an angry blog post accusing Christie of expediting the process and ignoring a previous promise to settle the matter through due process in the legislature. Tesla CEO Elon Musk later took to his blog to officially oppose the ban and discuss the company’s possible legal options in having the ban overturned.
The bill is good news, but that four-dealership limit might be the next part up for scrutiny or opposition, especially if Tesla or other zero emission vehicles become more affordable and/or more popular with consumers than they are now.

476,This Algae Battery Could Power A Tesla With 200X The Charge,https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/30/this-algae-battery-could-power-a-tesla-with-200x-the-charge/,2014/05/30,"
In a small lab, near a lake at the edge of West Berkeley, sits the prototype of what could revolutionize battery power as we know it. The secret to this power? Algae.
OK, just hang with me here. Lots of research has already been done on algae’s possible power capabilities. Prototype creator Adam Freeman says this new kind of battery, the one he’s working on, could power even a Tesla. And he says it could do it 200X greater than the current lithium-based battery used today.
He’s created a research company called alGAS that aims to prove just that.
Freeman says the algae battery also charges faster and lasts longer than current ion batteries used in, say, your cell phone, iPad… or a Tesla. As Freeman explains, paper-thin fibers in algae provide an easier surface for ions to get through, resulting in a charge in as little as 11 seconds, not minutes or hours.
Here is how a current battery charges, using lots of what we currently mine may be going extinct or, worse, cause cancer:

Though there isn’t much by way of illustration to show how this works for algae, Ryan Bethencourt, founder of the Berkeley BioLabs, was able to send me this brief video that sort of explains the process:



Previous tests prove algae has a charge and could theoretically work as battery power, but what’s not known is how much of a charge and how much of it will be needed to power, say, a car. Freeman believes he’s figured out the answer. What he needs now is the funding to bring it into mass production.
Those materials currently used in ion batteries (cell phones, etc.) — 95 percent of which are shipped from China — are hard to extract. This makes them quite expensive.
Tesla pledged to use U.S. materials only, which does cut the cost. Still, it’s got to be more than what it costs to grow and use algae powered batteries, right? Right, according to Freeman. He says he only needs $1,500 for the prototype and that he can have his algae battery ready for mass production for a mere $5,000 by this summer.
The implications for this go beyond cars. In theory you could power your entire house. Yes, a living, breathing algae plant could make your house “go.” A French biochemist already powered a streetlight with the stuff.
What makes Freeman’s prototype different from previous tests is the use of a bio-safe polymer. The polymer is a critical element that binds the fibers together to create a better interaction with the electron charge.
While the prototype is still basically just a bunch of jars full of algae on the shelf of some lab, the potential, according to Freeman, is very big.
“Think of driving your car on a living battery that charges in seconds with a battery that costs almost nothing and is actually good for the environment.”

477,Spor Solar-Powered Battery Charger Wants To Kickstart A Cooler Clean-Energy Ecosystem,https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/30/spor/,2014/05/30,"
There are scores of solar-powered battery chargers on the market already, offering a greener alternative to juice up your devices. But these chargers often fail to live up to expectation — either being very bulky to carry around or taking ages to charge your device.
Solar efficiency is improving, though, and the cost of producing solar cells is also coming down. And those improvements should start to trickle down into better portable solar chargers in the coming years.
On that score, meet Spor: a portable solar-powered battery charger that wants to shake things up with its fuss-free, compact form factor that’s still capable of delivering a power punch.
It’s also aiming to look a lot less boring than the generic competition — with a shell that can be customised via home 3D printing, if that’s your bag. Making solar tech look a bit cooler is certainly a worthy goal if it means getting more people to get on board with the idea of reducing their energy consumption.
Each 8.2cm x 8.2cm x 2.4 cm Spor contains a 5,300mAh battery which it uses to juice up the gizmos you plug into its two output ports (so you can charge two devices at once if you choose), and a small monocrystalline solar panel.
Its battery can be charged passively, via the Spor’s solar cell (which can either be charged by sunlight or indoor light if it’s bright enough), or by plugging Spor into a wall outlet — much like you would a spare battery pack. But this is a spare that can self-charge if you let it catch some rays.
Spor currently outputs 1 amp to devices you plug into it, which its makers say is the market standard. But they are aiming to raise that to 2 amps per port on the shipping product.
Another point of difference vs current gen solar chargers is that multiple Spors can be daisy-chained together in order to build up greater capacity — so you can output more.
A single Spor apparently takes 1.5 hours to fully charge an iPhone. Chain up multiple Spors and the charge rate won’t change but more devices can be charged in tandem.
In terms of charging up the Spor, one Spor takes two to three hours to charge from a wall outlet. If you’re hoping to charge it entirely from sunlight that would take some 50 hours. Or the best part of a week’s worth of sunny days. So not exactly speedy. But sunlight offering a top-up/back-up option for your spare battery pack means the Spor could still offer users in developed markets some convenience.
The team is also designing larger solar panels that can be used in conjunction with Spors to create small-scale solar grids. That use case is being envisaged as a way to bring cleaner, distributed off-grid energy options to developing markers. The larger solar panel could act as the hub device for charging up multiple Spors, which then become useful on an individual level, offering portable energy.
“A micro grid could consist of just a 5w panel technically and would cost somewhere between $20-$30 for a developing market. This would be cheaper than setting up some of the more complicated village wide micro grids that use centralized storage and power lines to connect each dwelling. Giving each dwelling a Spor for storage and use would give each villager autonomy over their own energy generation and use,” explains Spor co-founder David Hunt.
Other ideas the team has involve adding Bluetooth to future Spors so smartphone users can track and measure their energy generation, and even be given rewards to incentivize use. It’s also looking at ways to bypass the need for inverters or charge controllers so it can make larger capacity (100w) direct USB solar panels.
All that’s the big vision. For now Spor is a prototype as its makers look to raise $100,000 on Kickstarter to step things up from their current prototype to commercial production. At the time of writing they have raised $23,000 with 30 days left of their campaign to run.
On the cost front, the Spor is currently $40 for early bird Kickstarter backers, rising to $50 once all the lower priced pledges are snapped up. So it is a bit more expensive than some of the generic competition. But then buying something branded cool typically entails a premium.
In addition to the Spor, the team has also come up with some suitable snazzy accessories in the form of different charger cables to pair with Spor, including coloured nylon fabric or gooseneck cables which allow you to stand the device up to catch more rays.

Google has released some new research about it efforts to maximize performance and minimize energy use at data centers through machine learning today. Long story short: Google is building superintelligent server farms that can learn from their past performance and improve themselves in the future.
Google’s AI data centers are a 20 percent project – the result of an employee, Jim Gao, working on something he found interesting that falls outside of his standard job description. Google is famous for allowing its employees 20 percent of their work time to come up with passion projects and things that they wouldn’t otherwise be able to work on. Thinking, learning data centers happened to be Gao’s main area of interest.
Gao researched machine learning and then worked on building models that take in a huge amount of data Google was already tracking about its data centers including how much energy is being used at any given time by servers and other equipment, outside air temperature and more. Computers then crunch all this data, analyzing the interplay that may be impossible for a human mind to grasp, and predicting Power Usage Effectiveness, or how to use available power most efficiently for maximum computing return.
The model means that where once Google had to shut down entire server banks in order to perform service or for other reasons, it can now temporarily tweak another variable like cooling in order to maintain a much higher general level of output, saving time, energy and money.

479,Apple Patents Solar Panels Integrated Into Flexible Touch Displays,https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/20/apple-patents-solar-panels-integrated-into-flexible-touch-displays/,2014/05/20,"
Apple has a new patent that could pave the way for future solar-powered mobile devices, according to AppleInsider. The new intellectual property describes a method for embedding a solar array within a layer that includes touch sensors, and which can all be fit within a flexible display module, in order to save space in its ever-shrinking electronic devices.
The patent is a modified version of one granted to the company previously, which described the same thing but for touch-sensitive surfaces that didn’t include a display in their makeup. Instead, it described the system but for touch-sensitive surfaces only, giving it limited utility value in contemporary devices.
One version of the tech described in the patent would actually have the solar cells facing away from the touch sensor component (and/or display). This would work by routing light to the sensor through other means, including holes and ports that permit light to enter, and even fiber optic materials to reroute it from the front of the device within.
This is a key tech if Apple were ever genuinely interested in building a solar-powered iPhone or iPad. Given the output of solar-powered devices currently, and the immense power-requirements of mobile devices that feature high-quality displays, it seems very unlikely the company will introduce a fully solar-powered iOS gadget anytime soon, but this could also act as a supplemental tech that helps extend battery life rather than replace charging altogether.

In one of the loveliest paeans to modern technology ever penned on the web, The Oatmeal creator Matthew Inman posted a lengthy comic describing what it’s like to own a Tesla Model S, and it was nothing short of effusive. He did take issue with the car’s name, however, and offered up some helpful suggestions for alternate titles. The final product is easily one of the best and most clearly explained reviews of the Tesla S to date, in case you want to take a gander, but Inman also took the opportunity to ask Tesla’s founder, Elon Musk, to help fund the creation of his Tesla museum project, which previously raised nearly $1.5 million on Indiegogo.
Inman originally sought the funding necessary to help buy the property where inventor and car company namesake Nikola Tesla had a workshop in New York state. The campaign managed that successfully, Inman says, but there are still a lot more funds needed to actually build a museum on the spot, hence the new ask for an additional $8 million. Inman targets Musk for the additional funds in a second page to his Tesla comic, and explains his reasoning for doing so: Musk is a billionaire who buys submarine cars.
The combination of glowing praise and friendly wealth shaming seems to have paid off: Musk tweeted this morning that he’d be glad to chip in.


@Oatmeal I would be happy to help
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 14, 2014



That bodes well for the future of the Tesla museum, even if the full details of how Musk intends to help aren’t yet known. Regardless, this tribute to one of the greatest inventors in human history is shaping up to be one of the most interesting sagas (and hopefully results) in crowdfunding.

Power is readily available for most people in North America these days, which can make it hard to grasp how annoying it can be when it isn’t – especially if you’re trying to run a business. TechCrunch Battlefield NY 2014 competitor Simply Grid aims to offer power from the established electrical grid in situations where people would otherwise have to use gas-powered generators or other more expensive alternatives.
The first use cases that Simply Grid is working with are providing power to food carts like hot dog vendors, and also to idling vehicles, like emergency services providers and repair/utility trucks. Before, these vehicles and food carts had to employ costly gas generators, or simply run their engines (which ends up adding a lot of wear to a vehicle) in order to stay powered on, heated, and ready to operate.
“In New York, just about on every other corner there’s a Halal cart, or a hot dog cart or a coffee and pastry cart,” explained Simply Grid COO and founder Jeffrey Hoffman. “And these guys are sitting there running those little two kilowatt generators to power their carts, their blenders, lighting and all this type of stuff. These are really expensive to run, and cost about $5,000 or $6,000 to run per year for them to operate and fuel those, plus you’re looking at something that produces a tremendous amount of pollution.”

Instead, Simply Grid offers simply stations that connect to the existing power grid in frequently used locations on the street. Food cart vendors essentially have staked territories that they return to over and over again, so it’s fairly easy to install the permanent locations that Simply Grid uses to get them connected. Service and emergency vehicles likewise tend to park and idle in the same areas while doing their work, so it’s a matter of consulting with the agencies involved to figure out where to place them.

Each installation costs a few thousand dollars, with costs varying depending on whether the spot is located on private or public land, how far away it is from a mains to tap into, and so on. Once set up, it works by offering vehicles a place to plug into, and then once those people unplug and send a message to stop their billing, they’re charged for the amount of power used. With emergency vehicles, there’s a way for it to automatically shut down provision of power when the vehicle departs to make the whole process easier.
The company is currently looking at possible expansion into powering refrigeration units at huge delivery depots like Hunts Point Market in the Bronx. The opportunity here is to simplify and make green a process that has been super expensive, complicated and terrible for the environment in the past, and Simply Grid has leveraged tech new and old to make that happen.
Q&A
Q: What are your margins like?
A: They’re reasonable.
Q: What exactly is your product, is it the hardware, software, both? What’s your core competitive advantage?
A: Yes it’s all of the above. We’ve got really good hardware, we’ve got patents on the hardware we built for the fire department. Our cost of building the control system is only a couple hundred bucks, which is much better than competing tech.
Q: 20 years from now, will you be all over, or will you dominate a single market?
A: We’re strong in solving the problems for municipalities and I think that’s where we’ll excel.
Q: How long is the payback period? What’s the cost after the payback period?
A: Depends on location and other factors, and the cost can still offer 70 percent margins and people are happy to pay that.

482,Ambri Raises $35 Million For A New Approach To Grid-Scale Power Storage,https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/30/ambri-raises-35-million-for-a-new-approach-to-grid-scale-power-storage/,2014/04/30,"
The use of renewable energy is growing in the U.S., but its adoption has put pressure on old, overtaxed power grids. The intermittency of wind and solar power means that transmission systems need to find a way to store the energy generated from renewables to provide predictable power for grid operators.
The latest company to try its hand at solving the problem for utilities is Ambri, which just raised $35 million in new capital from new investors KLP Enterprises, the family office of Karen Pritzker and Michael Vlock, and the Swiss insurance company Building Insurance Bern. Previous investors Khosla Ventures, Bill Gates, and the energy company Total also participated in the financing.
Cambridge, Mass.-based Ambri is wading into some treacherous waters. Bankruptcies at Xtreme Power and A123 Energy show that building batteries for the grid can be a tricky business.
Despite the risk, investors remain undeterred. Ambri’s financing follows on the heels of a big $55 million investment by Bill Gates and others into Aquion Energy , which is also tackling the problem of large-scale energy storage.
With its latest financing, Ambri will deliver its first commercial systems to customers, build its initial commercial scale manufacturing plant, and continue technology development. The company has agreements in place to build prototype storage systems in Massachusetts, Hawaii, New York and Alaska, alongside project partners that include First Wind, Hawaiian Electric, Joint Base Cape Cod, Con Edison, Energy Excelerator (Hawaii) and Raytheon, the company says.
Previously known as the Liquid Metal Battery Corporation, Ambri is developing its battery technology from research conducted by Dr. Donald Sadoway, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, alongside Dr. David Bradwell — Ambri’s chief technology officer and co-founder. Since its launch in 2012 the company has raised over $50 million and holds the only license for the liquid metal battery technology developed by MIT.
MIT has long-dominated The research on campus has been supported by the US Department of Energy’s ARPA-E program, Total, the Deshpande Center, and the Chesonis Family Foundation. Ambri has also received grants from the Office of Naval Research and the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center.
“Ambri’s solution is highly distinguished from others in the marketplace on cost and performance –- thanks to a simple manufacturing process, use of cheap and safe materials, and significantly longer lifetime compared to other approaches we’ve seen,” says Andrew Chung, a partner at Khosla Ventures and director on the Ambri board, in a statement.
Despite the lean times and bad press that the cleantech industry has faced, Khosla has remained consistent in its investment thesis around the promise of renewable energy and energy-efficiency technologies.
It is by far the sector that has raised the most money in the Khosla portfolio, according to data from CrunchBase.

483,Google Commits $100M To Help Finance Residential Solar Installs With SunPower,https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/23/google-commits-100m-to-help-finance-residential-solar-installs-with-sunpower/,2014/04/23,"
Fresh off its agreement to purchase up to 407 MW of wind power for its Iowa data center, Google today announced that it has committed $100 million to create a new fund to help finance the purchase of residential solar installations with SunPower Corporation.
The fund, which will also include $150 million from SunPower, is meant to enable a scheme that is similar to what other residential solar companies currently offer: The fund will purchase the solar panels homeowners will be able to lease these solar systems at a cost that is lower than their normal electricity bill.
SunPower’s current program has brought solar panels to about 20,000 U.S. households, and the company expects that this new fund will add “thousands” more. SunPower makes the panels itself and handles the installation for homeowners.
“We’re pleased to team with SunPower to make solar power accessible to more homeowners, and offer families a more effective way to reduce their carbon footprint,” said Kojo Ako-Asare, head of corporate finance at Google in a statement today.  “Google is committed to promoting the efficient use of resources and expanding the use of renewable energy. Our partnership with SunPower makes good business sense and supports our goals for a clean energy future.”
This marks Google’s 16th renewable energy investment and its third in residential rooftop solar. It previously committed $280 million to create a similar fund with SolarCity and also committed $75 million to a fund with Clean Power Finance to bring solar to about 3,000 homeowners.

484,Google Signs A 407 MW Wind Energy Deal For Its Iowa Data Center,https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/22/google-signs-a-407-mw-wind-energy-deal-for-its-iowa-data-center/,2014/04/22,"
It’s Earth Day, so there isn’t a company on the Internet that isn’t trying to brandish its green image. Apple led the charge earlier this week and today, Google announced that it has inked a deal with MidAmerican Energy to supply its $1.5 billion Iowa data center with up to 407 megawatts of 100 percent renewable wind energy.
This is the company’s sixth and largest green energy power purchase agreement so far and brings its total amount of contracted renewable energy to over 1,000 MW. MidAmerican Energy will supply Google’s data center with power from a number of its wind farms, including its new Wind VIII site, which — once construction wraps up next year — will consist of 448 wind turbines.
“Google’s significant and growing presence within our service area, along with its long and demonstrated commitment to renewable energy, have been important factors in MidAmerican Energy’s pursuit of renewable power,” said Bill Fehrman, president and CEO of MidAmerican Energy, in a statement today. “In addition to increasing Google’s access to renewable energy, this agreement also reduces energy costs for our customers.”
Google previously signed a very similar agreement with an Oklahoma utility in 2012 and earlier this year, it announced that it had come to a similar agreement with a Swedish utility to power its Finnish data center. The company has also invested about $1 billion in 15 green energy projects around the world.
Iowa — just like Oregon — has become a magnet for data centers recently thanks in large part to the availability of generous tax breaks and access to affordable and renewable energy, with Google, Facebook and Microsoft making heavy investments in the area.

485,Cota Wireless Power Solution Improves With Long Range Charging Through Closed Doors,https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/22/cota-wireless-power-solution-improves-with-long-range-charging-through-closed-doors/,2014/04/22,"
Disrupt Battlefield alumnus and wireless power pioneer Ossia has made some new advances with its Cota tech that it showed off to investors recently, including extended range and the ability to transmit without direct line-of-sight, making it much closer to becoming a practical everyday technology suitable for general use. The startup can now charge a smartphone from a distance of 40-feet, through a variety of surfaces including walls and closed doors.
That’s impressive because it means the tech is getting much nearer to where it needs to be to ship as a consumer-focused product. The plan is currently to unveil the next-generation prototype of the tech to the public later this year, which will incorporate these latest advancements to its tech. Ossia is currently working with consumer electronics makers using the Cota tech under license to incorporate receivers in new products, which will work in tandem with Cota transmitters to charge gadgets wirelessly and in the background, using communication similar to that which occurs now between your devices and Wi-Fi routers.
The vision is for a single Cota transmitter to charge or power all the devices in a an average single-family home or small office suite. It works using ultra-low power beacon signals to find and identify power-needing devices, and then transmitting charging signals to said devices using more energy, but still no more than you’d expend making a phone call with a smartphone, for instance. Adding improved capabilities through solid surfaces means Cota is better able to extend its reach to a whole office or home from a single central hub.
Other potential applications, including powering sensors and monitors on factory floors, will also require improved range and reach, so it’s promising to see the company making progress in that direction.

Apple has a new full-page ad appearing in some print newspapers today (via 9to5Mac), and it celebrates the company’s environmental record while simultaneously digging slyly at Samsung, its longtime rival and current opponent in court. The ad features the phrase “There are some ideas we want every company to copy,” and has been spotted in The Metro and The Guardian to name just a few sources.
Apple ad on back cover of this morning's Metro: 'There are some ideas we want every company to copy'. http://t.co/RNbgBNtjHZ— David McClelland (@DavidMcClelland) April 22, 2014
Apple’s ad also includes copy that makes it clear Apple is talking about efforts like using 100% renewable energy sources to power its massive data centers, and its use of materials made without ingredients that include harmful toxins in building its devices. The ad is overlayed on top of an image of the solar farm that Apple built to power its data center in Maiden, North Carolina.

The crux of Apple’s court battle against Samsung over the past few years has essentially been that the Korean company copied all of its designs in building their own line of Galaxy smartphones and tablets. That’s also a common criticism echoed in the media and among consumers. This year, Apple has made a special point of highlighting its environmental record and new initiatives as part of today’s Earth Day celebrations, with a new website and video featuring CEO Tim Cook.

Apple has been one of the top performers in the most recent Greenpeace rankings of Internet companies thanks the clean energy sources they use to power their data centers. The company is keen to emphasize its green side, especially leading up to April 22 (Earth Day) this year, and now a new video narrated by CEO Tim Cook highlights some of its key environmental initiatives.
The video centers around the concept of “Better,” and what that means with respect to Apple’s products not only in terms of their technical design, but in terms of what they’re doing to minimize packaging, use more environmentally friendly components, and create large-scale facilities that use wind power and avoid dirty, non-renewable energy sources like coal. The video also expresses a renewed commitment to doing more of the same in the future.
The green stuff is great, and I applaud Apple’s efforts, but the beginning of this video with inside-looks at how the chamfered edges on the iPhone 5s are made, plus stress tests on iPad display panels and iPhone home buttons offer some of the more interesting visuals of the piece, even if you’re not necessarily all that interested in Apple’s green initiatives.

488,The 3D Printing Landfill Of Opportunity,https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/20/plastic-problem/,2014/04/20,"
There are lots of reasons to love 3D printing. It democratizes manufacturing, putting consumers in granular control of the things they own — rather than requiring them to choose from a finite pre-made selection.
The additive manufacturing technology also extrudes a bridge linking creativity and utility. You can turn a sketch on paper into a 3D object that can be held, turned, admired. You can clone a cherished object you already own to create a spare. Or print a spare part to fix something that’s broken. And you can do all this without having to send off for third-party assistance. So long as you have the skills to use the 3D design software or the 3D scanner, a 3D printer and a suitable physical substance to feed into your personal making machine.
However there’s a flip-side to this freedom. The detritus that will inevitably be created simply because it’s possible to print a physical object at the click of a button. Many 3D printed objects used to demo the potential of the tech are effectively just trinkets — the kind of throwaway trash you get in the average Christmas cracker.
That will hopefully change — as 3D printers (and the materials they use) get better and more capable, meaning the quality of the the output increases, and (hopefully) the utility, longevity and sustainability of the objects printed will too. And indeed as consumers find genuine real-world utility for 3D printing. But in the short term the rise of cheaper 3D printers is going to fuel a boom in sub par machines that churn out cheap plastic trash. Just because they can.
Nasa testing 3D printed metal rocket engine components is one interesting example where additive manufacturing technology has the potential to reduce the associated costs (and waste) of traditional manufacturing. But that’s an in industrial use-case at the very high end of the price spectrum.
At the consumer product level, humanity already has a massive waste problem when it comes to plastics. We use too much plastic. We throw far too much away. Plastic already contaminates huge tracts of land and ocean. And the rise in ownership of low cost consumer 3D printers risks sparking a new boom for the stuff — reeling in spools of shiny coloured filament to gratify our magpie appetites.
It’s not necessarily as simplistic as that though. Mass uptake of consumer 3D printers might end up displacing and replacing the production of some cheap plastic trash — by devaluing some of the pre-made baubles consumes can currently buy in 99 cent stores and the like. Why buy a novelty plastic keyring when you can print one that has your own face on it? So the plastic mountain that’s fueling that landfill-generating class of products might end up being diverted to the 3D printer market, where there is at least a better chance of the end-user wanting to hold on to the trinket they’ve made — since whatever they printed was customised to their personal preferences.
But the risk is still that people print disposable things just because they can. And that more and more of this transient stuff gets conjured into existence — requiring us or our environment to deal with its disposal. To reiterate, the risk is that a new mountain of electro-generated junk is created by a new generation of machines that fuel our appetite for a contaminating material exactly when we should be trying to pare back our usage of it.
Indeed, this post was triggered by being sent what can only be described as a abject waste of plastic, by a company hoping to use it to highlight its capabilities. This 3D printed PR object was a customised ‘designer’ plastic egg — pictured above and below in a wastebin for illustrative purposes (I’m attempting to return it to the company in question so they can recycle the plastic). So basically instead of emailing a digital press release, this company’s marketing spend generated a lump of pointless plastic trash. That’s exactly what this fledgling space needs to avoid.
It’s worth noting that different kinds of 3D printer filament do already exist — and PLA filament, for example, is compostable and biodegradable (being made from plant starch). But it still generates the greenhouse gas methane as it decomposes. Meanwhile the common ABS filament is petroleum based — ergo it’s non-biodegradable (although it can be recycled).
There are some 3D-printing related counter-currents to a future increasingly contaminated with increasing quantities of plastic waste. One interesting development last year was a 3D printer that uses slices of paper (combined with glue) as its fuel for building up a 3D object. If the glue being used was non-toxic and water-based that could provide an interesting alternative to producing transient 3D objects from plastic filament, which could ultimately be recycled along with your standard household paper waste.
Another effort on the 3D printing materials side, called Laywood, is a filament made by a German company that’s comprised of 40% recycled wood (combined with binder polymers so it can be flexible enough during the print process). It’s unclear exactly what the polymers are but the use of recycled wood could provide a substitute for some petroleum-based filament.
On the plastic filament side, there’s Filabot — a plastic upcycler designed to let a consumer turn their own household trash into plastic filament for using in their 3D printer. So the home 3D printer could conceivably help reduce general household waste by repurposing it and giving it a second life around the home — keeping it out of landfill in the process and generating a more virtuous circle/cycle of plastics usage.
There are also charitable efforts to encourage the manufacture of ethically produced, recycled plastic filament for use as standard in 3D printers — providing an income for plastic pickers in developing countries who remove existing plastic waste from the environment and process what is a negative environmental contaminant for positive utility in the 3D printing economy.
We’re going to need a whole lot more innovative projects like these coming up with creative ways to reuse, recycle, upcycle and reduce our reliance on plastics as 3D printers proliferate. The good news is that additive manufacturing allows for more flexibility in what we produce and how we produce it. So the opportunity is certainly there. Now we just need the ideas.
Over to you.

489,Sungevity Raises $70M To Expand Its Solar Business Globally,https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/04/sungevity-raises-70m-to-expand-its-solar-business-globally/,2014/04/04,"
Sungevity, an integrator and marketer of solar installation services, has raised $70 million in new financing as it looks to expand internationally.
The round was led by Jetstream Ventures, a Nashville-based investor focused on companies that have an environmental and social benefits. Other investors included the Germany utility E.On, and GE Ventures, who previously invested in the company’s $125 million equity and debt funding in July 2013.
Oakland, Calif.-based Sungevity doubled its U.S. sales in 2013 and is expanding in the Netherlands and Australia, where it launched services in 2011 and 2012, respectively.
“As new, more customer-centric solutions around residential solar arise, we want to provide our customers with the best solutions available,” said Susana Quintana-Plaza, vice president of technology and innovation/strategic co-investment at E.On. “Our capital investment in Sungevity’s technology and customer-centric platform is a significant part of this.”
The company sells solar design and integration services to consumers in nine states and the District of Columbia, and is the exclusive partner to the home repair and furnishing retailer Lowe’s.
“We are the hub, if you will, for several partners in different areas of the industry,” said John Ordona, vice president of marketing at Sungevity. “We are the hub for equipment partners in terms of panels and modules and installers and also financing partners. We are the face to the consumer.”
The company’s financial partners include US Bank, Citibank, and SunRun, according to chief executive Andrew Birch.
Investors and corporations have warmed to solar installers over the past few years; despite its recent woes SolarCity is up from its initial public offering, and utilities are making moves to acquire their own solar installers.
“The fundamentals of solar have been improving over the last five to 10 years,” said Birch. “That’s going to continue.”
In January 2013, the company raised $125 million in venture capital and project financing from investors, including Energy Capital Partners, Brightpath Capital Partners, Lowe’s Cos., alongside Craton Equity Partners, Vision Ridge Partners and Eastern Sun Capital Partners.

Environmental watchdog agency Greenpeace is looking at the ecological performance of the world’s leading Internet companies once again, and this latest report finds that Apple, Facebook and Google are doing the most to lead the charge towards a sustainably powered Internet, while Amazon, and specifically AWS, is dragging everybody down.
AWS is one of the world’s leading distributed hosting providers, but it doesn’t reveal any details about its energy footprint to either its customers or the public in general, which is what has it running afoul of Greenpeace’s rankings. In addition to being the least transparent company on the report, it uses only 15 percent clean energy sources according the organization’s own investigations, and Greenpeace says it continues to slide relative to its competitors on energy performance.
The top performers get much more of their energy from clean sources, rather than bad ones like coal and nuclear that earn Greenpeace’s censure. Apple uses 100 percent clean energy sources, according to Greenpeace, to power both iTunes and iCloud. Part of that comes from its solar station, which is the largest privately owned one in the U.S., and is responsible for keeping its North Carolina data center humming along. Facebook uses half clean energy sources, and is investing in renewable energy initiatives to power its North Carolina and Iowa data centers, which serve itself as well as Instagram. Google also uses a good chunk of clean energy, powering about 34 percent of its web-based properties (including Gmail, YouTube, and Google Play) from clean sources.
What’s next? Greenpeace calls for all major web companies to make a commitment to becoming 100 percent renewably powered, and to become transparent in respect to their energy sources. Finally, they’d like the Internet giants to figure out a clear strategy for leaning more heavily on renewable energy sources.

491,"Tesla Pays Telefonica Millions To Power In-Car Wireless In UK, Germany, Spain, Holland",https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/01/tesla-pays-telefonica-millions-to-power-in-car-wireless-in-uk-germany-spain-holland/,2014/04/01,"
Those with a sharp eye who visited the Geneva motor show or who own a Model S in Europe may have already noticed a connection between Telefonica and Tesla by way of the “car connected by Telefonica” signs on the sides of cars, or through the in-car navigation system that played Spanish ads. Now the two are making it official: Telefonica says that it will be providing the wireless connectivity for Tesla cars across the UK, Germany, Netherlands and Spain, covering telematics and infotainment services.
This is not the first carrier deal for Tesla in Europe; in November 2013 it announced a deal with Telia Sonera for the carrier to power in-car systems in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Estonia and Latvia.
But Telefonica tells me it is likely the biggest in terms of geographical footprint and customers: Tesla paid Telefonica “millions” to seal the deal, a spokesperson tells me.
It follows another, similar carrier deal Tesla inked with AT&T in January of this year.
In terms of how it will work for users, it is not unlike Amazon’s Kindle service: users get a wireless connection as part of their purchase of the item (in this case a car), without having to sign a separate contract for that connection. The service is powered by Jasper and will provide the Internet connectivity for various in-car “infotainment” and telematics, including navigation, streamed music, Internet browsing and remote vehicle diagnostics.
For Telefonica, a deal with an aspirational brand that epitomizes forward-thinking innovation is a big win at a time when it continues to try to position itself not as a stuffy old carrier, but a forward-thinking technology company in its own right. It comes at a challenging time, about a month after Telefonica scrapped a standalone division called Telefonica Digital, reintegrating those services back into the main company.
“As we accelerate our transformation into a digital telco we see lots of opportunities to empower consumers,” Jose Luis Gamo, CEO at Telefonica Multinational Solutions, said in a statement. “Connected cars that provide drivers with more information and a better and safer driving experience is a perfect example of this. Tesla is one of the world’s most forward thinking and exciting businesses. We share their passion for innovation and are thrilled to be working with them to deliver a superb connected in-car experience to Tesla drivers across Europe.”
Connected cars are still a relatively small part of the bigger automotive picture — and Tesla even more niche — but their numbers are only growing at the moment. Telefonica estimates that connected cars account for 10 percent of all cars on the market, but that number will grow to 90 percent by 2020.

In what seems to be the beginning of a real-life Wall-E situation, Philips has introduced an even easier way to control your home’s Hue smart lighting system. Because, you know, fishing your smartphone out of your pocket when you want to switch the lights will probably exhaust you to the point of hospitalization.
Lazy factor aside, the Philips Hue Tap is actually a clever little gadget. It is a $59.95 device that sits in your home, on a table or what have you, and lets you control the lighting of your room with a tap. Even more impressive, the Hue Tap doesn’t need to be plugged in. It draws zero watts, and instead uses kinetic energy from your tapping to power itself. This little accessory will be on sale in North America and Europe with Philips retail partners starting after this summer.
Of course, to use the Hue Tap at all you need the Hue Bridge, as well as a few Hue lightbulbs. The starter kit goes for around $200 at Apple.
This slideshow requires JavaScript.
However, you also have the option to purchase a Hue Bridge, the brains of the operation, and get cheaper, LED lights that were also announced this morning. They’re called Hue Lux LED bulbs, and they come with all the same smart controls as the regular Hue lights except the clever color functionality. That means you can use a Jawbone UP to trigger turning them on in the morning, among other neat tricks via third-party apps. They’ll go on sale with the Hue Tap later this year.

Philips was an early entrant in the smart lighting space, which is now being crowded by other appliance manufacturers like Samsung and LG. However, Philips has a product that is established and reliable, and gives you the option to add a splash of color to your life. Plus, many have already invested in their starter kits, so it makes sense to stick with the same brand.
If you want to get down to brass tacks, the Hue Lux is $39.95, while the new Samsung bulb announced yesterday that does basically the same thing hasn’t been priced, but should be somewhere between that and the $32 LG charges for its own smart bulb, also announced earlier this week. Something tells me these consumer electronics makers knew roughly each other’s plans in terms of the rough timing of these launches. These new bulbs with more limited functionality are much more affordable than the existing Hue bulbs, which cost $60 a piece, making it expensive to outfit a whole home.
Finally, Philips is also introducing the Hue Luminaries line, which is a series of 3D-printed Hue table and hanging lights that will be pricey, Europe-exclusive and more works of art than home appliance. Fancy stuff, but maybe this signals that you’ll be able to 3D print your own Hue-compatible lamps at home in the future, rather than depending on exclusive, high-end and high price designer models.

What more could you want?
Oh, right… A tapper to turn those colorful lights on and off, because you’re so lazy.

493,Blue River Technology Takes In Another $10M For Its Agriculture Optimizing Robots,https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/19/blue-river-technology-series-a-1/,2014/03/19,"
Blue River Technology, which uses robotics and computer vision to optimize agriculture by, for instance, determining which lettuces to thin out of a row and which to keep, has closed a $10 million Series A-1 funding round, led by Data Collective Venture Capital — topping up a $3.1 million Series A it raised back in 2012.
Eric Schmidt’s Innovation Endeavors also joined the round as a new investor, while existing investor Khosla Ventures participated.
Blue River Technology’s main premise is to reduce the use of chemicals in food production by optimizing agricultural methods via robotics systems that can automatically recognize plants and make decisions about which seedlings to thin or identify weeds to eliminate.
The idea is to enable large-scale farms to tend to the  needs of individual plants vs the broadcast methods employed by current generation agriculture — which relies on spraying pesticide en masse, because, well, chemicals are dirt cheap. Yet problems with environmental or even food contamination are not factored in to current farming methods, and that’s something Blue River is hoping to change.
CEO and co-founder, Jorge Heraud, told TechCrunch: “Traditional agriculture is very chemical intensive. Chemicals are broadcast applied — a field of many acres, many hectares, gets the same treatment. All plants get fertilized in the same way, all plants get treated with chemical herbicide whether they have weeds or not. Or they get pesticides whether they are sick or not. Everything is just treated the same way.
“The future I see is a future where we use half, a fifth, a tenth of those chemicals by just understanding and putting herbicides only on the plants that need them, by putting fertilization only in the quantities that you need them, putting disease control chemical only on the plants that need it. This can means just a phenomenal amount of savings and efficiency increase and yield increase… We’re calling it ‘making every plant count’.”
Blue River Technology’s first product — currently being used by some eight customers in different parts of the U.S. (and bringing in revenue for the startup) — is designed to precision thin lettuce crops by allowing farmers to set the required spacing between plants. The machine then targets herbicide spray to remove only the plants that aren’t wanted.
Typically this work would usually be done by human thinners — so in this instance Blue River Technology isn’t necessarily reducing chemicals used. But that’s part of its strategy to overcoming the agricultural industry’s over-reliance on herbicides and pesticides generally.
Heraud said the biggest barrier to uptake of robotics optimized agriculture is the low cost (to agriculture) of using chemicals. That’s why it’s started by focusing on specific areas where costs are higher — such as the aforementioned lettuce thinning (being as it’s usually done by human workers who are more expensive to employ than mass spraying).
By targeting its tech at areas that aren’t currently optimised by automation, Blue River hopes to expand into areas that are — and help reduce the chemical load being sprayed onto fields in the process.
“If you’re competing against chemicals right now, or big pieces of automation, it’s pretty hard; the costs are pretty low,” said Heraud. Ergo, the initial strategy to build traction in the agricultural industry is “getting good at the bits where chemicals are not being effective yet”.
Other areas Blue River hopes to target next are portions of agriculture where herbicides have been over-used and led to problems with herbicide-resistant weeds — which in turn requires farmers to use more expensive chemicals to kill them. That makes a precision targeting technological solution potentially more attractive, argues Heraud.
Blue River plans to use its new financing to further expand its engineering team and product offering. Specifically, he said it’s working on improving its lettuce precision thinning machine with a next-gen version of the product in the works that’s wider, faster and more accurate.   
It’s also working on extending its plant recognition systems — which is where the computer vision tech comes in — and also on big data techniques for application with row crops such as corn and soybeans, which it said can benefit from phenotyping for crop breeding as well as precise weed control.
Phenotyping refers to the process that seed breeders engage in in propagating plants to produce high quality seed. This is an area where Blue River sees plenty of potential for its technology.
“What this machine would do is look at plants and take very quantitative measurements of how the plant does in different situations — how does it respond to having low nitrogen, how does it respond to having low water, how does it respond to higher temperatures, higher salinity  — so the idea is to understand the plant’s physiology better, so you can select better, so it’s a research tool for seed developers,” said Heraud, explaining how Blue River’s computer vision tech could be applied to the phenotyping field.
“It’s a very important tool too — if you think about agriculture and how you can have an impact on agriculture… the work that seed breeders do can have one of the largest impacts on food and food worldwide,” he added.
Commenting on Blue River’s funding in a statement, Vinod Khosla said: “Blue River is taking a very innovative and practical approach to solving one of the world’s top problems – how to produce more food in a responsible way. I’m impressed by how quickly the company brought its first product to market, and how successful it’s been. This high-caliber Blue River team has assembled leading experts spanning both cutting-edge technology and agriculture, and they are in a great position to lead the next gen of environmentally-friendly precision agriculture.”
“Blue River is leveraging three important trends: machine learning, data-driven agriculture and robotics,” added Matt Ocko, founding partner of Data Collective Venture Capital, in a second supporting statement. “This approach has the potential to revolutionize how we produce food in the near future.”

494,"The Mass Market Tesla E Will Have A 200 Mile Range, Be Roughly 20% Smaller Than Tesla S",https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/02/the-mass-market-tesla-e-will-have-a-200-mile-range-be-roughly-20-smaller-than-tesla-s/,2014/03/02,"

A few new details about Tesla’s upcoming ‘affordable’ electronic vehicle came out of a talk the company’s founder and CEO Elon Musk gave last week, and Electrek has the key takeaways from the event. Musk shared info around what we can expect from the upcoming mass market ‘Model E’ from the electric car-maker, and those details suggest we’ll see a car with double the range and battery capacity of existing affordable electrics.
Musk said that the Model E will be about 20 percent smaller than the Model S, and that it’ll attain the same 200 mile range on a single charge. That led Electrek to the logical conclusion that the Model E’s battery will be around 80 percent the capacity of that found in the Model S, which amounts to around 48kWh. That’s still over double the 24kWh battery in the Nissan Leaf, which has an estimated range of 75 miles on a full charge.
The Model E should be priced at around $35,000 or half the entry-level cost of the Model S, thanks to economies of scale and improvements to battery production tech, which would indeed put it within striking distance for a mass market car buying audience. It would also make Tesla the market leader in an entirely new category when it comes to electric vehicles, which is good news for the car maker’s bottom line over the next decade or so.
Tesla recently announced that it would be building a battery “gigafactory” to help it drive down the costs of its battery packs by over 30 percent, which is designed in term to help it build ad scale production of its mass market vehicle, which it wants to bring to market within around three years’ time.

495,Changers Raises $1.5M To Turn Charging Your Phone Via The Sun Into An Infectious Game,https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/21/changers-raises-1-5m-to-turn-charging-your-phone-via-the-sun-into-an-infectious-game/,2014/02/21,"
Ever thought about what might happen if you got rewarded, not for a Foursquare check-in, but for generating electricity? Changers, a startup that allows people to turn the creation of solar power into a game that encourages green behaviour, has closed $1.5 million in Series A financing. German government-backed fund BFB Frühphasenfonds Brandenburg led the round, with participation from Heliocentris, a specialist in clean energy, alongside additional private investors.
The startup can now accelerate product, expand into the natural solar-rich markets of the Middle East and take advantage of consumers’ rising interest in energy, especialy in the wake of Google’s purchase of Nest.
Oliver Borrmann, CEO of BFP, says “We see huge potential for Changers as it combines rewards for energy-saving behavior with a proven community based on a gamified customer loyalty system.”
That’s basically code for a rather interesting new model: turning everyday green practices into the kind of game that not only rewards the consumer, but also allows solar producers to put more redundancy into the system.
Changers is known for the Changers System, a Social Energy Marketplace that enables people to produce their own energy, measure how much they produce, and convert it into a currency that can be used to buy sustainable goods and services from Changers’ commercial partners. The company markets the Changers Starter Kit, comprising a portable PV solar panel and a portable solar battery that measures how much energy it captures and stores.
It’s not been a gangbusters growth curve — only 5,000 kits in the last two years. However, that represents over 640 kWh and has saved over 6,000 kg of CO2.
But if you scale that up, the numbers start to look a lot more interesting.
And Changers has been through the wars to get there, pulling back from insolvency to get here. It has to be said that the fact that Changers is still around is a testament to the sheer grit and belief of co-founders Markus Schulz and Daniela Schiffer.

496,Brightup Is A Smart Home Lighting System That Works With Your Existing Bulbs And Lamps,https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/14/brightup-is-a-smart-home-lighting-system-that-works-with-your-existing-bulbs-and-lamps/,2014/02/14,"

Smart home lighting is a growing field, with entrants including Philips and LIFX, but one other new contender has a different approach that might appeal more to some. The Brightup system consists of plug socket hardware and in-wall dimmers, connected to and controlled by a central hub via Z-Wave RF tech, to provide remote dimming and intelligent behavior/programming to any and all lighting systems in your house.
The Brightup offers remote control of your lights, but that’s just the beginning. It also has geofencing so that lights can be set to turn on or off when you enter or leave the house; there’s an ambient light detector that can tell when you turn on the TV to automatically dim your lights for improved viewing conditions; the same ambient light sensor detects fading natural light and can tell when the sun comes up in the morning to control light levels. Random scheduling will simulate being home even when you’re away, and you can use lights to let you know a timer has gone off, which is handy for cooking, for instance.

The system’s components are nicely designed, and the project creators say you shouldn’t need outside help for installation. Brightup also measures and records energy usage, and provides remote access that you can share with family members and friends. The in-wall modules look a little more complex in terms of installation, but they should work in your existing receptacles behind the light switches you already have according to Brightup, which means no new holes required.
The Hamburg-based company is looking to raise €130,000 ($178,000 U.S.) on Indiegogo over the next 46 days to build Brightup, with starter packs including a central unit and three in-wall or socket connectors for €199 ($272 U.S.). The cost is considerable; A Philips Hue starter set runs $199 and includes three bulbs plus the central control hub, but Brightup works with lighting other than what comes in the package, and Hue is really an entirely different kind of product.
As the connected home and home automation space gets more crowded, it’s interesting to see the different approaches companies are taking to solve essentially the same problems. Brightup’s system has plenty of merit, but it’s competing with some heavy hitters already in the mainstream market including Belkin’s WeMo line. With Z-Wave and an open API, it does seem one of the more extensible and future-proof options out there, however, so that may play a role in getting customers on board.

497,Apple’s 2014 Supplier Responsibility Report Earns Greenpeace Praise On Conflict Materials,https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/13/apples-2014-supplier-responsibility-support-earns-greenpeace-praise-on-conflict-materials/,2014/02/13,"Apple has released its annual Supplier Responsibility report, detailing its monitoring of supply partner labor practices, compliance with regulations and Apple’s standards of business, the environmental impact of its product components and more. Apple highlighted its ongoing education investments in the report, detailing the growth in its worker rights and skills training up top.

Other highlights from Apple’s report include a new program that extends Apple’s monitoring of worker rights to intern students provided by vocational schools that Apple works with; 95 percent compliance on average with its 60 hour work week program; 451 audits of the supply chain overall conducted in 2013, which is many more than the 298 conducted in 2012; and more transparency about which suppliers and facilities provide its raw metals and materials, including lists of which have been verified as conflict free and which are still in need of future verification.
That last effort has caught the attention and earned the praise of environmental watchdog and activist agency Greenpeace. The organization provided TechCrunch with the following statement regarding its appraisal of Apple’s newest report, from Greenpeace Energy Campaigner Tom Dowdall:
Apple’s increased transparency about its suppliers is becoming a hallmark of Tim Cook’s leadership at the company. Apple has flexed its muscles in the past to push suppliers to remove hazardous substances from products and provide more renewable energy for data centers, and it is proving the same model can work to reduce the use of conflict minerals.  Samsung and other consumer electronics companies should follow Apple’s example and map its suppliers, so the industry can exert its collective influence to build devices that are better for people and the planet.
That’s high praise from the group, and a sign that Apple is indeed doing things right when it comes to sourcing the basic elements involved in making the parts for its products. The name-and-shame tactic will put pressure on suppliers to improve their practices, and make it so that competitors who don’t follow their lead will look like they’re shirking their duties by comparison. Apple took a step in this direction last year by joining the Public Private Alliance on Responsible Minerals Trade, and it’s nice to see them progressing their efforts even further.

498,Primus Power Gets A $20M Jolt For Grid-Scale Energy Storage,https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/04/primus-power-gets-a-20m-jolt-for-grid-scale-energy-storage/,2014/02/04,"
New regulations in California are set to open up the market for large-scale energy storage and battery technology developer Primus Power has just raised charge into the fray. The Hayward, Calif.-based battery startup has raised $20 million for a new round from strategic investor Anglo American Platinum through its Platinum Group Metals Development Fund.
Previous investors Chrysalix Energy Venture Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, I2BF, and DBL Investors have committed another $15 million to the company over two previous rounds of funding.
Primus’ new investment comes as other battery companies tackling large-scale energy storage for utilities have stumbled. Xtreme Power, a Lyle, Texas-based company raised $48.5 million from venture investors before declaring bankruptcy earlier this year. A123 Systems, which was also attempting to develop grid-scale energy storage technologies in addition to manufacturing lithium-ion batteries for cars and power tools, was bought out of bankruptcy by the Chinese manufacturer Wanxiang Group in January 2013.
For South Africa-based resource developer, Anglo American Platinum, the investment in Primus is an attempt to juice consumption of its platinum ores – almost like an Intel investment in computers and software to drive chip consumption. The fund is also an investor in Canadian fuel cell manufacturer Ballard Power.
In addition to its venture capital commitments, Primus has also raised $20 million in government grants to tackle the grid-scale energy storage problem. These problems are caused by the intermittence of renewable energy coming online. Solar and wind power are not constant and grid scale storage is one way to ensure that power generated by these alternative energy sources is not wasted.
Globally the market for grid storage is expected to grow more than 30% over the next six years, according to a study by Navigant consulting cited by Primus Power. By 2020 the consulting firm expects the market for big batteries to reach the big sticker price of $21.9 billion. California, with its mandate for 1.3 gigawatts of energy storage coming online by 2020 is leading the charge.
Big markets like this bring out big competitors and massive industrial conglomerates like General Electric, the Japanese company NGK Insulators, and smaller companies like ZBB Energy are all developing new large-scale energy storage products.
What differentiates Primus from other batteries is its design. Unlike other flow batteries Primus’ batteries don’t have a membrane. The company uses a metal electrode which has twice the cost but can handle ten times the power density of other batteries, according to Tom Stepien, Primus Power’s chief executive officer.
“Our [batteries] can handle ten times the density, even at twice the cost we win on a factor of five,” he said. “The [other] difference is we have a single flow loop – other batteries have two tanks, two sets of pipes and two sets of pumps – the single flow leads us to a lower cost.”
Primus already will be shipping its first energy storage systems to a military base in Southern California later this year and is installing another set of energy storage devices at an existing sub-station run by Puget Sound Energy outside of Seattle.
For Kleiner Perkins the investment in Primus Power represents the firm’s third battery deal in two months. Battery companies in Kleiner’s portfolio including Aquion Energy and Amprius have raised a cool $100 million since January.
“There were a few rough years in cleantech,” said Nancy Pfund of DBL Investors – a backer of cleantech darlings Tesla Motors and SolarCity. “When you weed out the poor players there’s a huge opportunity that remains and we think the industry is just getting started.”

499,Dropbox Is Spilling Over To A Humongous Second SF Office,https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/03/dropbox-office-333-brannan/,2014/02/03,"
Dropbox is growing so fast it will soon run out of room at its San Francisco headquarters. That’s why it’s just signed a 12-year lease on a second office a 10-minute walk away at 333 Brannan to house spillover of its 500 employees, sources close to the company tell me. Kilroy Realty put out a press release bragging about leasing the space to Dropbox earlier today.
Back in 2012, Dropbox moved from an 11,000 square foot Mid-Market office into its current spot at 185 Berry St in the China Basin area of San Francisco’s South Park district. Originally that office was 87,000 square feet, but then Dropbox expanded to more of the building to occupy a total of 200,000 square feet.
When I visited the single-floor 185 Berry location a few years ago, it was practically empty. Dropbox had less than half the number of employees needed to fill it. With so much ground to cover, employees would often ride scooters and skateboard-like Ripsticks over its polished cement floors. There were lines of unfurnished meeting rooms, and a whole wing of the office was completely uninhabited.
But when I went by for its latest enterprise press event in December, it was already starting to feel claustrophobic. With so many people walking around, wheeled-locomotion had become too dangerous to attempt. Every area was crammed full of desks as well as LED art, a jam room for musical instruments, and sculptures of its AK-47-toting velociraptor mascot (that I just had to take a selfie with). Dropbox said it added over 300 employees to the company in 2013, and it showed.
Then last month, Dropbox raised $250 million (with another $150 million possibly in the works), giving it a total of $500 million with which to fuel expansion into the enterprise. Selling to Fortune 500 companies requires a big sales force that likely wouldn’t fit in its current digs.
Sales could be one department housed in the new 333 Brannan location. However, sources close to the company say Dropbox hasn’t decided exactly what part or parts of the team will be booted from the headquarters into its nearby annex.

Dropbox will control all 187,000 square feet of the William McDonough-designed office still under construction at 333 Brannan. It’s a six-story brick and concrete building with the open floor plans preferred by startups, plus a rooftop garden and deck. It will feature a rainwater reclamation system that could cut water usage by 45 percent and energy usage by 26 percent. The location is about a 15-minute walk from BART and a 10-minute walk from Caltrain for employees commuting via public transportation.
Keeping its offices in the city might give Dropbox better luck in some areas of recruiting. Many tech giants choose to build massive campuses in the South Bay then run controversial shuttle buses back and forth from San Francisco so employees can live in the city. But Dropbox’s youthful company culture likely attracts people with little interest of living in social dead-zones like Mountain View and Menlo Park where Google and Facebook have their plots. This way, energetic Dropboxers can live and work in SF (if they’re willing to pay the rent).
By nearly doubling its total office space, Dropbox should have room to house at least another year or two of swift growth. And plenty of dinosaurs.

A new Kickstarter project debuting today offers a lower barrier of entry to those interested in testing the smart lighting waters. At just $25 for an entry-level pre-order of a single unit, the LuMini is the cheapest way to get started with a smart home lighting system, albeit with some trade-offs compared to category leaders like the Philips Hue.
The LuMini comes from TABU Design, a Hong Kong shop that makes the Lumen Bluetooth smart bulb. The full-size Lumen is fairly large, though, and has a 40-watt equivalent output all for $69. The LuMini has the lower retail cost, but it’s also less powerful: TABU Design says it’s ideal for a “night lamp,” but doesn’t specify how many lumens it actually outputs. It uses 3 watts, compared to 7 watts for the standard-sized Lumen, so you can expect it to be probably around half as bright.
With a companion app, you can control the light color, brightness and scheduling, but the difference from most other connected lighting systems with the LuMini is the Bluetooth connectivity: It uses the low-power standard introduced in Bluetooth 4.0 to connect, which greatly simplifies the connection and setup process, but which also has some disadvantages in terms of range (20 ft. maximum) and the ability to remotely connect to your lighting system, which allows you to control bulbs like the Hue from anywhere with connectivity.

The BLE approach still allows for things like proximity activation, however, and it can even be set to trigger light-based notifications for incoming calls. The real innovation here is on price, however, since this is a long-lived LED bulb (rated at 30,000 hours) that will retail for around $30. Also, it’s a very small bulb, whereas others like the LIFX smartbulb have been criticized for their larger-than-normal size.
The TABU Design team hopes to ship the LuMini in April this year, which isn’t that much of a stretch when you consider that they’re already actively shipping the original Lumen, which is sold via its website and through Amazon. The project is seeking $50,000 in 30 days, and hopefully it gets there, because what this market really needs is more price pressure to drive mass market adoption.

501,Practically Green Raises $3M To Help Companies Manage Sustainability Programs,https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/30/practically-green-series-a/,2014/01/30,"
Practically Green says it has raised $3 million in Series A funding for its online tools that encourage employees to act more sustainably.
The company launched with a product dedicated to consumer sustainability, but it has since shifted its focus to powering similar programs for customers like NBC Universal, eBay, MGM Resorts, and Unilever. Founder and CEO Susan Hunt Stevens told me that 90 percent of those programs are “employee-facing,” but companies can use Practically Green’s technology to create their own consumer sustainability programs, too.
When setting up their programs, customers identify the areas of sustainability that are most important to them. Environmental sustainability is the obvious one, but the company says it also includes things like family and fitness. Then they can choose the actions that they want to encourage (“from riding your bike to work to eating more healthy”) or create actions of their own, which are then encouraged and tracked through a variety of company channels including mobile apps, intranet, and email.
Other features include recommended products, explanations on “Why This Matters” and “Your Impact” to motivate employees, and information on who at a given organization has already accomplished a given goal.
Stevens said there are sound business reasons for embracing these programs. First, there are the cost savings from activities like using less energy. (She said some customers are seeing savings of as much as $100 per participant.) Second, it helps companies attract employees who want to work for sustainable organizations. And finally, some businesses see sustainability “as key to innovation and competitive advantage.”
The funding comes from CommonAngels (a network of Boston angel investors), Pan-Asia, LaunchPad Venture Group, and Clean Energy Venture Group. Stevens said she was particularly pleased to be bringing top software investors and top cleantech investors into the round, because she believes Practically Green sits at the intersection of both industries.
The company is also announcing that it has hired Mark Bissell, an early employee at SuccessFactors, to be its head of customer success.

502,Facebook Saved Over A Billion Dollars By Building Open Sourced Servers,https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/28/facebook-open-compute/,2014/01/28,"
Facebook is reaping the benefits of designing its own energy efficient servers. Today at the Open Compute Summit, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that “In the last three years alone, Facebook has saved more than a billion dollars in building out our infrastructure using Open Compute designs.”
Facebook started the Open Compute Project back in April 2011 and it’s since blossomed into an industry-spanning coalition of companies that open source green technology designs for servers, data centers, and more. It includes Intel, AMD, Bloomberg, Box, Cumulus Networks, IBM, and Microsoft.
While the Open Compute Project has saved the world a lot of energy, it’s also cut back on energy Facebook would have had to pay for. Zuckerberg proudly told interviewer Tim O’Reilly on stage at the Summit that “In just the last year we’ve saved the equivalent amount of energy of 40,000 homes in a year, and saved the amount of emissions equivalent to taking 50,000 cars off the road for a year.”
Considering that recently the average US houshold used 903 kilowatt hours per month at an average price of $0.1209 per kilowatt hour, that means Facebook could have saved somewhere in the ballpark of $52 million in energy thanks to Open Compute designs.
Facebook’s VP of Engineering Jay Paraikh also noted that over the past three years, Open Compute designs have let Facebook save $1.2 billion.
Along with helping the environment, the project lets Facebook crowdsource improvements to its infrastructure and allows multiple vendors to produce identical equipment that gives Facebook supply chain diversity. The whole thing is probably a great engineer recruiting tool too.
From a high-level, Open Compute fits nicely with Internet.org — a project designed to make basic Internet devices and data connections affordable to five billion people still disconnected. Together they illuminate Facebook’s recent modus operandi: figuring out ways to help the world that also save it money or expand its empire.

503,Apple Patents A Two-Sided Solar-Powered MacBook Screen With Touch Input,https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/28/apple-patents-a-two-sided-solar-powered-macbook-screen-with-touch-input/,2014/01/28,"
A new patent granted to Apple today (via AppleInsider) introduces a concept that shows how it might go about introducing touch-based input to its notebook line. The patent describes a special notebook display that has two sides, as well as photovoltaic cells for charging, and touch input sensors on its outward shell.
The design is quite different from anything Apple currently puts out, and has an almost sci-fi style top surface that features glass which can be triggered via electrical sensor to appear either solid and opaque or transparent. Solar charging cells are built into the surface so that when it’s transparent it can use ambient light to charge the notebook’s battery. There are also provisions for either an embedded Apple logo to be included beneath the glass surface, a small secondary LCD display or a series of touch sensors.
The secondary display could thus be optionally hidden away from view entirely when not in use. And it sounds like the secondary display could provide vital information when needed, or at-a-glance access to notifications and updates even when the device is closed or in sleep mode.
Touch sensors on the shell could trigger mechanical lock or software locks, according to the patent, as well as allow a user to input pass codes, or control media playback on the device. Other types of input could be accommodated as needed, according to the patent, so you can imagine it serving as supplementary for a number of applications, or as a potential trackpad replacement if the laptop is being used in closed mode with an external monitor.
The patent was originally filed in 2010, so this may be relegated to the R&D labs, but it would make for a very interesting and novel Apple notebook design. The solar-powered element alone would do wonders for all-day usability and possibly alleviate space requirements for batteries within the case, so it could be an area of continued study for Apple engineers.

504,Google Invests $75M In 182MW Texas Wind Farm,https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/14/google-invests-75m-in-182mw-texas-wind-farm/,2014/01/14,"
Google just loves its green energy investments and today, the company announced a $75 million investment into the Panhandle 2 wind farm outside of Amarillo, Texas. This marks the  company’s fifteenth renewable energy investment and its second in Texas.
Once it’s operational, the new wind farm is scheduled to produce 182MW, enough capacity to provide energy to 56,000 homes. The facility is schedule to go online by the end of 2014 and will consist of 79 Siemens 2.3MW turbines. Morgan Stanley has provided financing for the project and Pattern Energy, as well as three tax equity investors will acquire the facility once the construction is completed.
At $75 million, this is not exactly Google’s largest investment in renewable energy yet. That honor belongs to Solar City, which received $280 million from Google to provide financing for residential solar projects. In total, Google says, it has now invested in enough projects to generate over 2GW.
Google’s biggest cleantech investment to date, though, is clearly Nest, which it acquired for $3.2 billion yesterday. There is no direct connection between the two announcements, but Google has obviously had a very strong interest in energy-related projects for a while and this only increased once Larry Page became the company’s CEO again in 2011. With Nest in its portfolio, we may see the company shift a bit more from large-scale energy projects to more consumer-oriented hardware products that help its users save energy directly.

Nest is now rolling out a 4.0.1 upgrade to its smart thermostat after last month’s faulty 4.0 firmware caused Wi-Fi and battery issues. Update 1/7/14: Nest tells me the 4.0 bugs are not responsible for turning people’s heat off or down in the dead of winter, but that Nest hardware issues are sometimes to blame. Other causes include incompatible furnaces and people forgetting to change their air filters.]
This in part explains what’s going on if if you check out Nest’s Facebook wall or run a Twitter search on it.



@nest Coldest night in Iowa in years, and I wake up at 4 AM with the temp. dropped to 54 degrees, and the Nest is cycling on/off constantly.
— Richard Harms (@richharms) January 6, 2014



Customers like Clayton and Richard (seen above) have been flocking to social media to report Nest problems ranging from annoyance to disaster. Some say they’ve come home or woken up in the middle of the night to a freezing cold house. When they investigate their Nest, they find it turning on and off repeatedly, or suddenly out of battery. In some cases it’s shut off or down their heat. One unlucky customer had his pipes freeze because his house got so cold.

One user wrote to TechCrunch explaining his Nest issues in detail:

“At about 4PM Friday, our heat shut off without warning. On inspection, the Nest unit appeared to be stuck in an endless loop of power cycling.  Each time it powered on, it would display the spinning blue loading indicator, and then a message would appear, instructing that we detach the Nest from the mount and reattach it. After being reattached, the unit displayed a message indicating that it was restarting, and the process would repeat indefinitely.
We followed the online troubleshooting guide with no success. We then tried to call support, but were met with impressively-long wait-times and a message acknowledging the existence of a breaking software change that seems to have been pushed out just as the bulk of the country was starting to rely on their furnaces.”


[Update 1/7/14:
Originally after speaking to Nest, I got the impression that the company felt that incompatibility, clogged air filters, and other problems beyond its control were solely responsible for people losing heat. That’s why I published with the headline “Nest Says Shut-Off Heat Not Its Fault, But Pushes Thermostat Update To Fix 4.0 Problems”. But after speaking to a representative today, the company clarified that in some cases Nest inaccurately tells customers they don’t need a common wire to power their Nest thermostat when they do. The lack of a needed common wire can cause Nest to malfunction and shut off or lower a home’s heat. Some users have mistakenly blamed this issue on the faulty 4.0 update when in fact it’s unrelated. It’s good to see Nest now being more clear about taking responsibility for issues that seriously affect customers.]
While there are plenty of happy customers who’ve had no problems, others are angry Nest didn’t proactively notify users about the 4.0 bugs. Instead, last month Nest posted to its support center about “Intermittent low battery or connectivity issues with thermostat software 4.0”. There it says:
“We have discovered a bug in our latest 4.0 thermostat software that affects a small percentage of our users…affected users will see a low battery warning on the thermostat, see their thermostat as “OFFLINE” intermittently in the app, and won’t be able to control them using the Nest app….As of Sunday, Dec. 8th, we have a short-term solution and have started updating affected thermostats. We’re rolling these thermostats back to version 3.5.3, which should fix the problem.”
Unfortunately, some people rolled back to 3.5.3 are experiencing a new set of issues. Exacerbated by lots of new users installing Nest products they received for Christmas, customers contacting support are enduring extremely long wait times. Those who do get help on the phone or over email are given long sets of instructions to troubleshoot their own devices.
Affected customers are demanding Nest do more thorough testing of its updates before pushing them out, or at least provide a way to turn off automatic updates. In the meantime, some are switching back to their old, cheap analog thermostats.
But today, I spoke with Nest co-founder Matt Rogers who says the 4.0.1 update is ready and is now being rolled out. He also denied that Nest issues shut off people’s heat. In a statement, the company explains:

“As stated in the support center message, the 4.0 update caused a small percentage of customers to lose Wi-Fi connectivity and therefore the ability to control the temperature remotely. Their heating and cooling remains unaffected except for remote control.  We’ve rolled many of those customers back to 3.5.3 to resolve Wi-Fi connectivity while we work on the fix. In the coming days, we expect to release version 4.0.1, which has the same Wi-Fi performance as 3.5.3 with all the great features of version 4.0.
Regarding the small percentage of customers who experience drained batteries, we work with users who contact our Support team on a case-by-case basis because there are many variables that can cause this – including homes with clogged air filters, or with old or unusual HVAC wiring. Sometimes the fix is to run a power wire, other times the customer’s system is incompatible with Nest. To clarify, this is not related to the 4.0 update. “

It seems anyone with problems or considering buying a Nest should be sure to change their air filters and ensure their furnace is compatible.
Still, Nest will need to better educate customers and ramp up support to avoid being blamed for problems it didn’t cause. Otherwise, customer issues like these could shake confidence in Nest right as Re/code reports it’s trying to raise $150 million to $200 million at a $2 billion to $3 billion valuation. Fortune’s Dan Primack says this round “remains very much a work in progress.”
That work could get a lot harder if investors worry Nest is souring opinions of some of its earliest adopters, even if it’s not responsible for problems. Because accurate or not, people’s opinions on social media influence their friends’ buying habits.
Every product has its vocal minority of jilted users and we can’t verify that all the issues customers are reporting are entirely Nest’s fault. But there seems to be a critical mass of discontent right now. For what it’s worth, though, Rogers sounded legitimately saddened about the 4.0 problems distressing customers, and told me “We do take these things really seriously, even if it’s not our fault.  We’ll answer support calls and we’re always there to help people when they have issues.”
As we move toward having more of our lives managed by high-tech devices, their creators will need to double down on stability and security. Unlike work or entertainment gadgets, devices like Nest’s thermostats and smoke detectors are vital pieces of home infrastructure. Software bugs don’t just cause inconveniences, but real quality-of-life and safety issues. “Move fast and break things” just doesn’t work when you’re involved in our survival.

506,"Meet Kubo, The Crowdfunded Electric Cargo Scooter Made By Lit Motors",https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/10/lit-motors-kubo-electric-cargo-scooter/,2013/12/10," 

Lit Motors, the electric car startup that launched last year with its first vehicle called the C1, has debuted another sleek looking electricity-fueled vehicle called the Kubo.
The Kubo is a uniquely designed vehicle that brings together the best of both worlds from scooters and cars: It has a small two-wheeled form factor, but a nice amount of storage space. Lit describes it as “combining the beautiful design of Apple and Vespa with the basic utility of a pickup truck.” I’d liken it to a modern two-wheeled version of the El Camino, only much more beautifully designed (and eco-friendly!) Either way, it’s a very nifty piece of work. Once you see it, you wonder why something like it hasn’t been made already.

Lit Motors is hoping to crowdfund the initial production of the Kubo through a Kickstarter campaign launched last month. So far, the company has a ways to go — a little over $45,000 has been pledged out of the $300,000 goal, so with nine days left in the campaign the clock is certainly ticking. As sleek as the Kubo is, it might have been a bit ambitious to expect dozens of people to each put down $5,000 to reserve a yet-to-be-built scooter from a small startup.
But whatever happens with this particular Kickstarter campaign, Lit’s chief marketing officer Ryan James tells me that the company will figure out a way to get the Kubo into production for all the people who want it. There are lots of people rooting for Lit, and it will be exciting to see how its designs are made into a reality (and eventually come to our roads.)
We swung by Lit Motors HQ to get a first-person look at the Kubo and watch Lit’s CMO Ryan James take it for a spin. Check it out in the video embedded above.

507,Rentals Delivered By Drone Could Make Ownership Obsolete,https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/02/nirvana-brought-to-you-by-robots/,2013/12/02,"
Why buy something when you could rent it, have it instantly delivered when you need it, and taken away when you’re done? While Amazon’s unveiling of its Prime Air drone-powered delivery service could make buying easier, it’s drone pick-up that could make it so we don’t need to buy things at all.
The sharing economy holds the promise of a more efficient, collaborative way of living. Startups like Airbnb and GetAround are thriving by making use of our empty apartments and parked cars. It’s proving feasible for humans to share housing and transportation, but we haven’t quite figured out the sharing of most objects. Perhaps the biggest hurdle is delivery and pickup.
A few startups like Neighborgoods have tried and failed to let you rent things from other normal people. Need a stud finder or hot glue gun? Don’t buy one and rarely use it. Instead, search in your town for someone who has what you need and rent it. Problem is, who wants to drive across town and back twice to scoop up a rental and drop it off when they’re done? Factor in the travel time plus gas and it might be easier/cheaper to just buy the object.
But drones.

Unlocking The Sharing Economy Of Things
Amazon last night showed off its experimental Amazon Prime Air unmanned aerial vehicles that could one day deliver what you buy from its e-commerce site. The hope is that within five years, Amazon Prime Air’s autonomous drones could deliver items weighing up to 5 pounds (84 percent of what Amazon ships) within 30 minutes to the right locations.
Caveats abound. As Quartz notes, it could be a long-time, perhaps 2020, until the FAA determines drone delivery is safe enough and the red tape is navigated to permit it. The Hill reports that lawmakers want better drone privacy rules.  Even then, the Washington Post explains that drones might need human pilots that could kill their cost-effectiveness for deliveries/pick-ups.

Sure, there’s plenty to poo-poo. But it’s hard not to imagine that robots will eventually alter the landscape of how goods move about.
While he’s normally focused on filesharing and identity, Facebook Director Of Product Management Sam Lessin has been thinking for a while (and even did a Tedx talk) about how robots will enable the “end of ownership.” He believes Uber, Google’s self-driving cars, and Amazon Prime Air are all pushing us in the same direction — a world where we buy less and share or rent more.
This morning Lessin wrote that Amazon Prime Air “is actually all about the backhaul. It will be cool when drones can deliver something to you in 30 min… it will be much much cooler when the drone can pick it back up when you are done with it. Drones (and self driving cars) are the key to the ‘sharing’ economy.”
He’s right. Today, the most convenient way to have access to something you want is to own it and keep it where you live. That’s because the process of having something delivered is too costly, cumbersome, and slow to do every time you need it.
Luckily we’re seeing delivery times get shorter at a dizzying pace. Until recently, a few days to a few weeks was the quickest you could get something brought to your door. Then Amazon’s shipping empire enabled affordable and reliable two-day and next-day delivery. Now there’s a slew of companies, including Walmart, Google and eBay, vying to offer same-day delivery where you order something in the morning and get it by night.
Still, people don’t want things soon. They want them NOW. A 30-minute Amazon Prime Air is the closest approximation of “now” we’ve seen yet. It’s one reason Amazon’s little drone video is a viral hit today (a savvy way to show Amazon is an innovative company to love or work for, as well as keep the e-commerce service top of mind on Cyber Monday).

Yet the greatest impact of robotic delivery might not be owning things quicker, but rather not having to own them in the first place. That’s because once you can have something approximately now, the functional difference between ownership and rental disappears.
What if rather than buying with Amazon Prime Air, you rented? Jeff Bezos’ drones could pick up your item when you’re done with it and bring it back to the warehouse, or even directly to another customer.
Imagine if this means that, rather than buying something for $100, you might only use once or twice, you could rent it for $25 each time you needed it. You could save money with minimal additional inconvenience. You’d already have to wait for the initial delivery if you bought it, so the only price you pay for your discount is the 30-minute wait times on subsequent deliveries.
Perhaps drones aren’t the answer. There are plenty of obstacles to their commercial use. Maybe we’ll 3D print what we currently buy. And there will always be things too big to be conveniently shlepped around. But eventually, I’d bet it won’t be humans delivering the pizzas, tools, electronics, clothes, and many other things we buy or borrow today.
Rental Nirvana
If the shift is heralded by centralized companies like Amazon, we might see trucks full of drones deployed to more remote areas. The drones could fan out to do their deliveries and pickups, and return to the truck to be brought back to the warehouse.
The end of ownership could also be fueled by a decentralized peer-to-peer model. Maybe you buy things you use relatively frequently, but keep them in a storage unit just outside of town and rent them out via drones when you don’t need them. That means your house or apartment could be smaller because you’d have fewer unused things to store.
Either way, as Lessin wrote on Quora earlier this year, storage/shipping/drone launch pad real estate near big cities could become more valuable to Amazon and everyone. And while there are plenty of issues with airborne drones, similar value could be offered by road-based self-driving cars. Google and Uber could one day team up to start carry objects instead of just people.
Though it could take decades, the repercussions of this shift away from ownership are numerous.
We might buy less stuff and all objects would spend more of their existence being used rather than in a closet, so we wouldn’t have to manufacture as many copies of things. That could put lots of people out of work. No, there aren’t enough drone repairman jobs to make up for all those lost on the assembly line and delivery chain.
On the brighter side, what happens to the savings we score from rental over ownership? Sure, we might pocket it. But we could also rent higher-quality versions of the cheap things we would have bought, or rent things we never would have gotten to use at all.
Perhaps most exciting of all is what the transition from owning to sharing could mean for our psyches. Maybe a rental economy wasn’t what the Buddha intended when he said we must cast off material possessions to achieve nirvana. But the sharing economy could make status less about the things we own, and more about what we do with them.

We’ve seen fire harnessed to power a phone charger for the great outdoors, with the nifty FlameStower, now meet Hydrobee: another Kickstarter project aiming to provide an off-grid alternative for charging a battery you can then use to juice your phone. But, as its name suggests, Hydrobee is all about water.
There’s two parts to Hydrobee. When wearing its ‘Stream Body’, the gizmo can be placed in a river or dragged behind a boat — so long as the water is flowing faster than 1.8m/s (or 4mph+) — and two to four hours later its battery will be fully charged.
A smaller inner unit can also be attached directly to a flowing faucet to charge — so could be used as a back-up power generator for your phone during a power outage (so long as your taps don’t require electricity to pump the water to them).
Once Hydrobee’s battery is juiced, you can then plug in a USB device to charge it — a secondary charging process that presumably takes several more hours.
Hydrobee reminds me of a CDT project I worked on in school, where we stuck a dynamo on a paddle wheel-bearing rig designed to float in a river and stuck a micro bulb on top that we hoped would be powered by it… Long story short it didn’t work on demo day, but that’s technology demos for you.
Hydrobee has clearly perfected the hydroelectric tech better than a bunch of schoolkids managed to. The prototype consists of a tiny hydropowered turbine sited in a can with rechargeable batteries and waterproofed electronics, and a USB 2.0 port — so you can juice up your phone or other USB-powered device.
The internal batteries are 6 x 1.2V AA NiMH rechargeable cells of 2,500 mAh capacity, yielding a total of 15,000 mAh.
It is still a prototype for now. And Hydrobee’s U.S.-based creator has put a call out for Kickstarter users to give him feedback on the sorts of things they’d like to be able to use the device for to help shape the final product. The campaign is looking to raise $48,000 in crowdfunding, with 17 days left to run. If it hits its funding target, Hydrobees will be shipped to backers next March.
The Hydrobee turbine generator, which can be used to generate a charge from water from a running faucet or hose, is being offered to early Kickstarter backers for $24. Or it’s $78 for all the kit, including the floating Stream Body.

509,"Tesla Shares Drop On Smaller Than Predicted Loss, Company Cites Production Constraints",https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/06/tesla-shares-drop-on-smaller-than-predicted-loss-company-cites-production-constraints/,2013/11/06,"
Tesla’s share price is higher than makes any logical sense, given the number of cars it makes and sells, but the stock value got a little bit of a real-world correction last night after hours as the car-maker’s quarterly results showed another quarterly loss – albeit one that still beat Wall Street analyst consensus. Tesla reported a loss of $38 million on total revenue of $431 million for the quarter, and its share price was down just over 10 percent in pre-market trading this morning.
The losses were attributed to mostly positive causes by Tesla, however, if there can be said to be a positive reason for coming up short millions of dollars. Tesla cited its ongoing research and development spend regarding retail stores for selling Tesla vehicles, as well as for building battery stations that will pepper the globe with its Supercharger means of powering the Tesla S and other electric vehicles built by the automotive startup. And the R&D budget is getting bigger, not smaller, with plans to increase its development budget by 25 percent for the fourth quarter as it works to build the Model X sport utility and make improvements to the Model S.
Tesla chairman and CEO Elon Musk also pointed out during a conference call to discuss the results that the company is “production constrained, not demand-constrained,” which means that it’s still raking in plenty of sales. It delivered a new record of 5,500 Model S cars during the quarter, and was limited only in terms of how many automobiles it could roll off the assembly line.
For Tesla, there’s a dual challenge of delivering vehicles and building out a proper infrastructure to support them. Expanding across the globe isn’t just a case of opening a regional sales office and dealing with local regulators, though there is that, too; the company also has to make sure there’s a charging network in place adequate to the needs of its target market of drivers in each new geography. That means analyzing exactly where it needs to deploy Supercharger stations to make it so that drivers are covered for the trips they want to take, and then actually rolling out those locations, which means signing up partner sites to let them take over some parking spots and install chargers.
Tesla’s next stop is Europe, after having opened the West Coast Supercharger network spanning the U.S. from San Diego to Vancouver in Canada last week. Europe growth of the Supercharger network is planned throughout 2014, so while production increases may help secure more revenue from car sales, don’t expect R&D spend to decrease in future quarters.

510,"Apple’s Tim Cook Is Right, Anti-Gay Policies Hurt The Economy",https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/04/apples-tim-cook-is-right-anti-gay-policies-hurt-the-economy/,2013/11/04,"
The elusive CEO of the richest company in the world, Apple’s Tim Cook, has taken a rare step into the spotlight to urge Congress to ban sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace.
In a Wall Street Journal OpEd, Cook argues that passing the Employment Nondiscrimination Act is not only a moral imperative, but sound economic policy:
“Those who have suffered discrimination have paid the greatest price for this lack of legal protection. But ultimately we all pay a price. If our coworkers cannot be themselves in the workplace, they certainly cannot be their best selves. When that happens, we undermine people’s potential and deny ourselves and our society the full benefits of those individuals’ talents.”
I’m no fan of bigotry, but is Cook, who is widely thought to be gay himself, right that discrimination hurts the economy? In short, yes, but it’s hard to determine the impact.
A UCLA Law review of research finds that anti-discrimination policies make for healthier, more cooperative, and committed workers [PDF]. IBM-sponsored ethnographic research finds that gay workers who feel accepted in the workplace are also more willing to share creative ideas [PDF]. “If I’m not out at work, I spend more time trying to conceal my home life and therefore not concentrating on my job.” explained one respondent.
To some extent, we’re lucky to live in a country where our economy isn’t held hostage to Congress’s inability to promote equality. Nearly every major company in America supports gay workers and knows they’d face crippling public backlash on top of missing out on top-notch talent by discriminating. The companies most in charge of innovation won’t be impacted by legislation.
Still, every sick, disparaged, and fearful worker hurts the economy. Innovation comes from unexpected places: every fired teacher and bullied teenager makes it that much less likely innovative Americans will ever reach their potential.
One of the godfathers of modern computing, Alan Turing, died shortly after the British government forced him into chemical castration for being gay. Turing’s revolutionary mathematical theorems proved how computers could be more than simple calculators. He died at the young age of 41 directly from discriminatory legislation. Who knows what he could have contributed to computing in the later years of his life?

511,"Tesla Officially Opens West Coast Supercharger Circuit, Covering San Diego To Vancouver",https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/30/tesla-officially-opens-west-coast-supercharger-circuit-covering-san-diego-to-vancouver/,2013/10/30,"
Tesla’s West Coast Supercharger Corridor opened today, making it possible for owners of the Model S to travel free between San Diego and Vancouver, using Highway 101 and Interstate 5. This makes a Supercharger reachable within 200 miles to over 99 percent of Californians and 87 percent of those in Oregon and Washington.
A lot of attention has been paid to Tesla’s efforts to make a coast-to-coast trip in one of its vehicles a reality, via Superchargers and other charging stations, but blanketing the West Coast means that Tesla S owners can now travel from essentially the Mexican border to within the Canadian one without paying any money to fill their cars, and with a minimal amount of charging time required. Superchargers can charge a Tesla S to a capacity worth around 200 miles of driving distance in just 30 minutes, and the stations are positioned near restaurants and shopping centers to give you something to do while your car powers up.
To promote the new corridor, Tesla is having two Model S vehicles make the trip from San Diego to Vancouver, and they’ll be pushing updates to their various social media properties along the way. Spoiler alert: those cars are definitely going to make it without incident.
Supercharger rollout continues globally, with Tesla announcing plans in September to cover 100 percent of the population of Switzerland, Belgium, Austria, Denmark and Luxembourg, and 90 percent of the population in England, Wales, and Sweden with a station within 320 kms by the end of 2014. Getting past that basic excuse of “I can’t buy one, there’s nowhere to charge” is clearly a huge part of the company’s global rollout strategy, which is why each of these Supercharger network expansions is a big win for Tesla and for founder Elon Musk.

512,Update: The Spring Shuts Down Its App For Funding Social Good And Earning Cash Back By Dining Out,https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/29/the-spring/,2013/10/29,"
[Update 1/13/2014: The Spring is shutting down. The startup says it has run out of money, didn’t see enough traction, was threatened with a trademark infringement suit, didn’t expect to be able to raise more cash, and it leader founder is burned out…amongst other problems. You can read co-founder Brent Schulkin’s detailed post-mortem blog post here.
As I wrote in The Spring’s launch story below, failure to gain traction and sign up businesses were two of its biggest threats, and ultimately they did derail the company. Even with a solid social mission and value proposition to users, it’s an extraordinarily crowded competitive landscape out there. Another issue is that as more restaurants signed up for The Spring, the new customer discovery and loyalty benefit it provides them is splintered — a reverse network effect.
To build the marketing and sales team to make The Spring succeed like Yelp or OpenTable in the local business space, it would take a lot of money. Investors simply weren’t willing to gamble on it with so many challenges to face. You can read our unedited launch story on The Spring below.]
The Spring lets you save the world without doing anything. You connect your credit card to The Spring, pay with it at local restaurants, and automatically trigger donations to needy neighborhood causes while also earning yourself cash back. There are no check-ins or pay-up-front coupons. Just eat at great local restaurants like you normally would and you make a positive impact in your community.
The Spring launches today in San Francisco at a dozen restaurants, including local favorites Dosa and Gracias Madre, and has plans to expand to other cities eventually. Its iOS app and site have a Yelp-like guide for finding participating restaurants, and it even pulls in Yelp reviews to help you discover top eateries.
The Spring is totally free, so there’s little reason not to sign up and punch in your credit card info. Even if you forget about it, you might happen to eat at a Spring-equipped spot and do some good accidentally. That might mean funding a soup kitchen, an education garden at an inner city school, or technology training at the local women’s center.
Do Good, Pay Less
Here how founder Brent Schulkin describes The Spring:
“The story is, you’re Josh. You live in San Francisco’s Mission District. You love your neighborhood, and love the idea of supporting it. But in reality, you don’t really do much volunteering or donate to every little thing. Although those are your values, you want to do something that’s easy. You’re busy and don’t want to be inconvenienced. I’m the same way. Most people are. And we can all use The Spring.”
When you pay your normally priced bill with your Spring-connected credit card at a partnered restaurant, 3 percent goes to local causes, 3 percent goes back to you which you can cash out through PayPal, and 3 percent goes to The Spring to expand the service so it can fund more causes. You get an email thanking you for triggering the donation, with info about the project you funded, and sharing buttons to tell friends how they can help.
A Loyalty App With Heart
Why would a restaurant pay 9 percent of their revenue to be part of The Spring? Because the donations create an emotional connection between the customer and the business. The Spring incentivizes people to try out an eatery, to keep coming back, and to tell their friends. It will take time to prove, but the theory is that a windfall of customers will handily make up for the 9 percent.
It’s simple for businesses to sign up, too. There’s no hardware, iPads, or clumsy point-of-sale systems to integrate or train employees on. As long as they use a reasonably modern credit card system, everything happens quietly in the background after the check is paid thanks to The Spring’s payment processing partner.
Even with this value proposition, The Spring will still have a tough time gaining traction. There are plenty of restaurant finders, loyalty apps, and ways to donate money. Mogl gets you more cash back, but doesn’t help anyone but you. eGood gives 10 percent to causes, but requires cumbersome tablet use at checkout and doesn’t get you any discount. Then there’s Belly, Flip, Pirq…but The Spring hopes its combination of social good and rewards will win out.
Another issue will be trying to convince Bay Area restaurants to come aboard — businesses that are constantly hammered by startups trying to “help.” It only has 13 signed up right now, so that will have to grow. Luckily The Spring has a former head of sales from Groupon leading its on-boarding charge, and this time he has something positive to push.
Frictionless Activism
Schulkin’s been looking for a better way to make a difference for 10 years. He led protests in college but saw no effect, then started Carrotmob to harness collective buying power to push local businesses to give back. But Carrotmob was too complicated, so he raised money from some angels and worked with eco-design studio Greenstart to make social good as simple as possible.
Out flowed The Spring. You do good and feel good while actually paying less for food. Schulkin concludes, “This is a total no-brainer. Why wouldn’t you sign up?”

513,"Book The Cheapest, Easiest Eurotrip With Wanderio",https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/28/book-cheap-europe-travel-wanderio/,2013/10/28," 



Twenty-two sites. That’s the average number a traveller visits before booking a big trip. But Wanderio wants to be your one and only. The Italian startup lets you enter any two addresses worldwide, and it shows the cheapest, most convenient combination of planes, trains, and automobiles to get you door-to-door. Today Wanderio comes out of private beta and launches publicly at TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin.  
Booking travel can induce decision paralysis. With so many permutations of ways to get from place to place, it can be tough to finalize plans with confidence. Is this the cheapest way? With the shortest total travel time? With the fewest transfers?

Wanderio’s co-founder Disheng Qiu felt this pain himself. He was living in Rome while his girlfriend lived in Amsterdam. He longed to see her…without going bankrupt or spending his life on the move.
There were sites comparing flights like Hipmunk, or for booking trains, or for finding taxis and shuttles, but none that brought them all together. In Europe especially, flights can be cheap, but ground transport is expensive, and with multiple airports in major cities, the distance from touchdown to final destination can vary widely.
Lisheng needed Wanderio, so the star developer and computer science PhD began building it with his co-founders CEO Matteo Colò, a management Masters, and CTO Luca Rossi, another CS PhD. The 8-person team has impressively bootstrapped the company for two years so far, but is now looking to close a round of about €150,000.
Wanderio launched its private beta in June, but today opens the service to everyone. It works worldwide, but has the deepest options indexed for European travel.

The Wanderio interface will be familiar to anyone who’s used Hipmunk or Kayak, but rather than entering your start and end city or airport, you can enter exact addresses. Wanderio crunches all the travel combos and shows you the best routes as easy-to-understand visual timelines. Each leg of the journey is color-coded and displays the travel time and price. It’s built web first, but has a tablet-optimized mobile site with plans for native apps
Wanderio also lets you filter results by price, duration, or even CO2 emissions for the eco-conscious. You pick a route, then lock in each leg’s specifics. When you’re ready to book, Wanderio sends you to the airline, train, and taxi/shuttle sites to pay. That last part is a bit of a hassle, but the team eventually hopes to strike integrations with its partners so you can buy tickets straight from Wanderio.

The startup earns money from referral fees. On flights it’s just a tiny 1%, for trains it’s 5% to 7%, but on ground transportation it can be as high as 10% or 15%.
Helping people book their taxis, shuttles, and limos to and from the airport or train station will be Wanderio’s cash cow. “Those are services without much exposure on the Internet” so they’re willing to pay high referral fees, Wanderio CTO Luca Rossi tells me. Long-term, Wanderio is interested in finding people accommodations and events to go to on their trip, from museums to concerts.
But in the meantime, it will have to survive competition from Waymate, GoEuro, and more. Wanderio hopes to win by focusing on the door-to-door experience including ground connections, but so does fellow journey planner RouteRank. There are also new startups like Vamo from former Facebooker Ari Steinberg to contend with. Wanderio doesn’t have a strong viral loop right now. That could make it growth tough, along with ample competition,
They’re all in it for the same reason, though. Wanderio‘s Rossi proclaims, “Travel is one of the best experiences in people’s lives. It connects people, makes you interact with other cultures. We’re helping people have a more pleasant experience as a whole. Technology can do all the work on their behalf. You should enjoy your travel and that’s it.”

Wanderio presented today in the TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin 2013 Battlefield. Here’s a recap of its Q&A with the judges:
It’s obvious how to get from one big city to another, and people rarely need to travel between distant small villages. Why is this necessary?  If you don’t have an effective way to compare the services, you end up paying much more, even if you think your route is obvious.
Competitor GoEuro has raised a lot of money. How are you different?  We have a different focus on transfers. We’re working on repository of this data. We currently have 20,000 transfer services offered. We get you from door to door.
Do you need to do the flight search at all? Or can you just be a way to compare how to get back and forth from the airport?  “We’re addressing the pain of travel” and it wouldn’t make sense to make people go to another site to compare flights.

514,"Innovation Can’t Fix Partisanship, So Silicon Valley Doesn’t Fight The Shutdown",https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/08/innovation-cant-fix-partisanship-so-silicon-valley-doesnt-fight-the-shutdown/,2013/10/08,"
Silicon Valley’s deep-pocketed lobbyists and outspoken netizens are conspicuously absent from the debate over a government shutdown that could cripple the U.S. economy. Activists from the tech industry fight for immigrants, startups, gay rights, voter turnout, scientific funding, education, presidential hopefuls and national disaster victims. So, why not get involved in the shutdown fight? Because, the U.S. Congress is a train wreck and there are no innovative solutions to partisanship.
The very nature of Congress is a two-player, zero-sum game. There’s little incentive for both parties to work collaboratively on novel ideas, since it could potentially help the other side win more seats. Moreover, members of the House of Representatives have methodically carved out hyper-partisan districts that re-elect incumbents more than 80 percent of the time.
There are radical system-wide changes that could make Congress as collaborative as some western European governments (“consensus democracies“). But, barring a complete overhaul, the government will continue to descend into increased partisanship and poor productivity.
Activists from the Silicon Valley area tend to get all politically hot and bothered under two conditions: policy impacts innovation and there’s a novel technical solution.
For instance, Silicon Valley lobbyists were largely absent from the surveillance-happy cyber security bill, the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA). CISPA threatened the Fourth Amendment, but not innovation, so there was little uproar.
In areas where clever hackers can come up with an innovative idea, Silicon Valley folks rush to center stage. Google’s Eric Schmidt helped Obama think about his digital strategy, Change.org rallied tech people for gay marriage with online petitions. Wikipedia blacked out its site over piracy legislation and Google created maps to help natural-disaster victims. All of these ideas worked splendidly.
But, there are no innovative solutions to partisanship, because it’s the system itself that’s the problem. And, as Lydia Depillis from the Washington Post found, since angel investors aren’t impacted by short-term economic shocks, shuttering the government for a few weeks doesn’t raise any hairs.
Moreover, even the most powerful Silicon Valley players aren’t terribly good at lobbying without the force of a novel technical solution, especially against House Republicans. Mark Zuckerberg has personally made the rounds in D.C. to advance his pet political project of comprehensive immigration reform, but the issue hasn’t progressed an inch. Silicon Valley has a poor track record (recently) of influencing nationally salient legislation through brute-force lobbying alone.
Techies like to use their brains. But the shutdown is a shouting match; Silicon Valley has nothing to add.

A brand new app called Goldee launches today, offering Phlips Hue users a new way to use their connected lighting system. The app provides dynamic “light scenes” which use artist-sourced photos as their palette, changing tones gradually to provide dynamic shifts in color, including gradual on/off sequences for waking up in the morning or going to sleep at night.
There are 10 different scenes included in the app at launch, each which a brief description and credits (citing the scene’s creator, the photographer of the source image and the location where it was taken). Tapping on any starts the dynamic lighting, with each bulb attached to your Philips Hue system taking part. You can specific if you have multiple rooms in a single home with Hue bulbs, too, and run a different scene for each. The first light scene also has an alarm feature, and the last one has a sleep timer for going to bed.
The app works well, but there are some caveats – you have to have the app running in the foreground to get the dynamic effect to work, and the screensaver built-in to keep your display from using too much juice is a little finicky when it comes to returning your display to full brightness once you activate the screen again. But on the whole, it’s a unique experience, and one that Hue owners are likely to appreciate.
“The Goldee team started innovating home lighting even before Philips hue was introduced,” Goldee CEO Tomas Baran explained in an interview. “We figured out right away that Philips hue is a very good tool to build upon [with lighting]. However, the Goldee App is only our first step towards changing how we perceive and interact with light.”
Baran says that there are plans in place to do “something much bigger,” which he expects to reveal more about later this year. He calls light “a new form of art,” hence sourcing its scenes from people with experience in that field, and notes that light is never static in nature. I asked whether this might be a bit narrow in terms of focus for a whole company, but Baran says Goldee is betting we’re just seeing the beginning of change in this space.
“Every new thing is risky in the beginning, but if we wait until it becomes popular it will already be too late,” he said. “We believe a revolution has started in the lighting sector with smart LEDs. We have no doubt this will be the future. We used to watch black-and-white TVs, nowadays we cannot imagine a display without colors. Obviously, it will take time, but we see the same thing happening with light. ”
The app is free, and so far the only content that’s locked within the app can be made available via either rating the app or sharing via Twitter and Facebook. There is a “library” section that promises to add additional light scenes in future, and some of those may arrive as paid upgrades. For now, Goldee is a well-executed curiosity, but it’ll be interesting to see if smart lights really do herald the kinds of changes Baran envisions.

516,Varentec Raises $8M From Bill Gates And Khosla To Reinvent Industrial And Utility Power Grid Management,https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/30/varentec-raises-8m-from-bill-gates-and-khosla-to-reinvent-industrial-and-utility-power-grid-management/,2013/09/30,"
San Jose-based Varentec, a company that builds power management and monitoring solutions for the electric grid, today announced the close of an $8 million Series B round of funding from Bill Gates and Khosla Ventures. The new funding follows its $7.7 million Series A, which was led by Khosla, and previously secured funding from the U.S. government. Varentec is about to start rollout of its energy monitoring and analytics solution for global electric utility companies and other industrial customers, and the funds will help it do that.
What Varentec hopes to accomplish understandably takes considerable funding juice; its aim involves updated outdated legacy systems that are in place at many of the world’s industrial sites, and which are intimidating projects to take on for utilities both private and public. Varentec has spent the past couple of years piloting its so-called “Edge of Network Grid Optimization with investor-owned utilities, including two in the U.S. and one in Mexico, and is now ready to roll things out on a production scale.
The means through which Varentec offers additional efficiency is by allowing utilities to install devices on the points in their system that are giving them the most problems – rather than requiring they install sensors and smart meters at every point throughout their network (hence “Edge of Network”). These devices use a line-based sensor that can actually alter voltage at that spot, with analytics and data gathering tools that make up the rest of Varentec’s secret sauce. These independently operating modules work better than remote sensors tied to a central command hub because they can respond immediately to problems and fluctuations.
Varentec’s founding team, which consists of Dr. Deepak Divan, Andrew Dillon and Mehrdad Hamadani haven’t been able to just convince some of the smartest investors on the planet of the value of their idea; they’ve landed a couple of grants for the U.S. government that total over $7 million, in addition to their venture funding.
Smart grid technology isn’t necessarily the flashiest thing around, but it is an opportunity with lots of potential upside in terms of ecological and economic benefits for some of the biggest and most stable businesses in the world. Initiating change in utilities is probably the biggest barrier to success, but Varentec now has a good amount of money in the bank to help it continue to build momentum thanks to this new investment.

517,"Causes Relaunches As A Social Network For Social Good Action, Not Shallow Clicktivism",https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/24/causes-social-network/,2013/09/24,"
Click a link, click a petition, feel better without making a difference. That was the old Causes. Today, the new Causes launches to reactivate its 186 million registered million users. It’s an independent civic social network pushing education, donations, and pledged behavior changes, rather than a patchwork of campaigns tethered to Facebook. And it’s got a serious native advertising strategy.
“We believe there will be special purpose but deep social networks around specific parts of your identity” Causes CEO Matt Mahan tells me. “We think your purpose or civic identity is a core part that’s currently underserved.”
The plan continues to be serving up Causes as a for-profit business. It wants to make the world a better place, but by raising $16.4 million on the promise it will make money, it could hire better talent and more quickly scale its contribution to the world.

A Lot Of Bark, Not Enough Bite
The mission to connect people in support of common causes started back in 2007 when the startup was one of the launch partners for the Facebook platform. Founded by two former employees, Joe Green (now President of FWD.us) and Sean Parker (investor and serial entrepreneur) with a Series A from Founders Fund. Causes’ head start and the lucrative viral channels Facebook offered at the time let it quickly sign up droves of users.
The problem was they weren’t as getting much done as they could. In six years, the 186 million users did raise $48 million for non-profits and add 34 million signatures to petitions for grassroots campaigns, but much of their potential went unrealized.
Most people (me included) were delivered to Causes campaigns through Facebook Requests or wall posts their friends spammed them with, signed or gave a little money, and never came back. Few took the time to really understand what they were supporting. Save the whales? Sure. Click. Stop human trafficking? Here’s $10. Maybe I’ll see ya again in 17 months, Causes.
By this year, Causes had  60 employees and revenue in the millions thanks to display ads and sponsored campaigns, but had failed to become cash-flow positive and was still relying on its venture funding. It’s founders were no longer involved day to day. And its engagement had dwindled to just 6 million users per month — a measly 3% of its registered users.
Causes needed fresh blood, and found it by acquiring Votizen, another Sean Parker-backed company. Votizen converted people’s political vigor into influence, letting them encourage their like-minded friends to vote in elections. Its co-founder Jason Putorti was renowned for his classy, engaging designs. The deal was closed in January by Causes’ newly promoted CEO Matt Mahan. Him and Putorti set out to redefine Causes.
Turning Passion Into Action
Today their vision goes into production. The old Causes Facebook app will stick around for now, so veteran users don’t have to worry about their campaigns disappearing, but its the new Causes.com where things are really happening.
Already aboard are organizations such as World Wildlife Fund, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, and San Francisco Bicycle Coalition, as well as brands like Toyota and Kashi. Causes has also tapped celebrities with long track records of social good support including Forrest Gump’s Lt. Dan aka Gary Sinise who backs veterans campaigns, and wounded U.S. Congresswoman Gabby Giffords who fights for gun safety.
To start on Causes.com, you don’t have to login with Facebook anymore. It’s an “independent” social network that lets create a unique social graph around good, and sign up with just an email address. Then you pick a few digital “bumper stickers” that will represent your ideals on your Causes profile. Really, though, this is a lightweight way to get you to tell Causes what you’re into so it can suggest organizations and people for you to follow. It’s a savvy on-boarding flow that makes sure your feed is full of relevant projects.

That brings us to the homepage feed where you’ll see intelligent suggestions of campaigns to take part in based on what you follow. That includes making a donation, taking a pledge to do something like join an offline boycott, or watch the video for a brand-sponsored campaign which triggers a $1 donation from that brand.
While Causes would love its feed to be part of your daily routine, Mahan admits to me that “The way most people will get into a campaign is by seeing a piece of content syndicated through Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and email” or from a brand they’re connected to elsewhere. The goal is for Causes to proliferate horizontally instead of just top-down from organizers themselves.
That’s why Causes campaign pages are focused just as much on content contributed by supporters as by the admins. The top shows an official image, description, and call to action that explains how you can help, but the bottom is a feed of user generated content aiming to inspire and educate people about the project. In hopes of showing people their impact and encouraging contribution, each post displays the number of views and actions it’s driven.

To become a formal supporter who can invite friends and post to a campaigns feed, people actually have to take action on behalf of a cause. Mahan tells me “We want the notion of supporting to be heavier and more meaningful than Liking or following on Facebook and Twitter. It’s standing with people whose beliefs you back and you want to take action with. It should be the beginning of a relationship of collective action.”
The big new feature in the revamped Causes is the ability to create your own personal sub-page for any campaign. Here you can pledge to rally a certain number of actions, say $1000 in donations or 50 people confirming they’ll boycott a bad business. You can tell your own story about why an initiative is important to you, and invite friends. These personal pages turn anyone into a grassroots organizer.
Overall, the new Causes looks nice and could get a lot more done on behalf of social good movements than the old version. However, navigation feels a bit clunky and counter-intuitive, and it can be a bit confusing knowing if you should be adding content to a campaign or friend’s personal page. The core challenge for Causes will be making its new site either viral enough to stay top of mind via constant shares to other social networks, or changing people’s behavior so they stop by Causes naturally.
‘Good’ Advertising
If Causes can reactivate its tuned-out users and convince them to spend significant time on the site, it’s got a serious plan to earn money. Mahan explains “People are skeptical of advertising” but Causes can offer businesses a different way to connect. “We’re giving them a new, deep, rich way of building relationships with millions” say Mahan.
Instead of ads where click-throughs lead to a product page, Causes is building out native ad units in the form of sponsored campaigns. Rather than try to aggressively sell its beer, Budweiser can show people that it funds clean water projects. When people pledge support by watching a video informing them about why clean water is important, Budweiser gives a dollar on their behalf. It might have already planned to give that dollar, but by tying the donation to someone’s action, they feel like the beer company helped them make a difference, and their affinity for the brand grows.
Causes will be recommending these sponsored campaigns in the home feed, on topic pages, and in search. In some cases they’ll look like Facebook’s Sponsored Stories, where the ads highlight a friend connected to the brand’s campaign. For now on its desktop site Causes will also show more traditional display ads for social good organizations and campaigns, but Mahan tells me that native advertising is its focus going forward. That’s because these native units will fit well as users shift to mobile where there’s no room for old-school banners.
This business model also sets it apart from competing social good sites who make money in less scrupulous ways. “If you survey the space — Petitionsite, Change.org, Rally — they’re either taking a cut of donations or selling contacts, or doing both. We’ve decided to go with native ad units” says Mahan. That means when you sign a petition, your email address will never be sold to donation solicitors, and Causes uses Network For Good to process credit card payments at cost so as much money as possible goes to what you support. Still, it’s a crowded space with sites like Jumo, HopeMob, Google’s OneToday, and topic-specific sites vying for people’s pledges and donations.
In the end, Causes‘ idealism is its greatest strength, but also its greatest threat. Setting a barrier of action to joining a Cause ensures people really care about what they say they do, but it also creates a hurdle to sharing and growth. If it can consistently deliver relevant campaigns for us to care about, and refine its design to be more intuitive, the impetus will fall on us to make social good a part of our every day lives.

518,He’s Electric — Will A Revolutionary Black Box Turn Dale Vince Into Europe’s Elon Musk?,https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/14/hes-electric-will-a-revolutionary-black-box-turn-dale-vince-into-europes-elon-musk/,2013/09/14,"
Dale Vince sits in a spartan office in the corner of Ecotricity, one of the UK’s few green energy electricity networks, and taps away on an Apple Mac at his standing desk. The office is bare, other than a normal desk, a couple of chairs and a Union Jack flag hung on the wall. But the Union Jack is not sporting its normal Red White and Blue. This is a Union Jack fashioned in various shades of green. For Vince is a died-in-the-wool ecologist. While running his company, he blogs from a site called “Zero Carbonista” which has an image of him looking like Che Guevara. He considers the drive towards an electric future as important as Elon Musk, founder of the Tesla electric car company. Vince is deadly serious about being “green” and now his plans extend beyond wind turbines into a radical new technology he hopes to roll out across the UK and which he is only now talking about for the first time.
With his gleaming white teeth and tanned appearance Vince looks more like a well-preserved rock star. In fact he remains the sole shareholder in Ecotricity, Britain’s largest green energy company. He is regularly listed as one of the richest people in Britain. But the mainstream energy industry considers him a an upstart.
He’s unrepentant about his public image as a rebel. As he proudly says on his blog, “I’m a hippie, I run a business .. to bring change to the world. My interest is the next Industrial Revolution… how to live without burning up the planet.”
Born in 1961, Vince was the son of a haulage contractor, an experience which, perhaps, gave him a restlessness for the road. He “dropped out” at 15 and spent a decade as a new age traveller, eventually beginning a love affair with wind power after living on a hill, in an ex military vehicle, using a small wind turbine for power.
His alternative lifestyle led him to be of those to occupy RAF Molesworth to protest against the basing of US cruise missiles there and he was among the those at the so-called Battle of the Beanfield, near Stonehenge, in the mid-1980s. But it was his business building wind turbines to take to festivals such as Glastonbury so that people could power sound systems that led him to found Ecotricity.

Indeed, his passion for wind power generation eventually led him to attend the Kyoto conference in 1997, which produced to Kyoto Protocol recognizing global warming.
Today, he is best known in the UK for being an unrepentant champion of wind power against the countryside lobby who see wind turbines as despoiling the rolling hills of the English landscape. But in those wind turbines lies a significant – and unusual – business.
Ecotricity operates a not-for-dividend model – reinvesting income from customers’ bills directly into new sources of renewable energy. It claims to have invested almost £400 per customer per year for the past few years in building new sources of sustainable energy. This has been estimated to be as much as 10 times more that more than any other British energy company.
Vince’s first turbine went up in Stroud in 1996. Today, Ecotricity has over 70,000 customers and 55 turbines.
It has led Vince down some unusual paths. He backed the development of the Greenbird to smash the land speed record for a wind powered vehicle.

And he came to the rescue of his local semi-professional football club Forest Green Rovers when it hit financial difficulties. Today, he has re-made FGR FC as the UK’s “greenest football club” with ultra-low energy LED floodlights, an electric bus for away matches, electric cars for players and a pitch made of organic grass.
But Vince’s parallels with Elon Musk perhaps became clearer when in 2010 he developed an electric sports car, the Nemesis.
On first encountering Vince, you’d perhaps laugh at the Musk comparison. Unlike the latter’s clean shaven and designer-suited appearance, Vince dresses in jeans and a T-shirt, and occupies a paired-down, almost basic, office in Stroud, deep in the English countryside. Not for him a grandiose HQ, but a corner of the building staffed, mostly, by Ecotricity’s call centre operators.

But like Musk, Vince’s electric car project started with big ambitions. It cost £750,000 to develop, and had a top speed of 135 miles per hour. But what Vince quickly realized – as Elon Musk did – was that he would have to put in millions to even get close to selling electric cars.
Instead, he turned his attention back to creating a revolution in home power generation, home electricity storage, a new “green” mobile phone network and a radical way to generate electricity from the sea.
Today, despite his unassuming appearance, Vince speaks quietly, though confidently, about how he plans to introduce new technologies into the UK’s homes and how – if they take off – he may be able to enter new global markets with his radical approach, generated from a part of his company called EcoLabs.

Harnessing the power of the world’s wind is, in part, how he hopes do it. First, he plans to start with generating more wind power from urban homes.
Urban wind power has famously failed to make much of a mark on electricity generation. A fad for small, chimney-mounted turbines failed to take off when they were found to be almost useless in the mostly windless urban environments.
But Vince says the technology was “dismissed too soon” and approached in entirely the wrong way.
“The big wind turbines are pretty efficient now. But for small scale wind power there are not many solutions,” he says.
To address the problem, he has come up with a radical new approach: a small, vertical access, wind turbine he’s dubbed the “Urbine” – a name which came to Vince after a simple spelling mistake in an email.

“We decided to do it as there was a hardware gap. The small home turbines were not working. WindSave [an early UK urban turbine project which failed] was supposed to be good but it was a disaster, bad for the Wind industry and bad for anyone that bought one.”
Vince thinks that these small turbines could generate 6KWs of power from their positions on the tops of houses and be up to 40% more efficient than similar sized windmills on the market.
To achieve his aim, 12 months ago he recruited engineers to start producing an Ecotricity-branded, vertical axis urban turbine.
Vince says wind power experts tend to regard vertical axis turbines as being less efficient than a traditional horizontal one.
“There is a huge advantage in producing a turbine with a vertical axis” he says. “The mistake was in scaling down big turbines. A horizontal axis machine has to face the wind, but they tend to be in built up areas where wind behaves far more differently than on wind farm sites.”
In other words, a vertical turbine literally “doesn’t care” which direction the wind is coming from. Because of this, it doesn’t waste time having to turn to face in the right direction of the wind. It can turn more or less constantly, so long as there is wind.
The first prototypes are going through testing and accreditation and could be sold as early as next year direct to consumers or as part of an Ecotricity account – though that remains undecided. Certainly they could also be ideal for small businesses.
Indeed, Ecotricity has a 15KW version on the drawing board. According to Vince, this larger version could have an application in the offshore world, which could lead, he says, to a “huge reduction” in the size of the generator. And, he says, “if you can shrink the generator you can make a bigger, more efficient machine.”
SEA POWER
As well as aiming to revolutionize both urban and big-scale on-shore wind power with his super-efficient vertical axis turbines, Vince plans to take on the challenge of wave power.
Historically, generating electricity from Wave power has been harder and less efficient than many predicted when the idea was first floated. However, Vince and his team have some up with a radically simple approach, which could revolutionize the sector.
It’s called the C-Razor. This is a wave energy device Ecotricity plans to test in different locations around the UK before rolling it out commercially. But this is not a normal wave energy device.

The current thinking around generating electricity centers around wave power – effectively putting turbines into the water which move as the sea pushes against them. The problems with this approach are rife – electrical turbines and water do not mix, obviously.
Vince wants to employ a simper idea. “The C-Razor is basically a pump. It side-steps the fundamental challenge of underwater generation. Making electricity in the sea is very hard, and expensive. We address the problem by using the power of the waves to pump high pressure water onto the shore.” From there it becomes a simple issue of turning a turbine and generating electrical power.
In fact, Vince has plans to create what is effectively a sea water “battery” by pumping the water onto a cliff top tank, and opening the valve to the turbine when the wave power is low. This simply cuts out the intermittent periods when there is less generative power in the waves.
“This is the holy grail of the industry,” he says. “It’s sea energy on demand. We think this could have global ramifications if we can make energy at the right price. As it’s so brutally simple, we think the economics will be right.”
THE BACK BOX

However, the most interesting new idea to emerge from Ecotricity’s ‘skunk works’ that he calls EcoLabs is something Vince dubs a “UPS”, or Uninterruptible Power Supply. More simply, he calls it “The Black Box”.
This will be a kind of Internet-connected battery with inverters that could live inside an ordinary home — a sort of big black refrigerator.
“We could use it as an energy company to deal with the intermittency of the wind,” says Vince.
Tantalizingly, he says such as device could “change the shape of demand” and could insulate houses from peaks in demand.
“Its intelligent. It lets people live the way they live right now rather than having to change their behaviour. At the moment behaviour is a big barrier.” The ramifications of such a device could be pretty big, if his numbers are correct.
AS BIG AS NUCLEAR?
“By our calculations,” says Vince “if everyone in the UK had a Black Box we could reduce the load on existing electric power-stations by 15%”. Fascinatingly, this also happens to the the amount that existing nuclear power contributes to the UK electricity grid and represents the looming energy gap as older nuclear stations get taken offline.
If Vince’s Black Boxes took off, their impact could – he believes – mean that the current grid in the UK would have many more years of demand left in it, without the need to add more generation. As Steve Jobs used to say: Boom.
In the UK – indeed, around the world – there is a huge debate about whether to built new nuclear power stations to replace older versions. After the nuclear disaster in Japan, it’s become a debate which has concentrated the minds of many a politician.
It’s hard to say whether Vince’s numbers stack up, and will no doubt require independent assessment. But it is a fascinating vision.
After all, as Vince says, uranium is not an indigenous energy source in the UK, or indeed much of the world. But wind power plus a big battery in every home, could well be.
The first trials of the Ecotricity BlackBox will be later this year in the UK.
AN ELECTRIC CAR HIGHWAY

Following that thought, Vince’s quest for simplicity in the distribution of electricity has lead him towards a fiendishly simple solution to keep electric cars charged up and on the road.
Currently most charging stations for electric cars have been put in towns and cities. However, he points out, this is the last place they should be to address so-called “range anxiety.”
Instead, Ecotricty plans to create an “Electric Highway” – a series of charging stations for electric and plug-in hybrid cars placed where they are needed, in between the UK’s cities. And what’s more, they will be free.
Charging up at an Electric Highway outlet could charge a Nissan Leaf – one of the latest plug-in electric cars – to 80% full from a flat battery inside 20 minutes. Or the time is normally takes to fill up with gas, take a comfort break and grab a coffee on your average long distance journey.

In practice it’s likely to be quicker than that given that most car journeys are not long distance. In the UK for instance, 96% of car journeys are less than 100 miles. Most modern EVs – outside of the Telsa – have a range of about 100 miles because they are designed for city driving.
Vince says Nissan and Renault, increasingly seen as leaders in electric cars, are already involved in the Ecotricity project, which plans to roll out over the next year.
It’s at this point you start to realize Vince’s dabblings in an electrical super car all those years ago might not have been so crazy after all. Where Elon Musk has pursued his electric car dream, Vince has thought about some of the wider problems with current electric networks and power generation.
Indeed, he says it was the direct experience of creating an electric car that lead to his idea of an Electric Highway. “The question is, what’s halting the take-up of the availability of EVs and overcoming range anxiety? The charging points are not on the motorways – they are in the wrong places,” he points out.
That range anxiety, believes Vince, has meant that consumers have been misled about the performance of electric cars.
He believes that the Tesla S range of 300 miles, while relevant for the US, is “excessive” for most other countries, especially small European ones. “All it means is that you are lugging around a lot of weight in batteries that 96% of the time you are not using,” he says.
Warming to his subject, he points out that while “the Tesla spec sounds nice, you have to wonder about it given that companies like Renault are bringing out much cheaper models which are mass affordable EVs.
“Maybe the Tesla will simply become more like a Porsche? It’s the big, mainstream car makers that will change the market for EVs,” he says.
But urban turbines, sea power and a vast electric network are not all Vince has up his sleeve. He’s even now looking at creating a electric tractor.
Dabbling in side-projects aside, ultimately Vince is most excited about creating products which will delight his Ecotricity customers under his “green” brand, Ecotopia. With the launch of a new online customer self-service system he wants to create “a kind of eco-cloud of services” which will eventually publish the realtime output of its wind farms.

Indeed, in many ways it seems like Vince wants to surround his customers with eco products. A new mobile phone MVNO called EcoTalk – which would be linked to Ecotricity’s per generation services, and thus effectively wind-powered – is planned for later this year with a mobile network partner, as yet unnamed.
Is there nothing Vince is not working on? Perhaps even food?
“We want to take our brand into other areas of people’s lives. Some 80% of people’s personal carbon emissions come from spending their money on three things: energy, transport and food. We began in energy, we’ve moved into transport, and food is one of our next frontiers,” says Vince.
“Ecotopia is about people being able to do good with their shopping bills, EcoTalk is about doing good with your mobile phone bill. All of these things will be inter-connected.”
With this all-encompassing green vision of a company which reaches into lives with a single green power and technology brand, perhaps it’s easier to liken Ecotricity to Apple. Vince clearly wants to build an ecosystem of products locked into and around the Ecotricity eco-system.

519,Soil IQ Makes A Smart Probe For Your Garden,https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/10/soil-iq/,2013/09/10,"
Soil IQ is a company that’s bringing the “Internet of things” trend to urban and rural farming. 
They’re building a probe that streams soil fertility and weather data back to a paired app. Founded by a Princeton grad and soil scientist who has worked with hundreds of Kenyan farmers to increase crop yields, Soil IQ’s mission is to help people to grow food more sustainably. 
“The reality in this country is that most of our food is produced on factory farms,” said CEO Jason Aramburu. “They’re great for producing corn, soybeans and grains, but not so good for producing healthy food.”
In response, Soil IQ has built a wireless soil sensor for small gardens and farms to help regular people grow a healthier supply of fruits and vegetables. Their probe is powered by a solar panel so it can run indefinitely. They’re planning on retailing it for about $49 to both consumers and larger partners. 
Then, not only are they targeting U.S. consumers, the company has a dual mission. They’re also working with one of their investors, Orange Telecom, to help deploy these probes to farmers in East Africa. 
Aramburu previously started an organization called re:char where he worked with more than 1,300 Kenyan farmers to increase their yields. 

But now he says he’s trying to focus on food production for the 100 million households in the U.S. So he shifted into building Soil IQ. The probe can track and stream soil nutrient content, pH, temperature, moisture and light data. They’ve built an analytics platform that makes recommendations to home gardeners about how to optimize seed selection, fertilization and watering. 
It can work with either soil-based or hydroponics gardens and either food or medicinal crops. They’ve even rigged it to send SMS or Twitter alerts when plants need attention.
They also have a big ace in the pocket through a partnership with Yves Behar, the famed industrial designer behind FuseProject and chief creative officer behind Jawbone. He’ll help with fashioning Soil IQ’s app and product. 
The business model has a number of different angles. Not only is there the hardware revenue, Soil IQ could also license out their dataset, assuming enough people use it to produce interesting data on which crops grow well in different environments. If they also build up enough of a consumer base, they could also earn affiliate revenue from promoting other products like organic fertilizer or seeds. 
The company has raised about $200,000 from Orange and other angel investors.

520,"Elon Musk To Traverse The U.S. Using A Model S And Tesla Superchargers In 6 Day Trip, With Only 9 Hours Spent Charging",https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/05/elon-musk-cross-country-tesla-trip/,2013/09/05,"
The Tesla Model S is doing remarkably well, despite the challenges it still faces in terms of convincing average consumers that it can meet their everyday needs. One of the big remaining question marks around the Tesla S was how it would manage a cross-country roadtrip – that quintessential, if perhaps mostly fictional bastion of the American experience.
The Great Road Trip harkens back to an era of family RV excursions and camp outs, to a hippie youth spent thumbing rides from the highway shoulder, and to road trip movies in which the journey symbolizes the leaving behind of childish things. For Musk and for Tesla, it would mark a symbolic victory, one more blow against the naysayers who maintain that EV travel is inconvenient, impractical and even potentially impossible in some circumstances.
https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/375535096998006784
In the tweet above, you can see Musk proclaiming that he and his family will be the ones to secure this particular victory, with a six-day journey spanning 3,200 miles between Los Angeles and New York. During that time, the Musk clan will stop to “fuel” up exclusively at Tesla Supercharger stations (even though that’s not a required constraint) for only 9 hours in total, with 1.5 hours scheduled per day of travel. That’s reasonable enough that it’s covered by stops they’d already be making to ogle tourist attractions and nourish themselves, Musk maintains.
https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/375538043945373697
Musk won’t be the first to cross the U.S. in a Tesla vehicle, but the point of the trip is for the CEO to defray apprehension about the possibility of doing so, and for him to use the new Supercharger network as a way to call attention to Tesla’s success in covering the U.S. in all its clean energy glory.
This would make a wonderful reality show, but we’ll probably have to settle for snippets from Musk on Twitter and via the official Tesla blog. Here’s hoping for plenty of pictures of Musk and co. mugging next to ‘America’s largest Turkey statue’ or whatever else they happen to come across.

521,Inside Tesla’s Supercharger Partner Program: The Costs And Commitments Of Electrifying Road Transport,https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/26/inside-teslas-supercharger-partner-program-the-costs-and-commitments-of-electrifying-road-transport/,2013/07/26,"
Tesla is building a nationwide network of Supercharger stations in the U.S. to help give its growing fleet of consumer vehicles the juice they need to conquer the nation’s highways, and now we at TechCrunch have an inside look at how they’re approaching partners to help them expand. Tesla’s footing the bill for the Supercharger spots, asking only for time and access from partners with parking lots, and promising the keys to the future in return.
For “prospective hosts” of Tesla Superchargers, the ask isn’t too steep: Tesla covers all costs, upfront and ongoing associated with installing supercharger stations, according to the documents obtained by TechCrunch. That covers maintenance, as well as power costs, with Tesla optionally offering to install a dedicated meter just for the charging station alone, from which the bill will go directly to Tesla itself.
The cost for Tesla is between $100,000 and $175,000 depending on the station, and a lot of those come from the permanent modifications needed at the site to support the Supercharger itself. It’s more expensive than putting in a charger for a standard electric car, like a Nissan Leaf for instance, but the Supercharger can deliver around five times the power of those stations in the same amount of time, and is more demanding in terms of infrastructure changes as a result.
A property owner doesn’t have to stake any monetary commitment, but it does have to offer up between four or five spaces on average, plus around 200 to 600 square feet for Superchargers and equipment. Most agreements involve four “dedicated” stations, designed such that only Tesla owners can use them (prevents a driver arriving and not being able to find a spot), as well as between four and six additional stations that can accommodate both normal cars and provide supercharging for Teslas. This doesn’t need to be prime real estate either, though Tesla does stipulate it be well-lit, and close to existing power infrastructure if possible.
Partners are asked to commit to the program for a minimum of five years, with an option to expand, and most agreements range from five to ten years. The length of the commitment required reflects the large cost of the initial install. In exchange, Tesla is selling essentially the image benefits associated with its brand; partners get the mystique and influence of being a Tesla location, attracting its drivers to their on-site businesses, yes, but also offering up press and social media profile bumps. Plus, for companies with environmental sustainability programs and priorities, the brand association benefits are obviously attractive, too.
The Tesla docs also show a high rate of usage at its stations, with some installations seeing as many as 17 sessions per day during their peak usage periods, a fact which it can use to convince partners that the space provided will result in more traffic to their stores and businesses. Installation of the Supercharger requires between 12 and 20 weeks to complete, but only between two and four of those actually take place on-site, with the rest consisting of paperwork, business arrangements and obtaining local permits and approvals.
If Tesla’s footing the entire bill, it might seem like a no-brainer to get a Supercharger installed at your roadside business, but there is a significant cost involved in terms of construction time and space committed, so it’s understandable that the electric car company has to make its case through these pitch documents. For us, they provide an interesting look at what’s required from all parties involved to help pave the way for the future of electric transport.

522,"A New Place For Better Place, As Bankrupt $800M+ Backed Electric Car Startup Sold For $12M",https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/12/a-new-place-for-better-place-as-bankrupt-800m-backed-electric-car-startup-sold-for-12m/,2013/07/12,"
Looks like we have a final chapter for Better Place, the Israel-based electric car tech startup that raised $786 million plus $50 million in debt, only to then file for bankruptcy in May: it has now been acquired by a group called Sunrise, headed by green-technology entrepreneur Yosef Abramowitz and the Association for the Promotion of the Electric Car in Israel.
According to court filings, Sunrise is paying 18 million Israeli shekels ($5 million) for Better Place’s assets in Israel, and another 25 million shekels ($7 million) for its intellectual property, held by Better Place Switzerland. Sunrise was one of two bidders for the company, the other being a consortium including Success Parking Ltd. and U.S. electric car charging company Car Charging Group Inc.
It’s a whimper of an ending for a company that raised hundreds of millions, and many hopes, for its core business: a system that relied on smartgrid technology to create a network of battery swapping stations and other charging points for users of electric cars.
Speeding up battery charging, which typically can take anywhere from between 4 and 12 hours to charge on electric cars, could significantly spur the convenience factor of these vehicles, and help with consumer adoption. Better Place also had other ideas about how, with the rise of electric cars, power usage overall needed to be better managed.
But it seems that even if the vision was big, business was not. Creating a breakthrough technology that relies on industrial-scale overhauls is capital intensive. And there is the question of critical mass for electric car technology: apparently only 950 cars fitted with Better Place’s replaceable battery technology — the core of the business — were sold since 2012 (it looks like the only carmaker to sign on with Better Place was Renault).
Meanwhile, individual car companies like Tesla working on proprietary solutions are a sign that the space is perhaps still too fragmented and nascent for what Better Place had in mind.
Although the downward spiral from bankruptcy to bidding to eventual sale was swift, the writing was on the wall months before, when founder Shai Agassi was removed as CEO in October 2012.
New owners Sunrise are keeping 50 out of Better Place’s 85 remaining employees, and will operate 15 of its charging stations for a period of at least two years. It may not be complete curtains for all of Better Place’s efforts, depending on how Sunrise chooses to use the IP it purchased as well, but it’s not a great day for the wider ambition to move us away from fossil fuel consumption and towards more sustainable progress.

Solar panels need plenty of sun to work well so why not carry them around on your head? That’s the slightly off-the-wall thinking behind this U.K.-based Kickstarter campaign aiming to produce a pair of solar headphones.
The OnBeat headphones have a flexible solar panel embedded around the band where it’ll be exposed to ample rays — assuming you’re wearing the headphones outdoors. The panel then charges a pair of lightweight lithium ion batteries located inside the ear cups, and there’s a USB port on one of the cups for outputting charge to the smartphone or tablet you want to keep topped up on the go.
Exactly how much charge you’re going to get from such a small panel is unclear — especially considering the entire panel is not going to be in full sun at once, being as it’s curved around your head. OnBeat’s creators say the solar cell has a surface area of 55cm3 with a charge capacity of approximately 0.55W.
The creators also claim the headphones can keep another device juiced up all day, albeit they’re not backing up that claim with any sample charging data yet. It seems likely the output is only going to be enough to keep your phone or tablet ticking over rather than fully charging it, so manage your expectations accordingly. The headphones themselves can also be charged via USB from a computer or mains socket if you want to make sure their batteries contain a full power charge when setting out.
On the audio side, the headphones have the following vital statistics:

Audio driver unit size: 40mm
Impedance: 32 +/- 10% Ohm
Frequency response: 20hz to 20,000Khz
Sensitivity: 100 +/- 3 dB

OnBeat’s creators say they are taking to Kickstarter to seek funds in order to be able to pay for a large enough initial production run to hit their manufacturer’s minimum order. Which means they are seeking a rather ambitious £200,000 ($298,000) to get their solar headphones off the ground and onto people’s heads. RRP is intended to be around £119.00 per pair, but it has multiple pledge tiers offering the headphones for a lot less, starting from £69.

524,Valta Turns To Kickstarter To Fund Home Gadget Energy Management Platform,https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/04/valta-turns-to-kickstarter-to-fund-home-gadget-energy-management-platform/,2013/07/04,"

Toronto-based startup Valta is looking for Kickstarter funding to help it bring its remote energy-management system to life, in order to give homeowners complete control over power usage by devices in any home. It combines special socket attachments with a hub, iPhone app and web-based application to deliver energy waste monitoring, as well as remote control of unused devices sapping juice.
Valta works by combining sockets with built-in chipsets designed for energy management that can detect inert power vampires with an app that can receive push alerts for when energy is wasted. You can turn off the socket completely from your phone to save energy when that happens, and view which of your home devices are in a “standby” state, where they’re plugged in and consuming juice but not actively being used.
The system also uses geofencing to turn off gadgets when you leave the house and turn them back on when you return, which takes away the chance that you simply forget to do it on your own. You can also schedule power off and on events, like turning on the coffee maker or turning off your home theatre, as well as group devices together for easy management of a number at one time. Valta tracks all data and presents it via app- and web-based dashboards that fetch info from cloud-based servers, so you can see how your energy consumption is trending over time.
The Internet-connected v-Hub is what ties the cloud to the socket adapters to the iPhone and web apps, which plugs into your home router via Ethernet and can pair with up to 16 individual sockets. Valta also plans to release an Android app in addition to the iPhone app that will be available at launch, the company says. The founding team has lots of experience in hardware engineering, iOS and cloud computing programming and electrical engineering. They have the chops to pull this off, and now they need the cash, which is why they’re looking for $100,000 to get it off the ground.
Backer pre-order systems start at $139, which gets the v-Hub and three sockets, which is around $55 less than what Valta plans to charge at retail when it ships sometime around November.

Here’s a neat gizmo for speeding up charging your smartphone over USB. The Practical Meter plugs into the USB socket you intend to use to charge your phone and has built-in indicator lights to show how fast the charging connection is. The problem its creators are attacking is the vast difference in charging rates over USB. Charge speed can vary depending on the device you’re charging and the USB port and charger cable you’re using. Yet this difference isn’t usually flagged up to the user.
The Practical Meter solves that problem by displaying the charging strength of the current combination — using signal bar style indicator lights — so it’s possible to figure out whether the phone is going to be fully charged in about an hour. Or require more like four hours to get juiced up. Here’s an example of the Practical Meter’s signal scale when charging an iPhone:

The Practical Meter has already passed its $10,000 funding goal on Kickstarter, with more than 3,200 backers and still more than 20 days to run on the campaign. Shipping date is pegged at September. Price per Meter is now $19, which also includes a three-in-one charger cable that’s designed to enhance charging performance. This cable has an Apple dock, Micro USB and Mini USB ends so it’s compatible with a range of phones.
Each of the three connectors has built-in circuits to maximise its charge rate — meaning the cable alone can speed up charging performance, according to its creators (the price for just the cable is $7).
Another possible use for the Practical Meter is in combination with a solar charging panel, as it allows the user to figure out the best position to place the panel to maximise its power output. The device can also be used for figuring out tablet charging rates too — although its creators note that it only meters the first 1000 mA (1 amp) of current, adding: “With our charging tips you will be able to draw 5 watts or 1000 mA of current into your ipad from your PC/Laptop! Stay tuned to learn about the possibility of a 10-watt version or stretch goal.”

If you’re anything like the average technology writer you’ll have a drawer full of old kit lying around the place, gathering dust. Well here’s what looks like a neat use for old smartphones that are still functional even if they’re no longer good enough to be your everyday device. Reusing tech kit so it gets a second life to extend its usefulness is obviously to be encouraged — and the plethora of sensors in the average smartphone mean there are plenty of options for use number 2.
U.S. startup, Xavage Technologies, has come up with one: it’s created a phone-housing-plus-app combo — which it’s calling Xentry — that turns an old iPhone or Galaxy S Fascinate into a door-mounted caller-display so you can see who’s at the door and communicate with them via the corresponding app on your own in play smartphone. The old phone is mounted on the inside of your front door, with a customised peephole attachment replacing an existing peephole lens, allowing the phone’s camera to spy on whoever’s outside.
The “smart door” system streams real-time video and audio over your home Wi-Fi network so no need to have a SIM in the door-mounted smartphone. Other features include the ability to disguise your voice when you respond to the caller at the door; door movement detection (using the phone’s gyroscope) so that you can set alerts if someone is trying to enter or exit the house; and a virtual receptionist feature to trigger a message when someone opens the door.
The app also lets you take still photos of the video of whoever is at the door, and supports zooming and exposure adjustment. Simultaneous connection to the door-mounted camera is also supported meaning multiple in-home smartphone owners can see who’s outside.
Xavage is looking to raise $200,000 via Indiegogo to fund production of the two Xentry models, one designed to house old iPhones (3GS/4/4S) and one for the Samsung Galaxy S Fascinate (chosen because it was a popular device in the U.S. market in 2010). The phone housing will be manufactured from either ABS or recycled ABS. The top housing may be aluminium in the shipping version of the product. Xavage added that it plans to expand the range to other “top selling smartphones”, and is working on a universal model for business applications that can be attached to glass surfaces, such as office doors.
Charging the Xentry sounds like it may be a bit of a chore. The housing is designed to incorporate the phone’s charging cable but Xavage adds: “Backers are expected to use their existing charging plug and USB cable while Xavage provides a 15 feet (3 meter) USB adaptor cable.”
So, in other words, you’re going to have to plug a charger cable into the device that’s mounted to your door for at least some of the time. Unless the phone can easily be removed from the housing for charging. Still, for a little inconvenience, you’re getting a low upfront cost video caller door display — and reusing your old phone to boot. The cost per Xentry looks to be around $55. The startup expects to be shipping its first batch in December, if it makes funding.
Update: Xavage said it’s looking at a couple of options to improve the charging scenario. “For the first Xentry model, our power solution is to have the unit connected to the wall outlet via a charging cable. This solution doesn’t impede the normal operation of the door. For next generations we are optimizing our software for power.  Additionally, we are looking at an extended battery or a retractable cable system inside the unit.”
It added that the current version of the app, which streams video only when a viewer is connected to the camera and viewing mode is selected, should support about two days of battery life.

527,"Tesla Shows Off A 90-Second Battery Swap System, Wants It At Supercharging Stations By Year’s End",https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/20/tesla-shows-off-a-90-second-battery-swap-system-wants-it-at-supercharging-stations-by-years-end/,2013/06/20,"
Tesla teased electric motorheads earlier this week by announcing an event that would show off its curious battery-swapping system, and it wound up being even more impressive than most of us imagined. Long story short, Tesla can swap a Model S’s battery in just 90 seconds (that’s less time than it takes to fuel up a regular car), and you won’t even have to get out of your seat to do it.
“We designed Model S from the beginning to be capable of swapping out the battery pack faster than you can fill a gas tank,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk said at the company’s Hawthorne design studio earlier this evening.
It’s not exactly a secret that the Model S’s battery pack can be switched out as needed, but the company saw fit to keep the details under wraps until today. For the process to run that quickly, you’d expect some technical wizardry to come into play and Tesla certainly delivers. Once a Model S owner parks the car on a designated spot, a platform raises from the ground to disconnect and grab hold of the depleted battery. The platform then descends back into the ground, dumps the battery, retrieves a fresh one, and rises once more to connect it to the car.
Really, it’s one of those things you need to see:

Frenzied drivers will still have to do some work, though — they’ll have to drop off the battery on the return leg of their journey and pay an unspecified “transport fee,” though they can also choose to keep the battery and pony up the difference between the price of the old and new batteries. The first swap-capable locations will be at supercharger stations located along California’s I-5, though the company plans to bring them online at east coast superchargers in short order.
Judging from the videos pouring out of the event, the overall tone of the presentation was exuberant, and it’s hard not to see why: The company is looking at hot-swappable batteries for its electric vehicles as a way to put them on even footing with traditional gas-powered cars. Of course, that’s not to say that bringing those changeable batteries to the masses is going to be easy.
Tesla has spent more than a year constructing supercharger stations along the east and west coasts in a bid to give their electric cars the juice to complete your average languorous summer road trip. Outfitting each of those stations with the ability to quickly replace batteries and get motorists back on the road presents quite a logistics problem. There’s the cost to consider — Tesla expects each battery swap station to cost about $500,000 to build, to say nothing of the maintenance and infrastructure costs that will come now that someone presumably has to stop by each station and replace worn-down batteries. Still, Tesla already has plans to triple the size of its supercharger network. If every one of them is slated to get battery-swapping stations, the prospect of trying to cruise the country in an electric car just got a lot less sketchy.
UPDATE: Tesla has posted an official version of the video with a bigger focus on how darned fast the process is. Check it out.

Here’s a neat greentech idea currently seeking crowdfunding on Kickstarter. SunnyBot is a microcomputer-powered robot that continually tracks the position of the sun, angling its on-board mirror so that it keeps reflecting the sun’s rays onto a fixed point of your choice. The basic idea being to harness solar energy for use as an indoor light-source when rooms might otherwise be in shade, or to target the sun’s heat where it’s needed — for warming a room or heating a swimming pool or nurturing indoor plants, and so on.
SunnyBot’s creators — an Italian startup called Solenica — say the bot can also be used to improve solar charging performance by concentrating the sun’s energy. A single SunnyBot redirects 7,000 lumens to the location of your choice (equivalent to a single 500W halogen lamp). The reflective range of the device is up to 200 metres away, with an accuracy error margin of as little as 0.1 meter over 30 meters.
Obviously, the SunnyBot needs to be able to see sun in the sky to work — so residents of Iceland in December are going to find it brings them very little light relief. But amplifying the effects of sunlight in countries when sunshine is not so plentiful is one application its creators envisage for the device. In countries where sunshine is plentiful, the bot’s use-case is better targeting of the sun’s natural energy to improve the human environment.
Inside the sun-tracking mirror-wielding bot, itself powered by a row of solar cells, is a dual-axis, integrated microcomputer with an optical feedback system. The current SunnyBot design is a prototype, so its technical specifications will be tweaked as the startup moves to industrial production, with additional elements intended to be added to the design to improve durability, such as a custom enclosure for the mirror to support and contain it, and also the use of injection moulding for high quality body and mechanical parts.
Solenica is also planning to offer an open source version of the SunnyBot — called SunnyDuino — that, for a small price premium, will come with an additional Arduino-compatible controller and SDK so bot owners can hack in to the device to develop their own functionalities for its targeted beam of light and heat.
Solenica is aiming to raise £200,000 ($312,000) via Kickstarter to step up to industrial manufacturing so it can bring the device market. It also plans to spend some of the money on marketing SunnyBot, as it ramps up to license it to global manufacturers. It says it believes it can ship the first production run of the bot in time for the 2013 holiday season.
SunnyBot will be assembled in Italy, with macro components produced in different locations, including the electronic boards in Cambridge, U.K.; microcontrollers in Arizona, U.S.; and mechanical parts in Modena, Italy. The consumer cost per bot looks likely to be several hundred pounds. There are a limited number of Kickstarter pledges costing £199 ($310) which include one device. Solenica’s Diva Tommei adds: “We are hoping, after the project is over, to decrease costs of production and therefore the price of the robot. We want SunnyBot to be a household object that anyone can afford.”

Congress is on track to passing a nationwide Internet retail sales tax, but it has serious flaws that could majorly muck up the e-commerce industry. We think citizens are often smarter than the government, and we want to give you a chance to make the bill better before it becomes law. So, we’ve teamed up with Congressman Darrell Issa’s Open Government Foundation, which designed a platform for making line-by-line suggestions to proposed laws. In TechCrunch’s version of the “Project Madison” crowdsourcing legislative platform, our readers can add, delete, and amend specific passages in the upcoming tax law.
Suggestions that are voted up by our community will get the most attention of Congressional staffers (which we know are watching our platform). It’s been claimed that the Internet is “democratizing” the world; well, here’s our chance to prove it.
Senate Bill S.743, the “Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013,” passed the Senate with overwhelming support and is on to the House of Representatives. But, it won’t be passed for at least a month, so we have some time to bubble up the best ideas from our community of readers.
As we promised when we first launched our new civics channel, Crunchgov, TechCrunch would source and promote the most insightful ideas from the technology community. A proactive approach to improving law is just the next logical step for how we can support the amazing work you all do.
Go to http://madison.techcrunch.com/ and get your citizen on. Encourage your friends, ping your local expert, and share  this opportunity loudly. If we make an impact on the bill, it’ll a watershed moment in American democracy. Go forth!

530,We’re “80% Of The Way” To Fake Meat That’s Indistinguishable From The Real Thing,https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/07/were-80-of-the-way-to-fake-meat-thats-indistinguishable-from-the-real-thing/,2013/05/07,"
If you’ve flirted with vegetarianism like I have, then you’re probably aware of a range of meat substitutes, all of which pale in comparison to the real thing. But now Beyond Meat CEO and founder Ethan Brown says that mock meat is about 80 percent of the way to being able to sub in for the real thing without anyone being the wiser, in terms of taste, texture and appearance.
Brown made that claim on stage today at the WIRED Business Conference, where he was discussing the role of proteins in our diet in general and how Silicon Valley investment-backed startups like his own are trying to shake up perhaps one of the oldest and most entrenched industries: the meat market.
Beyond Meat grabbed headlines as an unlikely target for investment by Obvious Corp., the investment vehicle/incubator/idea factory co-founded by Biz Stone and Evan Williams of Twitter fame. In a blog post from August, Stone outlined exactly why Obvious felt that Beyond Meat was a prime investment target, and how it aligned with the Obvious vision.
Beyond Meat will become the market leader in the development and introduction of new plant protein products. Together, we are focused on perfectly replacing animal protein with plant protein where doing so creates nutritional value at lower cost. Aside from the fact that the products are healthy, sustainable, kind, and delicious, we are involved because with one company, we have an impact on climate change, resource scarcity, human health, animal welfare, and more. With this company, we can move into new territory while staying true to Obvious’ mission.
The Obvious goal is to “build systems that help people work together to make the world a better place,” and Beyond Meat definitely fits within that broad aim. On stage, Brown talked about the time saved in raising non-meat protein versus that which comes from animal sources, which is a comparison of minutes for his company’s products to days for even the fastest-grown animal protein, which doesn’t even begin to get into ethical concerns.
For Brown, a big part of winning the war with the consumer over meat alternatives is convincing them to try it to begin with, and that starts with giving them a recognizable product. Already, he says people find it challenging to identify Beyond Meat’s own chicken substitute as something other than chicken, except when it’s placed side-by-side with the real thing. But the key to wide adoption, and winning over a much bigger percentage of the roughly $177 billion annual animal protein market that exists today, will be achieving full verisimilitude. And part of that means getting equal billing with the red and bloody stuff.
“The meat counter for me is about an unlevelled playing field,” Brown explained on stage at the Wired event today. “They should be selling protein, not meat and meat alternatives. So when you go back to that section in the store it should be about protein, because often when you go back and are looking for a meat alternative, those products are off in a penalty box in the corner.”
Many vegetarians claim not to want meat substitutes that look, feel and taste like the real thing, but there’s an even larger market of people who are trying to limit their meat intake for health purposes but don’t want to leave the satisfaction of biting into a chicken breast or flank steak behind. That’s what has helped Beyond Meat’s business grow at a rate of 60 percent this past quarter, and 30 percent in the last month alone, according to Brown.
Solving the meat eater’s dilemma is a tech problem, and so it makes sense that investors like Obvious Corp., Vinod Khosla, and many others are interested in the space. But will we ever really get to a singularity point where we can’t tell our turkey from our Tofurky? Or will we all fall down in the uncanny valley just short of finding a perfect copy? Either way, it’s bound to be an exciting space to watch.

531,SupplyShift Helps Companies Understand The Environmental Impact Of Their Supply Chain,https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/30/supplyshift-helps-companies-understand-the-environmental-impact-of-their-supply-chain/,2013/04/30,"
For large companies that have a long list of suppliers that they work with, it’s not only difficult to manage communication with all of them, but understanding the environmental impact of each supplier is next to impossible. It’s not a sexy space to work in by any means but the addressable market is comprised of Fortune 500 companies and the government itself, which is bound to mandates involving environmental sustainability when working with suppliers.
SupplyShift is a backend tool for those companies and organizations to track everything that’s going on with suppliers, which are usually scattered throughout the world. These buyers are collecting sustainability data but don’t currently have the tools to help them reduce risk exposure.
What SupplyShift really is is a network which allows them to understand their “supply chain footprint” which will make suppliers actually care more about how they present themselves, heating up competing among them. The team, led by CEO and cofounder Alexander Gershenson, has been working on these problems as a consultant and it was time to build their work out as an actual product.

Currently, Ecoshift, the consulting arm for the team, is already hosting panels with companies like Microsoft, Target and Sprint on supply chain management.
The type of risk that companies experience with suppliers are the situation that Mattel went through with lead paint, where 1M toys had to be recalled. As far as how suppliers can affect how the public thinks about your company, look no further than Apple’s relationship with Foxconn, regarding their labor practices. You get the point. SupplyShift will track all of these potential risks, sharing them among the network of companies that use it.

Why now? Gershenson told me: “The market situation changed radically in the last three years, and sustainability is becoming a key part of corporate strategy, but corporations and the government do not have the tools to address that need. SupplyShift takes care of that.”
The main component that makes SupplyShift different from its competitors is that the companies who use the service are also paying to enroll their suppliers. This is key, because suppliers either won’t, or can’t afford to enroll themselves in similar services. By putting this in the hands of the companies who are selling goods, the database of suppliers will grow at a more rapid rate.
This isn’t a social network for professionals, photo-sharing apps for tweens, but it’s a product that provides important information that could save companies millions of dollars in bad PR and lawsuits due to critical mistakes made by a supplier.

Kickstarter might be better known for funding films and hardware projects, but it’s now getting its first synthetic biology proposal. A Singularity University alum, a Stanford post-doc and a Stanford Ph.D. are looking to use synthetic biology and software from startup Genome Compiler to creating plants that glow.
While the first several generations of plants might be weaker at emitting light, the long-term idea is to replace electric or gas lighting with natural lighting from plants.
“We live in a world that is generating too much carbon dioxide,” said Antony Evans, who is one of the three people behind the project. “Nature has figured out ways of creating energy that don’t require so much CO2 use, and what we really want to do is awaken people to the potential of that. Instead of having all these expensive street lights, why don’t we get plants?”
With the project, they’re inserting bioluminescence genes into a small flowering plant called Arabidopsis that’s part of the mustard family.
They’re looking for $65,000 in funding to print DNA sequences they’ve designed using the Genome Compiler software and then to create rewards for backers like “Maker” kits that let you create your own glowing plants. The startup associated with the project, Genome Compiler, lets people easily design genetic sequences and order them online.
 
The project comes at a time when costs around both genome sequencing and DNA printing are falling precipitously. Printing DNA at this points costs at least 25 cents per base pair. So for an 8,000-character sequence, they’re looking at at least $2,000 per unique sequence.
They’ll test a number of experimental sequences and print them with partner and Silicon Valley startup Cambrian Genomics, which has made a DNA laser printing system that cuts the cost of DNA synthesis dramatically. Then they’ll use bacteria as a vector to insert the new DNA into the plant.
Evans, who doesn’t have a background in biology at all, got into the field through Singularity University and Biocurious, a bio-hacking space down in Sunnyvale.
His bet is that the next decade will usher in a new era where it’s as easy to hack on animal or plant genomes as it is to build software with Python or Rails. The cost of sequencing a full human genome is falling even faster than Moore’s law would suggest at a current rate $8,000 down from $100 million in 2001. Not only that, DNA printing is getting cheaper as well with companies like Genscript.
They’ve also gone through the regulatory process to ensure that the project is compliant with U.S. law. Regulators from the USDA and EPA are naturally concerned that synthetic plants could become pests and crowd out or compete with natural plants for resources. They check for whether newly designed life forms have genes associated with pests; Evans has cleared this. The third agency that regulates synthetic biology experiments, the FDA, isn’t really involved here because these “Glowing Plants” are inedible.

Biomimicry is an engineering field that takes cues from nature to help solve and address human problems, and Google today launched a new website at its Google Green initiative that highlights some of the ways nature’s engineers can inspire and guide human behavior. The site uses gorgeous National Geographic images along with brief descriptions of how the natural antecedent relates to the human concept, and then provides Google-sourced tools to help people emulate that activity.
Is it basically an ad? Yes. Is it a smart one? Definitely. Google manages to pitch pretty much all of its major web- and app-based offerings and services in a single slide show, with direct integrations built in that make it possible to take immediate action based on the trends they choose to highlight. You can do a local search for recycled and upcycled decorating material, grab apps and movies on the subjects from Google Play, search for maps and join Google+ communities and more. My only complaint is that Google buries the science at the end of the site in linked academic articles for each animal or plant behavior, where those probably should have been at least linked somewhere in each well-designed spread right alongside the Google service advertisements.
Some might call this empty lip-service to Earth Day, which takes place today and probably would be better served by Google powering down a server farm or two for a few hours, but the concepts highlighted (including ride sharing, composting, energy conservation and diet modification) are solid ones and would have genuinely beneficial ecological effects if adopted by large portions of the community. Plus it’s an impressive example of web design in its own right, and a look at what Google can do with content marketing models which could be a key vector for it to exploit as the nature of online advertising continues to shift.

534,Google Asks Utilities To Make It Easier For Companies To Buy Renewable Energy,https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/19/google-utilities-green-energy/,2013/04/19,"
Google has long had an interest in renewable energy and has now invested more than $1 billion of its own money in alternative energy projects. However, as the company notes in a blog post and white paper today, it’s not always easy for companies that want to buy renewable energy to do so, given that most utilities don’t yet offer a renewable power option yet. In its white paper, Google lays out a plan that would make it easier for more companies to buy green energy.
Currently, Google says, businesses have the option to install on-site generation (like the solar cells on its Mountain View headquarters’ roof), buy renewable energy certificates or to sign power purchase agreements. All of these approaches, however, Google argues, have significant downsides. On-site generation usually can’t produce enough energy to power a facility 24/7, for example, and renewable energy certificates don’t “provide assurance that the price paid for RECs is being used to support additional investment in new renewable power generation.”

For the most part, companies also have to accept that at least a part of their generation mix includes some carbon-intensive sources. Currently, if a company wants renewable power — and is willing to pay for it — it still can’t get it in most places because it’s simply not being offered.
The reason for this, Google argues, is that historically, utilities never designed their rate schedules around a specific category of power generation (though it’s worth noting that at least some utilities recently started offering this option). Instead, the focus was always purely on cost and reliability.
So how does Google plan to change this? The company wants utilities to offer companies like Google the choice to buy renewable energy through a new class of service. The service would be voluntary, provided only to those companies that request it but open to all customers that want it and meet basic criteria.” The cost of procuring the renewable energy would only be passed on to those customers who select this option and not impact anybody else.
You can read more about the exact details of the proposal here, and we have embedded the proposal below.
Google also plans to put this plan into action. As part of the planned $600 million expansion of its Lenoir, N.C. data center, the company has partnered with Duke Energy to develop a new program based on its ideas. Duke Energy still has to file this plan with the N.C. state commission, though, which Google says it will do within the next 90 days.

535,Tokyo’s Terra Motors Wants To Help Electric Vehicle Transport Go Green From The Ground Up,https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/02/tokyos-terra-motors-wants-to-help-electric-vehicle-transport-go-green-from-the-ground-up/,2013/04/02,"


Japanese startup Terra Motors officially debuted its electric tuk-tuk (a type of three-wheeled passenger vehicle common in Asia), a tricycle that costs just over $6,000 U.S. and gets 31 miles on a 2 hour charge. The electric vehicle stands at the opposite end of the spectrum from something like the Tesla Model S Roadster, and for good reason: it’s designed to be affordable for emerging markets in large quantities.
The first fleet is already on order for the Philippines (via CNET), as part of a plan to replace 100,000 gas-powered tuk-tuks in that country by 2016, with more efficient, cost-effective electric vehicles. They’ll be offered to passenger transport drivers across the country on a lease-to-own basis, and should save those drives up to $5 per day in fuel costs, as well as cut down on air pollution on the ground in some very densely populated urban areas.
The Terra Motors electric trike isn’t exactly cheap at $6,300 (gas-powered models can be had for between $1,000 to around $1,500 depending on seating capacity and amenities), but it’s fundamentally opposite from something like a Tesla, which actually just axed its cheapest entry-level model citing poor demand. Terra Motors Director of Business Development Tetsuya Ohashi said in an email that the goal is to start expanding its business to the broader Asian market as quickly as possible, and hitting the right price point is a key ingredient in that strategy.
The Terra Motors tuk-tuk is also quite the looker, with a space-age design and ample interior seating, so it’s got that going for it over its gas-powered brethren, too. 31 miles isn’t terrific in terms of range, but these are designed as in-city transport for short trips. Still, having to bog down for two hours every time you hit that limit also isn’t going to be ideal, but the money saved in gas expenses could make up for the down time, especially if planned properly.
Terra has impressive investors, including former top execs from Apple Japan, Google Japan, Sony and Compaq. Chinese companies already market electric tuk-tuks, but none are quite as ambitious as this new prototype from Terra, and while a Dutch company called The Tuk Tuk Factory launched an EV a couple of years ago called the e-Tuk, it’s aimed primarily at the European market, so Terra has a chance to make a big splash depending on its reception.

There is no shortage of cloud-based file storage and synchronization solutions: Dropbox, Box.net, Ubuntu One, and on and on and on. Most offer pretty much the same things. A few niche players offer something special, like Spideroak‘s approach to encryption, or ownCloud‘s host-it-yourself solution.  QloudSync puts forward two interesting differentiators: it’s powered by 100% renewable energy, and it’s hosted in Iceland.
From a feature perspective, QloudSync isn’t anything new. File storage and synchronization. Share links with others. Stream music and video.  The client apps are open source, and built atop SparkleShare.
QloudSync runs on GreenQloud‘s ComputeQloud and StorageQloud, which offer API compatibility with Amazon EC2 and S3. What is different about GreenQloud’s offerings, though, are that they run on renewable energy and claim to be carbon neutral, without the use of emissions offsets of any kind. Users of GreenQloud’s services can easily share their carbon savings to the social media outlet of their choice.

We see a great opportunity in utilizing Iceland’s abundant 100% renewable geothermal and hydro energy infrastructure, naturally cool climate and strategic location as a means to clean up IT and greatly reduce the industry’s carbon footprint.

GreenQloud is also making a strong play for the fact that they’re hosted in Iceland. According to them, your data “is safe from SOPA, PIPA, ACTA, Patriot act because StorageQloud runs from data centers in Iceland.” This doesn’t strike me as strong reason to use GreenQloud by itself, but it may be one of several that makes them a more attractive option in the sea of similar products.

537,"Ease The Geek Rage: Obama’s Technically Right, There Is a Jedi Meld",https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/01/ease-the-geek-rage-obamas-technically-right-there-is-a-jedi-meld/,2013/03/01,"Correction: There is a Jedi meld  starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Force_meld (h/t @thegarance)— BuzzFeed News (@BuzzFeedNews) March 01, 2013

President Obama inadvertently triggered national geek outrage, after he mistakenly mixed up the warring science fiction universes of Star Wars and Star Trek. During a press conference related to recently triggered budget cutbacks, known as the “sequester,” he said, “I can’t do some kind of Jedi Mind Meld on congressional Republicans,” referring to the partisan gridlock that has prevented Congress from passing a budget. Twitter immediately lit up with comments poking fun of the fact that Obama mixed up Star Wars’ ‘Jedi Mind Trick‘, used for mind control, and Star Trek‘s Vulcan ‘Mind Meld’, for sharing thoughts.
Obama just said ""Jedi mindmeld."" What's next, Klingon lightsabers? #Shame #Impeach— rob delaney (@robdelaney) March 01, 2013
A few savvy (i.e. super-geeky) users pointed out that there is, in fact, a Jedi mind meld, employed in later books of the Star Wars universe. According to a Wikia entry,
Force Meld, otherwise known as Jedi meld or Battle meld, was a technique where a number of Force users joined their minds together through the Force, drawing strength from each other. A refinement of battle meditation, it was known to the ancient Jedi, though dangerous. While battle meditation could influence both the Force-sensitives and the insensitives of both sides, Force Meld concentrates on coordinating and improving the Force-sensitives of the user’s side.
Now, did Obama use the phrase correctly? Probably not. Is he a hyper-wonky follower of the post-movie Star Wars universe? Even less likely. Did I make a horrible mistake as a writer getting into the middle of a nuanced sci-fi debate? Yes, most definitely.

538,Making It Illegal To Fail Science Students Who Argue Humans Co-Existed With Dinosaurs,https://techcrunch.com/2013/02/22/making-it-illegal-to-fail-science-students-who-argue-humans-co-existed-with-dinosaurs/,2013/02/22,"
As American science students struggle to compete with the global competition, Oklahoma is moving forward with a law that could ban Biology teachers from failing students who argue that humans co-existed with dinosaurs. The state legislator’s committee in charge of education standards has approved a law that would forbid teachers from penalizing students who argue against widely accepted scientific theories, such as evolution and climate change.
“I proposed this bill because there are teachers and students who may be afraid of going against what they see in their textbooks,” said Republican State Representative Gus Blackwell who sponsored the Scientific Education and Academic Freedom Act, which can now go the state legislature for a vote.
Students are not exempt from being tested on textbook material, “but no student in any public school or institution shall be penalized in any way because the student may subscribe to a particular position on scientific theories,” reads the bill [PDF].
Not everyone is ecstatic about the bill, however. “An extremely high percentage of scientists will tell you that evolution doesn’t have scientific weaknesses,” said education director of the National Center for Science Education, Eric Meikle, to Mother Jones. “If every teacher, parent, and school board can decide what to teach on their own, you’re going to have chaos. You can’t deluge kids with every theory that’s ever been considered since the beginning of time.”

539,Elon Musk Lays Out His Evidence That New York Times Tesla Model S Test Drive Was “Fake”,https://techcrunch.com/2013/02/14/elon-musk-lays-out-his-evidence-that-new-york-times-tesla-model-s-test-drive-was-fake/,2013/02/14,"
Tesla Motors CEO and founder Elon Musk definitely isn’t the best guy to try to pull a fast one on. The visionary entrepreneur set Twitter a titter when he claimed earlier this week that New York Times writer John Broder had fudged details about the Tesla Models S car’s range in cold weather, resulting in what he termed a “fake” article. Musk promised evidence, and now he has delivered, via the official Tesla blog.
In keeping with his brief description of what was wrong with the review from his original tweet, Musk laid out how vehicle logs (standard practice after Tesla ran into issues with Top Gear, which dramatized a breakdown where none actually existed) showed that the car Broder was driving for his article was improperly charged, took an unscheduled side trip and essentially seemed to have been set up to fail.
Musk breaks down what went wrong in a number of bullet points, but basically Broder’s car never ran out of juice completely; was charged to a level which he knew wouldn’t be enough to get to his destination at one point; actually exceeded its anticipated range; was driven past charging stations which could’ve helped it finish the journey; and was taken for a lengthy detour through Manhattan not included in the original trip plan.
Other problems add to the reported deception, including climate control settings that run counter to Broder’s stated claims in the article about what he did with in-car heating (turned up the temp when he said he turned it down). The smaller details aren’t necessarily the most consequential, but the fact that Musk has record of even these smaller contradictions in his test vehicle’s logs helps to paint a picture of a writer who seems to have been blatantly gunning for Tesla from the start.
Musk says that Broder altered details and the conditions of the test to help fit with his pre-existing opinion, which he arrives at thanks to a quote from Broder in an article published in 2012. Broder essentially attempts to deflate the sunny image of a future filled with electric cars, claiming that “the state of the electric car is dismal, the “victim of hyped expectations, technological flops, high costs and a hostile political climate.” To be fair, in that article Broder also goes on to give plenty of space to electric car supporters, too, and even gives the last word to Chris Paine, the documentary filmmaker behind Who Killed the Electric Car?, ending on Paine’s implied accusation that the oil and gas industry are behind stalling the electric future of car transport.
But overall, Musk’s evidence is pretty damning, especially backed up as it is by solid data from the Model S itself. He ends by calling for the NYT to launch an investigation into the article and its writing, and after an attack like this, I’d guess the NYT would have to do just that in order to be able to come up with a satisfactory response.

540,"Social Crowdfunding Platform Rally.org Expands To Europe With New Berlin Incubator And Donations In Euros, With Pounds Coming Soon",https://techcrunch.com/2013/02/07/social-crowdfunding-platform-rally-org-expands-to-europe-with-new-berlin-incubator/,2013/02/07,"
Rally.org, the U.S.-based crowdfunding platform designed for socially-minded causes, is taking its mission to Europe. Today, the startup is opening an incubator in Berlin, its first outside of the U.S., and on a limited beta will start to process donations made on its proprietary payment platform in euros, with the intention of adding British pounds and other currencies in the very near future.
Rally.org — which, commendably, used its own platform to raise $7.9 million from the likes of Relay Ventures, Mike Maples of Floodgate Fund, Reid Hoffman of Greylock Partners, Kevin Rose of Google Ventures, Craig Shapiro of Collaborative Fund, Michael Birch of Bebo, Tim Ferriss and Eric Ries — recently passed 3 million people contributing to 23,000 campaigns on its platform, and the idea is to tap into more local social causes and fundraising activities in this part of the world to grow that base even more. 
In an interview with TechCrunch, Rally.org co-founder and CEO Tom Serres says that the company chose Berlin for its incubator and head office partly because Rally.org had already opened a Rallypad co-working space of sorts in the city last year; and partly because it’s a very startup-friendly city economically (in other words, it doesn’t cost an arm and a leg to start a new company there). “We wanted a community, not just a product,” he said.
But the intention is to expand very soon to the UK, which Serres notes has the highest concentration in Europe of people who donate money to good causes. For Rally.org, a cause can be anything from a donation drive for a non-profit; to an environmental startup project aimed at improving, say, energy consumption; to someone looking to raise money for their education — not a small issue in Europe, where student fees are skyrocketing in many countries as states pull back spending in these recessionary times. (Rally takes a 5.75% commission on all final fundraises.)
While crowdfunding sites seem to be approaching a dime a dozen these days, Rally.org has a few points that distinguish it from the pack. Its emphasis on good causes is the obvious one. But the other may be the one that helps it grow: it has built its own payment platform — independent of PayPal, Amazon and the rest — that underpins the service, which is already capable of handling 17 different currencies, says Serres.
“My long term vision is to be the infrastructre of the next economy, the cause economy,” Serres told TechCrunch, describing a future where we make purchasing decisions based on making bigger statements and helping the world: think Tom’s Shoes and its idea of donating one pair to a needy child for each pair bought, expanded into all of your daily transactions. “The idea is: Everywhere I go I make a statement to the world.” 
Serres points out every person who makes a contribution through Rally.org gets a virtual wallet, and the idea is to eventually make that wallet into something that consumers can use for more donations, as well as for purchases elsewhere. 
For now, those posting campaigns on Rally.org will need to have German bank accounts to receive funds — although this will expand over time, Serres says. Companies based in the company’s Berlin incubator — Startup Weekend, music resource-sharing company Muzup, and social relocation community G1OBALS — will be the first Europeans to use the product. Another group is starting a campaign to preserve Berlin’s princesses garden, Prinzessinnengarten.

You know those mobile devices that everyone keeps raving about? Turns out it’s a huge business. Shocker, I know. Strategy Analytics recently estimated that about 1.6 billion mobile phones shipped in 2012. What’s more, according to Canalys’ report today, the tablet market grew by 75 percent in the fourth quarter to 46.2 million units, with total shipments hitting 114.6 million in 2012.
With all these new devices hitting the market, people tend to overlook the fact that this creates an enormous amount of waste. ecoATM debuted in 2011 with a green solution: Give consumers an easy way to recycle their used electronics. The San Diego-based startup has been on a mission to become the Coinstar for used, mobile devices, offering consumers ATM-like kiosks that automate the buy-back of their has-been electronics and give them a cash reward for doing so.
With the tablet market growing like gangbusters, last week, the company expanded its support to include tablets, which means that its kiosks will now accept your iPads in addition to your cell phones, smartphones and MP3 players. Over the last year, the startup has gone from 50 kiosks to about 300 across 20 states, and this year, it hopes to add another 600 or 700 kiosks, bringing cash for clunky devices to a mall near you.
To support this growth, the 2012 Crunchies Winner announced today that it has secured $40 million in debt financing from Falcon Investment Advisors, which ecoATM CEO Tom Tullie says will help provide the fuel it needs to continue nationwide expansion.
“There’s still a large percentage of the country that doesn’t have access to a convenient recycling solution for their mobile phones and other personal portable electronic devices,” Tullie says of the new debt round. “We raised this money to help us deploy ecoATMs nationwide and help people recycle their old phones, tablets, or MP3 players, regardless of where they live.”
To date, ecoATM’s expansion plan has focused primarily on positioning its kiosks in shopping malls in large metropolitan areas — for good reason — “eventually, we’re going to run out of malls,” ecoATM marketing director Ryan Kuder told us recently. So, with its new capital, the startup wants to expand into smaller cities and other types of high-foot traffic areas, like supermarkets and smaller retail outlets.
And, according to Kuder, the expansion reflects a growing demand (and growing use of) its kiosks among consumers. Yes, people are actually using the machines. Kuder says that people used ecoATM to recycle “hundreds of thousands of phones” last year and has paid out “millions of dollars to hundreds of thousands of customers.”
By doing so, Tullie added, the company has been able to save landfills from “hundreds of thousands of potentially toxic devices,” as it has been able to “find a second life” for 60 percent of the devices it has collected, while recycling the rest.
The new debt round adds to the $17 million in funding it has raised to date from Claremont Creek Ventures, Coinstar, TAO Ventures, PI Holdings, Moore Venture Partners, AKS Capital and Koh Boon Hwee, to name a few. In 2012, the company was also awarded a Phase II grant from the National Science Foundation for up to $1 million. The new financing brings ecoATM’s total funding to just over $70 million.

542,"Apple’s 2013 Supplier Responsibility Report Includes 72% Bump In Audits For 2012, 97% Increase In Training",https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/25/apples-2013-supplier-responsibility-report-includes-72-bump-in-audits-for-2012-97-increase-in-training/,2013/01/25,"
Apple has released its 2013 Supplier Responsibility Progress Report, and it features a number of updates from last year, including Apple’s decision to join the Fair Labor Association (a notable first), and conduct audits of its suppliers in tandem with that outside watchdog organization. The results seem to be a tightening of Apple’s code of conduct for suppliers all around, in terms of monitoring, penalties and programs to improve conditions.
Apple conducted 72 percent more audits in 2012 than it did in 2011, for example, totaling 393 audits across facilities employing 1.5 million workers. All types of audits increased for the year, including firs-time, repeat, process safety assessments and specialized environmental audits, but the last one took the biggest jumps vs. previous years. In 2012, Apple conducted 55 focused environmental audits, which is a 293 percent increase over the number it ran in 2011. The Mac maker works with outside associations in this area, too, just as it does with the FLA regarding labor, including the Natural Defense Council, the EPA and the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs.
The supplier audits also actually resulted in more severe punitive action than usual. Apple has faced criticism in the past for doling out corrective measures that seem rather toothless – most often putting suppliers “on probation,” meaning they’ll be watched more closely for future violations. But one supplier fell afoul of Apple’s measures to protect against underage labor, with 74 cases counted at a single facility. Apple terminated the relationship with that offending party entirely, proving that there are real consequences for companies that ignore its code of conduct and local labor laws.
Apple also came down harder on companies for compliance with working hour regulations, and changed its policies and practices in monitoring them to be more effective. In 2012, Apple started doing real-time work hour tracking on a weekly basis for over 1 million of the employees at its supplier companies, and publishing data on its progress every month. That led to a 92 percent compliance rate with its 60 hour maximum work week, as laid out in the Apple Supplier Code of Conduct, and Apple says overall work weeks averaged less than 50 hours.
Another area of improvement for Apple was in participation in its training and education programs. There were 1.32 million workers trained on local laws, worker rights, health and safety and Apple’s own Code of Conduct during 2012, a 97 percent increase over 2011’s 670,000. Apple also provided more free educational opportunities to workers than ever before, with 201,000 cumulative participants in those programs, up 235 percent from 60,000 in 2011.
Apple’s transparency definitely improved over the course of 2012 when it comes to its efforts around supplier responsibility and maintaining healthy and safe work environments, and that’s something Apple CEO Tim Cook clearly undertook as a conscious effort. That’s not to say that Apple didn’t have its fair share of labor issues during the year (issues around the demanding requirements for building the iPhone 5 come to mind), but especially in the way that Apple has allowed disinterested third parties to come in and aid with its monitoring efforts, 2012 was definitely the most significant year yet in terms of improvements made to its stance on supplier responsibility.

543,The Bonsai Is A Shaving Accessory That Hopes To Be One Designer’s Contribution To Water Conservation,https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/03/the-bonsai-is-a-shaving-accessory-that-hopes-to-be-one-designers-contribution-to-water-conservation/,2013/01/03,"
The Bonsai is gadget with a soul, one that hopes to make a global difference by changing the way we go about an activity many do on a daily basis. It’s a shaving accessory, and it’s being funded via Indiegogo right now, with creator Craig Battin and his team looking for $125,000 to turn their final prototype into a production shipping device.
The Bonsai is a razor rinsing device, one that can save up to 99 percent of the water the average person uses rinsing out their blade under a running tap. It’s essentially a cup, one that you fill with a set amount of water at the beginning of your shave, which then creates a spray via high-pressure circulation of water. It also filters out hair and other debris, which you can then dump when you’re done.
Battin explained via email that growing up in Las Vegas, the need to conserve water was ever-present, hence his fascination with this problem in particular.
“I can remember driving over Hoover Dam with my family on the way to Arizona and seeing the “bathtub ring” of Lake Mead grow and grow, and it was very alarming to me,” he explained. ” At the most severe point in the ongoing drought, I believe the lake level had dropped by 120 feet.  When I joined the workforce after college, I was forced to shave frequently, and I was always bothered by how much water I wasted each day. That was the genesis.”
While the water conservation aspect drove the Bonsai’s initial development, Battin and his team quickly turned their attention to other areas of concern. These prompted the design of the filter to get rid of gunk that can clog drains, especially with daily shaving, and also the way the Bonsai actually blends your shaving cream with the rinse water as you go to create a solution that’s easier on your face since it’s oiling your razor as you go. The project will also offer an oil that you can use in combination with the Bonzai to enhance that effect. Battin explained that too much attention has been focused on razors, hence the lack of forward movement in terms of changes to the way we actually shave.
“It seems like we’ve been riding this trajectory where the only feasible innovations involve the physical razor or the blades, so you end up with things like vibrating handles and lethal 6-blade cartridges,” he said. “I think the lack of disruption has everything to do with where the focus has been, and the fact that consumers really don’t have many alternatives.”
Of course, the Bonzai also saves money by saving water, and Battin claims, by extending the life of your razor blades. It’s powered by a rechargeable battery and works both in and out of the shower. The gadget is available during the Indiegogo campaign for a pledge starting at $79, and the team estimates they’ll begin shipping devices by July 2013. If you’re a slave to the shave, as most of us likely are, you could do worse than to back this project and its aspirational goal of cutting down on the environmental toll it takes for us to clean up our ape-like faces and bodies.

544,Apple Exploring Alternative Wind Power Technology And Motion-Control Mac Mice,https://techcrunch.com/2012/12/27/apple-exploring-alternative-wind-power-technology-and-motion-control-mac-mice/,2012/12/27,"
Apple’s patent filings today reveal one concept outside their usual product-focused applications, detailing a method for harnessing wind power in a manner different from that employed in traditional turbines. Electricity gathered from a wind turbine would be converted to heat energy and stored in a “low-heat capacity fluid” in Apple’s patent, allowing it to be tapped on an as-needed basis whenever the wind dies down.
It all gets pretty technical, but painted in broad strokes, the system would potentially use the motion of the rotor shaft moving against a “low-heat capacity fluid” (such as ethanol or mercury, for instance) to generate heat through friction between the two surfaces. This can then be transferred from the storage fluid to a working fluid which is then boiled off to release steam. The steam powers a turbine, converting the energy to usable form.
Apple’s system differs from basic wind-power generators that are highly subject to variances in wind power, as well as systems that use batteries to store energy made through rotational energy for later use when wind isn’t actively making that much power. Instead, it is designed to make wind power available on a more “on-demand” basis, which is of significant importance for facilities requiring a constant, uninterrupted power supply. That likely explains why Apple is pursuing this kind of tech: Its massive data centers have huge power requirements, and the company has stated its commitment to harnessing wind, solar and other alternative energy sources to help keep these facilities running smoothly.
So far, Apple has been working mostly on building solar farms and biogas generators to help fulfill its energy needs at data center locations like the one it has in Maiden, NC, and competitor Google recently revealed that it has powered a data center with wind power for the first time.
In a second filing published today, Apple is back on track with its more consumer-oriented patents, this time detailing an evolution of the mouse that would bring more gesture controls to the input device. The additions would allow a mouse to detect tilting, tilt-sliding, lifting and other gestures to add additional command capabilities to the mouse’s basic clicking, movement and scrolling. It’s sort of a Wii Remote-lite, which is likely an easier control paradigm for traditional desktop computer users to adopt than anything more drastic.
This is interesting is because Apple is still showing an interest in iterating on its input device design, which still requires a lot of improvement. The Magic Mouse, while promising with its multitouch surface, is in practice a frustrating device to use. Apple traditionally hasn’t done great with mice, and it’ll be interesting to see if it can do any better while adding motion control into the mix, if this patent ever turns into a shipping product.

545,"The Electree+, A Solar-Powered, Induction Charging Bonsai Tree Hits Kickstarter",https://techcrunch.com/2012/11/22/the-electree-a-solar-powered-induction-charging-bonsai-tree-hits-kickstarter/,2012/11/22,"
Induction charging seems ready for its time in the spotlight, with the Nexus 4, Droid DNA and Lumia 920 all shipping with wireless charging based on the Qi standard built-in. Now a concept design that offers solar-powered wireless charging cleverly hidden inside a futuristic looking bonsai tree hopes to become a reality with the help of Kickstarter.
The electree+ began life as a concept by French designer Vivien Muller, which he originally unveiled in 2008. Then, three years later, Muller tried to bring the device to market, kicking off pre-orders for the device beginning at $370. She was aiming for 400 pre-sales, but the device eventually shipped to just a small group of 200 pre-order customers.
Now, the electree+ has been redesigned to maximize its solar efficiency, and to be manufactured in the USA at much larger volume, and for less money. The redesigned electree+ boasts a 14,000mAh internal battery, which when fully charged can fill an iPhone 5 up to and over nine times. It features 27 solar panels at the tips of branches, which are adjustable to capture maximum light. It requires 36 hours in sunlight to build up a full charge, but it also only needs around 4 hours to build up enough juice to fully recharge your standard smartphone.
Other features, like an optional built-in- NFC chip, mean that it can trigger an action when a smartphone is placed on its surface, in order to put it into dock mood or manage smart home connected devices, like light fixtures and curtains. It also has changeable faceplates, if you’re feeling bored by a particular color. Plus, the electree+ is environmentally friendly, since it’s just sipping sunlight to deliver charges to your devices.
The electree+ has two USB ports, including one designed for devices with lower power requirements like smartphones, and one for tablets which feature faster charging powers. As mentioned, because it uses Qi, it’ll work out of the box with the Nexus 4 and other smartphones with Qi inductive charging coils built-in, but it should also work with iPhones so long as they have a wireless charging case.
Pre-orders begin at $199, depending on what kind of options you want, and the team behind the redesigned electree+ wants to hit at least 1,000 pre-sales, or a total funding amount of $200,000 in order to go to production. It’s an ambitious project, but unlike with a lot of products on Kickstarter, this is one that’s actually been made and shipped, so hopefully the team stands a better chance than most of hitting their May 2013 target ship date.

Google just announced that it has invested $75 million in a 50 MW wind farm in Rippey, Iowa, a small town an hour outside of Des Moines. This is Google’s second wind energy investment in the state. In 2010, Google entered a long-term contract to buy green energy for its Iowa data center, but this is the company’s first direct investment into an Iowa wind project.
The wind farm, Google notes, is already in operation and has been contracted to sell all of its energy to the Central Iowa Power Cooperative, which will use it to provide electricity to about 15,000 homes. It looks like none of this electricity will be used for Google’s local data center.
With this investment, Google has brought its total committed investment into green energy projects to just over $990 million. The company’s other wind energy investments include a $157 million investment in a Southern California wind energy farm and a $100 million investment into a wind farm in Oregon that is anticipated to be the world’s largest at 845 MW. Google’s first wind energy investment was worth $38.8 million and involved two North Dakota wind farms. Besides the wind farms themselves, Google also owns a 37.5 percent stake in the Atlantic Wind Connection backbone, a project that aims to build transmission lines for green energy along the mid-Atlantic coast.

547,Retina MacBook Pro Found To Meet EPEAT Standards Thanks To External Upgradeability Options,https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/15/retina-macbook-pro-found-to-meet-epeat-standards-thanks-to-external-upgradeability-options/,2012/10/15,"
When Apple introduced the Retina MacBook Pro and new MacBook Airs in June, it also quietly noted it would be withdrawing its computers from voluntary EPEAT environmental standards qualification. That provoked a minor customer furor, with some government agencies in particular saying they might not be able to continue sourcing notebooks from Apple, and the company promptly rejoined the program. But questions of whether the new MacBook Pro in particular could meet the EPEAT standards, which include a provision for products being able to be “upgradeable with commonly available tools” still hung in the air, until a new rule change.
The EPEAT organization has verified the MacBook Pro, Air and a number of other new unibody laptops from Lenovo, Samsung and Toshiba, based in part on the wide availability of external hardware like HDs and optical drives that can be added via USB and other I/O ports like Thunderbolt. Once upon a time, the “upgradeable” rule was taken to mean things like expandable memory, easily replaced internal components like HDs and batteries, but the shift in definition (which EPEAT calls a “clarification”) reflects a shift in the manufacturing trends of notebooks and all-in-ones, and also, it’s definitely true that higher speed I/O (USB 3.0, Thunderbolt) makes it possible to do much more with external accessories today than in the past.
The organization also had concerns around ease of disassembly, an important point for making notebooks easy to recycle and for increasing their longevity with users via things like battery replacement. Provided with instructions from manufacturers, however, EPEAT found its lab could take the laptops apart in 20 minutes at the outside, and take batteries out in three minutes max. That’s apparently even true of Apple’s glued-down MacBook Air batteries, so the company’s ultraportable gets a pass and retains a certification that makes it much easier sell to government and NGOs who look to EPEAT compliance as a way of showing off a green-minded organizational ethos.
Not everyone is pleased with the outcome, however, as Greenpeace has spoken out about the change to the assessment standards in a statement from the organization. Greenpeace’s Casey Harrell said in that statement that essentially, the process involved to replace the batteries is by no means accessible to the average user, and doesn’t reflect real-world experience since it also means voiding the warranty if a user tried to replace the battery on their own. Harrell included the following in the statement:
Is it a coincidence? It’s unclear why EPEAT caved in, but the impact is that EPEAT has confused consumers and businesses who want to buy green electronics that can be repaired and will last a long time, and sets a dangerous trend for the burgeoning market of ultrabooks.
Apple isn’t the only company floating smaller, thinner unibody laptops as the future of portable computing, but it does appear to be the one doing so with the most success, so while Greenpeace has a tradition of calling out Apple on its environmental gaffes, this time the allegations are likely laid at the feet of the right target.

Editor’s note: Sal Cangeloso is the editor of Geek.com and wrote a new book on an odd topic. It’s called LED Lighting: A Primer to Lighting the Future and it focuses on the upcoming explosion in LED manufacturing, offering a basic understanding of the technology and an interesting look at the history of LED lights.
You can buy LED Lighting: A Primer to Lighting the Future here and the first three commenters below get a copy of the book. Here is an excerpt from the first chapter of the book discussing the growth of lighting from old-timey incandescents to modern LED technology.
The incandescent bulb is a good place to start with any talk about lighting. This design has had tremendous longevity (over 130 years) and it makes for a cheap, versatile bulb. Unfortunately, this design is also power-hungry, inefficient, short-lived (with some exceptions), and fragile. They produce a minimum amount of lumens-per-watt, though they’ve made appreciable gains over the years, and are highly sensitive to power conditions. For example, a 5% reduction in voltage could double the life of a bulb while only decreasing light output by 20%.
One of the most notable strengths of the incandescent is the quality of the light it provides. This isn’t as easy to define as some of the other characteristics that will be covered, but it’s an important one when it comes to consumer adoption. After all, it’s nice to try to sell people on longevity and power savings, but if they think that the new bulbs are ugly or are too different from what they know, you’ll find them hoarding 75W and 100W incandescents before such bulbs are removed from the shelves.
Quality of light means that in order for people to be comfortable with the light these bulbs provide, the bulbs will need a color temperature that they find to be in an acceptable range, a high degree of color accuracy (usually measured by CRI), and a usable light pattern, to name a few qualities. The bigger point, as any early CFL or LED bulb buyer could tell you, is that if the bulbs don’t produce attractive light that people are comfortable being around, it won’t matter how long they last or how little power they consume.
Incandescents have good qualities, but ultimately their inefficiency means they are not a viable solution moving forward. Even modern incandescents can turn about 90% of the energy they take in into heat, which is obviously wasteful and inefficient in the extreme. Physicists might argue that this isn’t wasteful at all, and you might enjoy the heat they provide, but most of us want to leave the lighting to the lights and the heating to our furnaces. Before we demonize the long-standing bulb design, it’s worth noting that there is such a thing as efficient incandescence. While these are in fact more efficient versions of the incandescent bulb, they are still not at the level of top CFLs and LEDs. In fact, GE was working on a high-efficiency incandescent (HEI) for about 18 months, but gave up on it in order to focus its efforts on LED and organic LED (OLED) bulbs. HEIs were said to produce about 30 lm/W with the ultimate goal of doubling that amount.The halogen lamp is a type of incandescent that operates hotter and lasts longer, but its efficiency gains are minimal.
The much-maligned CFL solves some of the efficiency problems of incandescent bulbs, usually producing around 50 lm/W. Unfortunately, each bulb contains a small amount of mercury (about 4 milligrams per bulb), so disposal can be a problem, especially if the thin, usually helical, glass breaks. The bulbs have reasonably long lives, usually rated for 5,000 to 15,000 hours—but they don’t last nearly that long if they are used in short time spans as rapid cycling is bad for the bulbs. That means a CFL in a bathroom or closet might not last much longer than an incandescent bulb, despite what it says on the package. In fact, a CFL that runs for an average of 15 minutes at a time might last just 40% of its rated lifespan. Alternatively, a CFL that is used continuously from the first time it was turned on might last close to twice its expected lifespan.
CFLs saw a big jump in marketshare in 2007, capturing around23% of the market, but have been in decline over the last year or so, despite the bulbs being widely available, affordable to purchase, and much cheaper to operate than incandescents. Part of this is due to an increasing number of consumers learning about the CFL’s use of mercury, but current economic conditions also indicate that people have simply been looking for a more affordable option. In that respect, incandescents still cannot be beat.
One of the most important characteristics of LED lighting is that they are solid-state. “Solid-state” might be a term we normally associate with computer parts (as in the solid-state drive) but it’s not something the casual LED buyer will ever consider. The concept is quite simple: rather than generating light through burning or gas-discharge, LEDs use semiconductors. The is the most fundamental and important distinction that determines why LED lights have their unique characteristics and will be able to have such an impact on the lighting market. As seen in other industries, semiconductors improve at an exponential rate and have a way of taking over wherever they are used. Lighting should prove to be no different.
Of course, LEDs are just one type of solid-state lighting; there are also organic LEDs (OLEDs) and polymer LEDs (PLEDs). Right now, the LED is the main focus of SSL adoption and its future looks quite promising, thanks to the efficiency gains it brings to the market. OLEDs and their carbon-based semiconductors have potential, but high costs mean they won’t be a viable option as soon as standard LEDs.
The advent of solid-state lighting doesn’t just mean more efficiency. Just as with the introduction of high technology to other parts of our lives—from our phones, to our mail, to our televisions—light is now high-tech. In this case, it’s not the tech that makes the difference, it’s that this latest step means our lights could soon be gadgets. Today’s technology brings with it intelligence and connectivity, which makes way for lights that can be tracked, controlled remotely, and designed to work with other devices. While the humble incandescent was just a conduit for electricity and output both light and heat, a modern-day bulb can be and do much more.
What does this all mean for the LED lamp? Basically, the time is ripe for growth. LED adoption is low at the moment, but not because purchasing one won’t pay off. An LED bulb will pay for itself many times over thanks to its energy savings, but the high initial cost is just too much of a hurdle for many businesses and is unpalatable for even more consumers. As prices drop we’ll see a dramatic growth, just as CFLs grew when it was clear that they could lead to long-term savings and could, in fact, provide acceptable light for our kitchens and living rooms, not just offices.

549,Charger Not Included: U.K. Carrier O2 To Sell HTC Phone With USB Cable But No Plug,https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/26/charger-not-included-u-k-carrier-o2-to-sell-htc-phone-with-usb-cable-but-no-plug/,2012/09/26,"
Peer into the drawers of the average gadget addict and you’re sure to find a tangled mess of unused chargers gathering dust. Mobile phones are a prime offender in creating redundant gadget junk, with new models released every few months to drive upgrades. Indeed, U.K. carrier O2 calculates there are now more than 100 million unused phone chargers languishing in Brits’ drawers — which is why it says it’s decided to sell a smartphone without a charger in the box.
“The environmental cost of multiple and redundant chargers is enormous and I believe that, as the mobile phone has become more prevalent, we as retailers and manufacturers have an ever-greater responsibility to be a more sustainable industry,” said O2 UK CEO Ronan Dunne in a statement.
O2 reckons the time is right to introduce a charger-less phone because the majority of phone sales are upgrades — rather than people buying their very first mobile phone.
It also notes that wide adoption of USB within phones means most chargers are interchangeable. Even Sony has stopped making crazy proprietary chargers. (Apple, of course, has not.) The European Commission’s push to create a universal phone charger standard has been the underlying driving force behind charger compatibility over the past few years. The rise of Google’s Android platform has also helped push Micro USB ports into more and more handsets.
The charger-less phone heading for O2’s shelves will be made by HTC. It will include a Micro USB port and will also come with a Micro-USB to USB cable in the box — presumably to ensure the select few phone buyers who don’t actually have a compatible charger lying around at home could still juice it up by plugging the cable into their computer.
There are no further details on the specs of the phone as yet — O2 says it will be releasing more details over the coming weeks.
The carrier added it wants to sell “more and more” phones without chargers in future, and said it’s also hopeful other mobile companies will follow its (charger-less) lead.

550,Smart Money For Smartphone-Controlled Smart Homes: TechStars Alum Mobiplug Gets $2.7M Led By Foundry Group,https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/25/smart-money-for-smartphone-controlled-smart-homes-mobiplug-gets-2-7m-led-by-foundry-group/,2012/09/25,"
That was fast: Mobiplug Networks, a startup focusing on smartphone-controlled smart home technology, which was featured only in August as part of TechStars’ most recent class in Boulder, Colorado, has today announced a new CEO and news that it has picked up $2.7 million Series A round of funding, led by Boulder-based VC Foundry Group. Bullet Time Ventures, SK Ventures, Social Leverage, Clarion Direct Investment are among the other strategic investors, the company noted today in a statement. Its new CEO, meanwhile, is Tim Enwall — a serial entrepreneur who was most recently the CEO of Tendril, a company working in the adjacent area of energy consumption metrics.
Prior to this, Mobiplug had received $118,000 in funding as part of the TechStars program, $18,000 in seed funding and an additional $100,000 convertible debt note.
Earlier this month, Foundry Group announced that it had raised a third fund of $225 million for investing in early-stage tech startups based in North America. Some of its past investments include Zynga, Jiraffe, Awe.sm and Modular Robots, among many others.
Mobiplug has created a single box that behaves like a home hub that can automatically link up all WiFi-enabled appliances and electronics in your home — these can include a thermostat, door locks, lights, TVs, garage doors, and home security systems. Through a smartphone app, users can then control these devices from wherever they are. This is not a totally new technology — given that Xfinity, ADT and others also provide similar services. Where it is disruptive is in how it integrates all WiFi-enabled devices — no matter the protocol or make — and doesn’t require users to sign on to expensive contracts for the service.
Linking up a fragmented landscape of WiFi devices in a single system has been one of the gating factors in the growth of smart home technology, says Enwall. “Getting wirelessly-enabled household items like locks, thermostats, lights, outlets and shades made by different manufacturers and based on different protocols to talk to each other is an enormous problem to solve, which is keeping this market from exploding. We’re fixing that.” he said in a statement.
While many users out there are may not be as WiFi connected as they can be, with wireless controls becoming increasingly common, the product will also become increasingly relevant. Solutions like this one are likely to become more common also as more people become conscientious of how to better manage their own electricity usage.
As part of the investment, Foundry Group’s Ryan McIntyre is joining the board of directors for Mobiplug. He had been a mentor for Mobiplug during TechStars, and says that Enwall’s appointment was one reason why he feels Mobiplug means business.
“I was really impressed by the co-founders and their ability to solve the thorny technical and interoperability problems that are currently holding back the home monitoring and control and Internet of Things (IoT) industry from mass adoption,” he said in a statement. “And when Tim Enwall decided to join Mobiplug, we felt confident that the addition of his experience and leadership to this already talented core team could really disrupt the market and lead this growing space.”
In addition to being the CEO of Tendril, Enwall, according to his LinkedIn profile, has been a principal at Comstock Ventures, and has also founded, built up and sold a consultancy to Gartner.
The company will be using the investment to continue business development and to staff up. Areas where Mobiplug are looking to hire include mobile development (iOS and Android), mobile UX, mobile UI, cloud platform, and wireless protocol and embedded Linux engineering.

551,LIFX Is A Smartphone-Controlled Lightbulb,https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/17/lifx-is-a-smartphone-controlled-lightbulb/,2012/09/17,"
Just when you thought it was safe to ignore the app economy, we have the LIFX, a Kickstarter-funded lightbulb you control from your iOS or Android device. Why, you ask? Because it’s a lightbulb controlled via smartphone, that’s why.
The product is just one day old on Kickstarter, and it already hit the $283,394 mark which means it’s definitely getting funded. The bulb itself costs $69.
What does it do and why do you need a smartphone? Well, first you can change the brightness and color of the bulb right from your phone. You can also set it to go on and off at a certain time and come on when you get home.

Because it’s a self-contained unit you don’t need to change your wiring. Just twist the old fellow in and fire up the app to enjoy endless color combinations and feel like you’re in a disco.
Here’s what it does:
Control your lights from anywhere
Choose any brightness for a specific bulb, a room or your whole house
Create the colors to match any mood or decor
Get notifications such as Twitter, Facebook, Texts and more
Reduce your energy consumption and save money
Visualise your music with animated colors
Make an impression at your next dinner party
Get creative with colors and effects
Create a night light for your kids
Security mode when you’re on holidays
Create groups of lights
Robot dance like it’s 1999
Sadly the product isn’t shipping until March 2013 but it’s pretty cool, especially the music dance party part. I’m getting one so we can turn our bedroom into an adventure under the sea by twisting the knob over to blue then to white and then to dark red. The dark red is when the sharks come.

553,Spinlister Makes It Into Disrupt Battlefield With Its ‘Airbnb For Bikes’,https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/spinlister-makes-it-into-disrupt-battlefield-with-its-airbnb-for-bikes/,2012/09/11,"
Peer-to-peer bike rental service Spinlister was chosen by the audience from amongst the Startup Alley companies today to pitch on stage as part of the TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield in San Francisco this week.
There are over 100 million bikes in the US and over a billion on the planet. But most bikes are not used daily, meaning there’s plenty of opportunity to meet demand. Normal bike rental from a store costs about $16 a day. On Spinlister you can rent a bike from $5 a day up to about $100 for a really nice bike. They are now in 275 cities in 40 countries with over 2,000 bikes listed.
Founded in May 2011, Spinlister is a peer-to-peer bike rental company allowing people to rent a bike online, either from other individuals or existing bike rental shops. It’s like an Airbnb for bikes. Pretty handy if you’re a tourist in a city. However it obviously needs lots of people to participate. So far it’s launched in San Francisco and New York but it announced on stage at Disrupt that it’s prepping a national launch this Fall and a new mobile app is in the works. International plans are also on the way. 

Although it’s only being available in those two cities, back in May it managed to garner about 400 and over 2,000 from bike rental shops. Plus it’s reached bike renters in six continents globally. 
In the first six weeks after its launch about 25 percent of listers completed a rental, and of those, about 25 percent did multiple rentals. That means those users make an average of $50 each renting out their bike. The more popular your bike the more rents you get, with some people making up to $100 a week. Spinlister also now offers a guarantee which insures your bike for up to $5,000, which helps with traction obviously.
The next stage is to decrease fulfillment times by getting renters and listers interacting.
So far Spinlister has raised $225,000 in seed funding from Angels.
Judges asked why the company did not start with mobile, but the team said the small team of three had come from a Web background and were now adding a mobile engineer to develop the mobile side. The team is also looking a ‘recreational enthusiasts’.

554,Urjanet Raises $4M Series B To Deliver Big Data Energy Insights For Enterprise,https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/07/urjanet-raises-4m-series-b-to-deliver-big-data-energy-insights-for-enterprise/,2012/09/07,"
Atlanta-based Urjanet announced today that it has closed a $4 million Series B round of funding, two years after its initial launch. The company provides energy data for heavy energy consumers, mostly in the form of enterprise customers, to help them to make better business decisions around current energy use, look at how future projects will impact energy expenditure, and see the return on investment being generated by their existing energy spend. The new funding comes from Grotech Ventures, as well as existing investors GRA Venture Fund, LLC and Imlay Investments Inc.
Energy consumption is an area of growing concern, since older methods of measuring energy use like reading the meter or checking your monthly bill after the fact have been replace with sophisticated, real-time data streams that can tell you exactly how much you’re using, and exactly where. Urjanet’s SaaS offering hooks into their existing software, including energy monitoring tools as well as business intelligence platforms like Salesforce and accounting systems, and then uses all of its information as well as outside sources detailing regional pricing, consumption rates, taxes and more to deliver insights to businesses looking for ways to be smarter about things like carbon footprint, or to move high-consumption facilities to places where local tax breaks make energy costs cheaper, for example.
“You can kind of think of us as the Bloomberg of energy data,” Urjanet CEO Sanjoy Malik explained in an interview. “We’re connected through our cloud-based platform to over 600 different utilities, and that utility footprint is expanding very, very quickly.” This is a growing need, according to Malik, first because energy is gaining more prominence in the corporate balance sheet as costs rise (two of Urjanet’s customers spend over $1 billion on energy annually, for instance), and also because businesses are becoming more interested in measuring their carbon footprint.
Carbon footprint is important to businesses now more than ever for a number of reasons; it’s an key measure of sustainability, something stakeholders of all stripes are increasingly paying attention to, and it can be important to customers interested in the reputation of a business, as well as NGOs who could represent a considerable headache if that aspect of the business isn’t well-managed. As energy providers become increasingly deregulated, too, and able to compete on price, the need of a clear picture of where spend is going becomes clear.
Urjanet’s new funding will help it grow its reach via sales and marketing, and also make new additions to its infrastructure, according to Malik. As for competition, Malik says that the overwhelming one is still bill payment vendors, who help with the complicated task of payment of bills at large scale but aren’t taking the kind of comprehensive look that Urjanet can provide. Overall, he says that few are working on delivering this as an actual data service, but other young companies like Gridium are looking to get into the space soon, so it could become a lot more crowded relatively quickly.

555,Open Compute Project: Can Facebook Help Save The World?,https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/31/open-compute-project-can-facebook-help-save-the-world/,2012/08/31,"
Hardware generally doesn’t interest me too much, so when I heard about the Open Compute project I didn’t give it too much attention. Casually reading up on the subject a little more left me even less interested. Why should Facebook have to design their own hardware, I wondered? Wouldn’t hardware vendors be clambering over each other to supply Facebook with gobs and gobs of servers for their data centers?
Amir Michael, Facebook’s hardware lead, discussed the Open Compute project in a keynote presentation at LinuxCon. He laid out the root problem: hardware manufacturers, in an effort to provide differentiation, were actually creating more problems than they were solving. The on-system instrumentation that OEMs provided for Facebook created additional complexity, and ultimately wasted space and produced unnecessary heating concerns.
The HPs and Dells and IBMs of the world had established a very successful business for themselves selling servers with their own customizations, and in smaller quantities those customizations did provide some modicum of benefit to their customers. When you’re buying several hundred servers from a single manufacturer, that manufacturer’s management tools are easy to consume.
But when you’re buying several thousand servers at a time from multiple vendors, the different management tools simply get in the way. The differences between chassis designs and motherboard layouts complicate service issues for the data center staff.
Facebook made the remarkable decision to solve this problem for themselves. They designed their own power supply, which reached 95% efficiency. They designed a vanity free server case, which provided easier access for technicians. This resulted in an unexpected benefit for heat dissipation. They went on to design a motherboard with no cruft: just the absolute essentials for the computing requirements. This mainboard was cheaper to produce, and also shared improved thermal properties. And finally, Facebook redesigned the venerable server rack to make it substantially easier to access, move, and deploy.
An important, but oft-overlooked ancillary benefit to Facebook’s vanity-free and minimalist designs is that they involve less waste, both in the production process but also in the disposal process. When you’re buying thousands of servers, this becomes a very important ecological issue. Computer waste is a serious environmental concern, and too many consumers of technology ignore the consequences of disposal.
Recognizing that their data center headaches couldn’t possibly be unique, Facebook shared all of their design specifications, CAD drawings, and reference materials under open licenses to their newly formed Open Compute Project.
The reason for this decision, as Michael said in his presentation, is that “openness always wins.” He pointed to the advent of the USB standard as the perfect illustration of this point. Prior to USB, the PC industry was plagued with finnicky peripherals and an abundance of sub-standard interface options. USB, developed openly and in collaboration with multiple interested parties, reshaped the peripheral market into what we enjoy today.
My first question to Michael was “Why didn’t the market solve this problem?” Specifically, why didn’t any of Facebook’s hardware vendors recognize the problem and address it. He pointed out that the bulk of the work began in 2009, when Facebook was considerably smaller than it is today. None of Facebook’s vendors really saw the scale to which Facebook could grow, and as such didn’t see a need to change their products in any meaningful way. The notion of “scale out deployments” hadn’t quite hit the mainstream.
Michael shared with me that all of their internally developed specifications are shared with multiple vendors, and manufacturing proposals are reviewed internally through a democratic process. Each proposal is analyzed according to a number of factors.
When a hardware design is approved for manufacturing, Facebook always uses two vendors for production. The end result is two identical products from two discrete vendors; but this results in supply-chain diversity and improved product continuity: both of which are important factors when dealing with production runs at the scale Facebook demands.
Michael pointed out that all of the benefits of scale out development — power, cooling, ease of access — benefit small and medium business consumers just as much as enormous data centers. He also shared that the response to the Open Compute project was unexpected. The reference designs were adopted by participants in a number of different markets and tweaked to provide the kinds of benefits needed in those markets.
Historically, large scale providers have been cagey talking about the details of their infrastructure. As a result of the Open Compute project, more and more organizations are growing comfortable talking about the specifics of their data centers. This is slowly resulting in better design and implementation decisions, which will in the long run be better for the environment.
Say what you will about Facebook’s business and marketing decisions, but you can’t argue that they’re doing the world a favor by reducing waste in computer manufacturing designs. The issues involved will only get more important as more and more technology is manufactured. The Open Compute project is a great start. We need more involvement in things like this. We also need to make sure that we’re adequately dealing — as an industry — with the proper disposal of end-of-life hardware.

Professor Keon Jae Lee at the Korean Advanced Institute Of Science And Technology created a solid-state flexible battery that retains is energy level when folded, spindled, and or mildly mutilated. The battery could mean future ereaders and tablets could be paper thin and partially foldable, ushering in interesting new device designs.
These rechargeable lithium-ion batteries are actually printed on a thin film. Applying battery material to rollable displays has been a big problem for the gadget manufacturers thus far but this breakthrough could change the way we think about surfaces, screens, and case materials.
As you can see from the video, the thin film battery can be bent over and over again without reducing voltage output. Professor Lee expects this technology to be part of “next-generation fully flexible electronic systems” but there was no discussion of potential commercial adoption. I guess we’ll just have to wait for our EZ Roll Soft-Style iPods for another few years.

Our week in the Southeast gave us plenty of memorable moments, but perhaps my favorite of the entire trip was when I stumbled upon the Elf — a pedal-solar electric hybrid vehicle from Organic Transit in Durham, NC. It’s one of those products that — given the right financing and marketing — could be completely disruptive in Urban areas.
The vehicles come in two models currently, The Elf which can hold up to 150lbs, and the TruckIt, which can handle an 800lb payload. Both have solar charged batteries that can last for 30 miles before switching to pedaling mode, and they have turn signals, brake lights and front headlights. They even have side mirrors.
I stole away Rob Cotter, CEO at Organic Transit, to tell us a little more about what I like to call “sunbikes.” He said that Organic Transit vehicles can go anywhere a bike can go (like a bike lane, or bike trail) and “depending on what state you’re in” you can go about 30 mph. The Elf weighs 95 lbs and gets the equivalent of 1,800 miles per gallon.
For insurance purposes, I wasn’t allowed to use the throttle on a prototype, but even pedaling that bad boy around was a pleasure. So if you’re interested, head over to Organic Transit’s website and pre-order. Even at $3,900 for the Elf, Cotter reports over 340 orders so far.

558,Department Of Veterans Affairs Uses SaaS To Go Green,https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/11/va-goes-green-with-sparc520/,2012/07/11,"
Defining an energy efficiency strategy can be challenging for big organizations with multiple large buildings. The Department of Veterans Affairs announced today that it has installed energy analysis SPARC520 equipment for its Washington, D.C. headquarters. 
SPARC, based in Charleston, South Carolina, has a diverse portfolio of products that includes human resources tools for employee engagement and interviewing optimization, as well as an open source private app store solution. Its SPARC520 product, named after the light spectrum wavelength at which the human eye sees green, provides real-time energy usage data monitoring, analysis and forecasting. The company employs close to 200 people, most of whom are software engineers. 

“Our goal as a company is to use our talents as software product developers to solve things that suck,” said CEO Eric Bowman. 
At the VA’s 11-floor headquarters, SPARC520 installed 107 clamp devices that monitor the building’s electricity, water and natural gas usage. Each clamp goes over the top of a wire to measure flow-through and has 27 data collection points, providing a total of 2,889 data collection points throughout the building. This data is fed to SPARC520’s analytics platform, where real-time energy usage can be viewed on the web or on an iOS device. 

In addition to real-time data, SPARC520 offers forecasting based on current and historical data, mapping out various scenarios that make it clear which adjustments will have the greatest energy-saving impact. 
There’s also an element of gamification built in, allowing employees to compete against each other to reduce energy usage. When SPARC implemented this in their own building, they saw energy costs decrease by 75%, Bowman said.

President Barack Obama is famous for his affinity for his BlackBerry and science fairs, but the tech love goes a lot further than that. Todd Park, the U.S. chief technology officer, today described the President as having a “very high geek quotient” with a “go go go” attitude when it comes to new tech initiatives — which, yes, he likes in and of themselves, but more importantly as a means to an end.
The comments were made during a fireside chat at TC Disrupt in New York, where Park along with U.S. CIO Steven VanRoekel also announced the government’s big plans for opening up its data and courting developers.
“He is focused on how technology and data help you get the right healthcare for your family, pick the right college for your kid, help keep your kid safe, make the best decisions on save energy bill,” said Park. “It’s tech as a means to an end.”
At the sidelines of the stage, Park told me that when he and VanRoekel proposed the whole idea of open data to the President, he got very fired up and wanted to act fast. “He loved it. The first thing he said to us was ‘Go, go, go!'” he said.
But, yes, he is a bit of a geek, even still. On the subject of Obama and science fairs: “He hangs out five times as long as needed.”
VanRoekel noted also that how technology is an important factor in how people should conceive of economic recovery going forward. “When you look at U.S. history, the majority of Fortune 500 companies were founded in bad economic times,” he said, and at the same time they have been marked by “inflection points” in technology that helped to catapult these companies forward. “We have an opportunity to seize that [model] again,” he said.
As for the government itself, there is a general sense of risk aversion prevalent among of public servants when it comes to technology, VanRoekel admitted. That will play out especially with the proposed Data Act, which will put a lot of requirements on public servants. The two are trying to stem the possible tide of dissent early on with this: “I want to have conversations with Congress right now,” said VanRoekel, who wants to know: “What is the burden put on federal agencies in this process?”
But Park added, “If you can figure out a way to release their mojo, they can do amazing things.”
An interesting connection that he drew here was that public servants, by definition, are not motivated by money — something he said that he noticed characterized the best entrepreneurs when he was still in the private sector (he had a long carrer as a consultant at Booz Allen and also in health tech):
“When I was in the private sector one characteristic that differentiated the best entrepreneurs from the others was that they were not in it for the stock options but for a mission, to deliver something that was helpful… Every entrepreneurial journey it turns out is like this.”

560,Evive Launches With $2M From Angels To Help Cure Our Addiction To Bottled Water,https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/03/evive-launch/,2012/05/03,"
While we all need water to survive, colleges and universities across the U.S. are betting that their students can survive without water of the bottled variety. As Bloomberg recently reported, more than 90 universities, including Brown and Harvard, are banning or restricting the sale of plastic water bottles. Considering that bottled water represents a $22 billion industry in the U.S. and that more than 9 billion gallons were sold last year, the actions of these universities aren’t likely to scare “Big Water,” as they represent just a fraction of sales. But it makes an important statement about bottled water nonetheless.
And let’s be honest: Whether or not you’ve recently hugged a tree, buying branded tap water in a plastic bottle for $1.50+ a pop seems … well … completely #$%^&-ing ridiculous — unless of course your village has yet to secure a reliable source of potable water. In that case, we understand. But, with colleges (and apparently Concord, Massachusetts) moving to or actually banning bottled water, a Pennsylvania-based startup, called Evive Station, has developed an innovative, ergonomic solution for providing campuses (and beyond) with a better alternative.
Like cellphone recycling startup, ecoATM, Evive has decided to go with the kiosk approach to the bottled water problem. With design help from Daedalus, the startup developed its “stations” to provide campuses with the world’s first on-site bottle cleaning and filtered water-dispensing service.
That doesn’t sound that cool, says the 16-year-old cynic in you. And you’re right, plenty of universities and organizations provide what are known as “sinks” and “dishwashers” and “hydration stations” often called “water fountains.” Fair enough. But even if you buy a plastic water bottle and use it once, it can get filthy pretty quickly, and sticking it in the dishwasher isn’t a workable solution.
 So, what’s cool about Evive is that they offer users double-walled stainless steel reusable bottles, which means no more plastic, and lower carbon footprints. In turn, their kiosks filter municipal water, offer unlimited re-filling and cleaning of those steel bottles by way of a patent-pending process that only takes a minute. And everything other than the bottles are free.
The stations are also designed to dispense bag-in-box concentrated, flavored water drinks, hot beverages, and multivitamin options, so that pale, sickly looking college students that haven’t seen the light of day as they cram for exams can get their daily dose of vitamins.
But, seeing as the service is free, that Evive is offering to install these stations on campuses for free, and is sweetening the deal with something called the “Precycling Grant” — which essentially means that the more students use the station, the more Evive gives back to the university — you might wonder whether this is purely mission-driven or whether Evive actually has a business model. And that’s where it gets interesting. Or crazy, depending on your point of view.
During the minute that students wait for Evive Stations to clean and fill their water bottles, the kiosks’ 32-inch high-def screens serve them interactive advertisements, internship opportunities, campus messaging, and offers. Evive Co-founder and CFO Jason Yablinsky tells us that the team wants to use advertising to offset the costs. Students go to Evive’s website, create a user profile, at which point the site asks them for some relevant demographic info. After checking appropriate boxes, they receive a redemption code which is linked to an RFID tag inside their new bottle.
Each time they go to a kiosk, they scan their bottle’s tag, and the cleaning and re-filling begins. The demographic data they collected from the student on their site is connected with the RFID tag, and they’re then served targeted ads that are relevant to their age, the classes they’re taking, what year they are, etc. While those ads and job opportunities play on the screen, students can request more information or post/tweet messages to their social media profiles linked to their user profiles.
Evive also plans to make space both on the kiosks and the water bottles distributed to students available for branding (which it’s offering for free now, but for purchase down the road), as well offering discounts and deals at local restaurants or coffee shops that will be relevant to hungry students looking for a bite, for example. Along with proximity ads that display digital billboards when someone walks by the station. Plus, they plan to offer realtime tracking of the amount of plastic bottles saved from the landfill, which campuses can then display to feel good about how green they’re becoming. Good PR for them as well as saving them from the cost of distributing bottled water.
There’s obviously a lot going on — a lot of moving parts in the Evive user experience — and that may make it a tough sell for some universities. And, really, Evive is attempting to blend a number of different industries and operations in one — beverage distribution, cleaning, campus/organizational services, steel bottle manufacturing and distributing, and so on. It’s an ambitious project, but one that the team is hoping has enough appeal in cost-savings and sustainability that it will outweigh the rest.
Evive has enlisted Flextronics — an electronics manufacturing services provider which counts Cisco Systems, Eastman Kodak, HP, Motorola, Dell, Oracle, and more as customers — to produce its kiosks. The startup has also raised $2 million in seed funding to get the ball rolling, and is currently in the process of closing a much larger Series A to help it expand to universities across the country. The team is tentatively planning to be in up to 30 universities by the year’s end.
Right now, Evive is testing its system at West Virginia University, where it’s placed four stations in various buildings. Over 4K students have signed up to use Evive, and the co-founders tell us that they can’t distribute water bottles fast enough. So far, they’ve had a lot of interest from both big state schools and private colleges. They aren’t ready to say who they’re working with yet, but they’ve been encouraged by the interest both from campuses, organizations, and investors.
And to that point, the team is focusing on universities now, and for the near future, but eventually wants to open up its service to businesses, corporations, and more.
What do you think? Is Evive an innovative, ergonomic solution or just full of water?

561,Vigilent Raises $6.7M From Accel For Intelligent Data Center Energy Management System,https://techcrunch.com/2012/03/26/vigilent-raises-6-7m-from-accel-for-intelligent-data-center-energy-management-system/,2012/03/26,"
Vigilent, a company that provides intelligent energy management systems for data centers, telecommunications facilities and large buildings, has raised $6.7 million in investments led by Accel Partners. This investment is part of Accel’s new $100 million Big Data fund. Angel investors including Gaurav Garg and Peter Wagner also participated in this round.
The startup’s services help data centers with energy efficiency. As Vigilent’s CEO Mark Housley explains, one of the biggest challenges companies face when managing data centers is cooling. In fact, he says cooling accounts for 50 percent of data center energy costs, and downtime (caused by cooling disruptions) can cost as much as $5,600 per minute for a company.
Vigilent equips data centers with wireless sensors for real-time data collection. The data feeds into a server which determines if/where decreases or increases in cooling are required, and then sends a signal to the correct air conditioner, turning it on or off or adjusting the variable fan speed accordingly.
Basically, Vigilent uses the power of Big Analytics to optimize energy management in data centers and telco central offices. The system analyzes Big Data from hundreds to thousands of wireless sensors deployed throughout a single data center or portfolio-wide, to deliver real-time information informing an artificial intelligence engine at the core of the Vigilent system.
This provides constant updates to dynamically control cooling and air handling resources. The system adapts and balances resources to meet demand delivering reduced energy costs, and more. Because of the massive amount of historical data collected, Vigilent also aims to detect subtle correlations further down the long tail of historic data that would otherwise go unnoticed.
“Vigilent has demonstrated a unique ability to harness data center energy-use while providing actionable, non-intuitive operational energy management insights through Big Data analytics,” said Accel partner Rich Wong. “With proven technology and a significant track record with Fortune 50 companies, we believe Vigilent will have a transformative effect on energy efficiency in critical building infrastructure.”
The company, which has seen 90 deployments throughout the U.S., Canada and Japan, is profitable, and on track to double revenues again this year. Housely says Vigilent operated energy management solutions for Verizon and reduced cooling costs by 40 to 50 percent. Other clients include Akamai, Nttdocomo, and NTT Communications.
The new funding will be used for product development, working capital and to expand further into Europe and Asia.
The company faces competition from Synapsense.

562,Health Startup Help Remedies Takes On Blood Cancer With… A Bandage Kit,https://techcrunch.com/2012/03/06/help-remedies-bone-marrow-kit/,2012/03/06,"
Debuting last week at the TED Conference was a new product by a pharma startup, which has largely flown under the radar. The company’s name may not be familiar, but you may have noticed its smartly designed products in drug stores around the country.
Founded in 2008, Help Remedies is a pharma startup trying to make waves in an industry dominated by Goliaths by re-imagining the over-the-counter (OTC) medication experience. The startup is doing so with a line of OTC products, or medicine kits, distinguished by minimalist, eco-friendly packaging and smart design in an effort to help reduce the overwhelming amount of product choices most consumers experience when perusing the medication aisles at their local pharmacies.
Last week, Help Remedies launched a new product called “Help, I Want to Save a Life”, an easy-to-use, DIY bone marrow donor registry kit, which is a more targeted supplement to your standard Band-Aid fix as well as the company’s already existing “Help I’ve Cut Myself” kit.
While Help typically targets minor ailments like headaches and stuffy noses, in this case the company decided to take on something larger. Richard Fine, Help CEO, explains, “Each year thousands of people with leukemia and other blood cancers need a bone marrow transplant to live, yet fewer than half receive one. This is a simple and smart idea: By making registration a part of what people are already doing, we think we can get more people to register, and in doing so, help save lives.”
Help has partnered with DKMS, the world’s largest bone marrow donor center, to process help I want to save a life kits, which contain sterile swabs and a postage-paid envelope. Using the kit is simple: The potential donor swabs the blood from their cut, and then mails the swabs in the envelope to DKMS to begin the donor registration process. The idea for the product was conceived by Graham Douglas, a copywriter at agency Droga5, after his brother, who was fighting leukemia, received a life-saving bone marrow transplant.
Douglas embarked on a decade-long search for a simpler way to encourage people to sign up as bone marrow donors — but found little success. Recently, in teaching a class at the Miami Ad School in Brooklyn, he challenged his students to come up with a smart, simple solution to finding matches for the some 10,000 people who need bone marrow transplants every year. Together, they decided that the best approach would be to (somehow) convince pharma companies to include blood swab registry kits inside Band-Aid boxes or adhesive bandages.
He pitched the idea to every pharma and adhesive bandage company he could think of, without making much headway, until he received a note from Help Remedies. The company thought that the idea represented a great opportunity to tackle something bigger.
Help CEO Richard Fine explained:
Each year thousands of people with leukemia and other blood cancers need a bone marrow transplant to live, yet fewer than half receive one. This is a simple and smart idea: By making registration a part of what people are already doing, we think we can get more people to register, and in doing so, help save lives.
After seeing the potential, which was really a no-brainer given the company’s existing product set, Help teamed up with Douglas to develop a kit, partnering with DKMS, the world’s largest bone marrow donor center, to establish the program. The team designed the “I Want To Save A Life” kits to be as simple, and easy-to-use as possible: They consist of just a few sterile swabs and a postage-paid envelope addressed to DKMS.
And thus, using the kit is easy. Say you’re shaving and you happen to knick yourself while doing so. There’s your opportunity. Users just swab the blood from their cut, drop it into the long-flap, double-sealed envelope (which makes sure the contents aren’t jeopardized before they reach their destination), and mail that sucker to DKMS to begin the registration process.
Therein lies the brilliance. Generally speaking, the friction inherent to the process that keeps people from donating is perception that they either don’t know how to do it (and aren’t told how) or that it costs too much (money, time, education) to do so. Now, for $4 Help Remedies is offering a kit of 16 bandages that can help stop all those pesky cuts — with a bone marrow donor registration kit to boot.
Plus, they’re involving some smart advertising for the campaign. All in all, it may not be application of technology in the traditional sense, but as Peter Thiel has been known to define technological progress as “doing more with less,” this is a great example of a simple, elegant solution to an important health problem.

563,Cleantech-Focused Incubator Greenstart Now Offering Startups An Extra $100K,https://techcrunch.com/2012/03/05/cleantech-focused-incubator-greenstart-now-offering-startups-an-extra-100k/,2012/03/05,"
Remember Greenstart, the San Francisco-based startup accelerator trying to make cleantech sexy? Well, today, it’s taking a big leap in that direction. The organization announced it’s bumping up the amount of funding its companies will receive. In addition to the $15,000 in seed funding the incubator provides, startups now also have the opportunity to receive a $100,000 convertible note.
The convertible notes are being drawn from a $6 million fund, which will cover the next 60 companies participating in the program – meaning, the next 6 classes of startups over the next 3 years. Money for the fund, which is currently half committed to, has been raised from a broad group of investors, including angels, VC’s, and even family funds, all of which are interested in supporting these types of startups, Greenstart co-founder Mitch Lowe tells us.
With the additional financing available, the hope is that Greenstart will be able to attract even more developers, he says.
“This allows the startups in the program to stay focused on customer and product development instead of hitting the streets for investors,” explains Lowe. “It should also help Greenstart attract interest from a much wider pool of innovative entrepreneurs for our upcoming programs.”
Previously, Greenstart offered $25,000 in seed funding, but lowered that to $15,000 now that the companies have the extra $100k option. They’ve also lowered the equity stake from 6 percent to 5 percent, we’re told.
Like other startup incubators, Greenstart provides mentoring, discounts, office space, etc., plus it also recently launched an in-house design practice, led by new COO David Merkoski, the former Executive Creative Director of frog design. The design practice is meant to help participating companies with their UI and UX needs – something that’s often lacking in the cleantech space.
But the extra funding is the biggest news for this relatively new organization.
“$15,000 is Ramen money,” Lowe jokes. “With $115,000, you can really make some progress.”
Greenstart just opened up applications to its Fall 2012 program today – the deadline for submission is April 11th.

564,Koubachi Wi-Fi Plant Sensor Takes The Guesswork Out Of Container Gardening,https://techcrunch.com/2012/03/03/koubachi-wi-fi-plant-sensor-takes-the-guesswork-out-of-container-gardening/,2012/03/03,"
Houseplants can be hard to care for, even when watered regularly on a sunny windowsill. A new device from Swiss startup Koubachi takes the guesswork out of plant care through real-time monitoring and notifications when the plant needs attention.
“Many people don’t know what plant they have and what it needs,” says Koubachi co-founder and CEO Philipp Bolliger. “You try your best and still your plant withers.”
The company’s interactive plant care assistant tucks into a pot, tracking its water, fertilizer, humidity, temperature and light levels. Just tell it what species of flora you’ve got flowering, and it’ll tell you how and when to care for it. Koubachi analyzes your individual plant’s data in addition to your care habits to provide personalized feedback via email or iPhone push notifications. It also takes into account your geographic weather data and season.

The sensor sends data into the cloud via Wi-Fi. From there, it is analyzed and synced to the web and iPhone app. The interface provides an overview of your potted plant oasis. The sensor can be moved to different pots, calibrating its recommendations to each plant’s individual needs.

Koubachi is ready to analyze more than 135 plant species. Currently, the most popular plants are the Orchid (Phalaenopsis), the Weeping Fig (Ficus benjamina) and the Dragon Tree (Dracaena marginata). The company plans to have 5,000 plants by the end of the year, and their 10-person team includes a plant physiologist focused solely on adding new species to the database. The sensor is currently available for purchase in euros, with a planned U.S. retail rollout next year.

565,Australian Ride-Sharing Marketplace Jayride.com Grabs $400K In Angel Funding,https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/21/australian-ride-sharing-marketplace-jayride-com-grabs-400k-in-angel-funding/,2012/02/21,"
Australian-based travel marketplace Jayride.com has lined up $400,000 AUD in seed funding for its ride-sharing service, which also aggregates transportation data. The angel funding was led by Andrey Shirben, one of the first investors in Kenshoo, a digital marketing software company. In addition to helping in the financing, Shirben will also bring his digital marketing expertise to assist the company, as well as connect Jayride with other players in the global travel sector.
Compared with other current ride-sharing and carpooling startups, Jayride’s unique angle is to provide a single interface for finding all your transportation options, including commercial transport, and combining that data with the available ride-sharing options. This way, travelers will never be in a situation where they research a route and end up without options. Instead, when there are no ride-shares found on your planned route, Jayride will show you bus schedules, shuttles, relocation cars and other transportation options.
Shirben tells us that the angel round was supposed to be for $350,000 AUD, but after he put his money in, it became overbooked by 30-40%. Within a year, Jayride plans to raise another round led by a U.S. VC firm, as it prepares to expand its geographical transport data coverage.
“Jayride is the only land-transport marketplace attacking ride-sharing this way,” says Shirben of the startup’s transport data aggregation play. “There are many ride-sharing startups around the world, but almost every one fails this simple UX test: if you search from point A to point B outside a main thoroughfare, you find no search results. This is the main limitation of ride-sharing today.”
Shirben says that after meeting the Jayride founding team, and following up over the course of a few months, the decision to invest was an easy one. “Great team, disruptive idea, lots of business potential in a huge market,” he remarks.
Founded in 2008 by Rod Bishop and Ross Lin as a carpooling site, Jayride made the move to aggregate all travel data last fall. The service currently supports Australia, New Zealand, and is coming soon to the U.K. and Ireland.

566,Apple’s “Project Dolphin” Green Energy Facility In North Carolina Among Nation’s Biggest,https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/20/apples-project-dolphin-green-energy-facility-in-north-carolina-among-nations-biggest/,2012/02/20,"
Word got around way back in the middle of 2010 that Apple was building a monster data center near Maiden, South North Carolina. Later, it was shown to be hosting a ton of Nuance software, for obvious reasons. Less widely reported was the fact that nearby, scores of acres were being cleared for a solar array.
Now, it turns out that solar array will be the largest “end user-owned, onsite” one in the nation. They’re also planning a biogas/fuel-cell facility with similar credentials.
The information comes from Apple’s latest environmental report which, it should be noted, has nothing at all to do with the environmental factors involved in the actual manufacturing of Apple goods. Nor does the “Waste and Recycling” section detail the fact that Apple is regularly rated as being among the least eco-conscious packagers and device-builders in the world. But that is all by the by. The report is a voluntary, domestic one.
The facilities, neither of which is complete (with no date set for completion), are directly adjacent to the new datacenter, which is itself in a league of its own in terms of energy efficiency. The solar array will cover 100 acres and produce 20 megawatts or 42 million kilowatt-hours annually, depending on how you want to measure it. The fuel cell installation will be 5 megawatts, providing around the same kWh.
The datacenter has been estimated to require as much as 100 megawatts, however, so the rest will, of course, be made up by the coal plants powering much of North Carolina. And saying it’s the biggest “end user-owned, onsite” facility is putting rather a fine point on it. Still meritorious, just not revolutionary.
It seemed to me that in light of recent criticism of Apple’s policies regarding its manufacturing partners abroad (including my own), it was only fair to provide this information as well. Not because Apple somehow deserves it, but because it helps give an idea of how money can and must be invested in tech. China has invested trillions and decades to creating the manufacturing capabilities it has today. It would be folly to attempt the same in the US, starting today — a US-built iPhone is not a proposal that bears any scrutiny.
But there are great advantages to locating datacenters in the US, and in investing heavily in green power. Most major companies are doing so, and almost none are opting to manufacture goods locally. At the moment, even major investments like this one are peanuts compared to the costs and scale of energy consumption and manufacturing power required elsewhere, but it’s nice to see records being set this way by Apple, even if it’s only a drop in the bucket.

567,"“Etsy For Eco” Ethical Community Raises $300,000+ In Seed Funding",https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/17/etsy-for-eco-ethical-community-raises-300000-in-seed-funding/,2012/02/17,"
Ethical Community, an online, eco-friendly marketplace (which has plans for a snazzier name in the works!), has secured a £200,000 ($316,640 USD) round of seed funding from a syndicate of angel investors, the company is announcing today. Founded in 2009, the marketplace has signed up over 850 sellers from around the world, who have now listed over 7,000 eco-friendly, organic and natural products including clothing, jewelry, health and beauty products, food and drink items, pet items and more.
The new investors include AlertMe.com CEO and ASOS.com board member Mary Turner, founding partner at Alchemy Partners, Robert Barnes, venture investor Kelvin Au, and CEO of Orange Advertising Networks, Giuliano Stiglitz.
The company was started by entrepreneurs Liam Patterson and Jason Dainter, who had the idea to connect customers to sellers in a more personal way. People want to hear the stories behind the products, explains Patterson. “To conscious shoppers, this story is more important than the visual appearance of the product,” he says.
As someone who is often the recipient of gifts like handmade, dye-free soaps and homemade jewelry, I know from first-hand experience that it’s the story that convinces the eco-friendly shopper to make their purchase. I never receive just the item in question as my gift, I also receive the card telling me about the story behind the product, as well as a personal anecdote regarding the item’s makers.
To be able to make that same one-on-one connection on the sometimes more impersonal platform of the web is a challenge, but one that seems worth the attempt. To personalize the experience, sellers can now create blog posts on the Ethical Community website to share their stories and interests, as well as post videos from their homes or workshops.
Ethical Community, which is based in the startup-friendly Shoreditch area of London, says it will use the seed funding to grow its seller and shopper base, continue its expansion plans, and launch an improved version of the site in the spring.
Admits co-founder Dainter, the focus until today has been acquiring great sellers, but now they’re working on rebranding. “To be honest, the name and brand needs a revamp, and the funding will help in that respect. Structurally, we have a lot of changes coming.”
One of those changes will involve making the video system a more predominant part of the site, and integrating it more heavily into the social feeds.
“Our brand is very much about the personal connection with buyers and sellers. Video is a great way to do that, so we’re intending to build on that,” Dainter says.

Things are going smoothly for Tesla. Their big Model X debut was a success, their cars are pre-ordered to capacity, and new business opportunities are presenting themselves. They’re still posting a net loss, of course, but that was expected and will continue for another year or so.
Here are the most salient points from their latest earnings statement, released today:

Total Q4 revenues: $39M (up 9% YOY)
Total 2011 revenues: $204M (up 75% vs. 2010)
Expected revenues for 2012: $550M-$600M (mostly in late 2012)
Operating expenses: $89M (GAAP)
Capital expenditures: $54M (mostly building production infrastructure)
Net Q4 losses: $81M (GAAP) or $0.78 per share on ~104M shares
Net 2011 losses: $264M (GAAP) or $2.53 per share
Beta Model S vehicles are being built at the nearly complete factory – 30 out of 50
Model S betas successfully do 0-60MPH in 4.5s
8000 total reservations for Model S
Model X debut caused 500 reservations, with $5000 commitment each
Model X to ship in late 2013 at around 10,000-15,000 units per year
New deal with Daimler to develop a new Mercedes all-electric powertrain
There are more Tesla battery packs at Daimler and Toyota than there are Roadsters

Everything seems to be going according to plan. 2012 should see the Model S hit the streets (in July) and Tesla-developed batteries and powertrains ship in partners’ vehicles. With luck we’ll have a chance to review the car and its interesting new dash system at that time.

569,"Greenstart Tightens Focus, Goes After “Sexy” Cleantech Startups",https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/15/greenstart-tightens-focus-goes-after-sexy-cleantech-startups/,2012/02/15,"
Greenstart, the San Francisco-based startup accelerator dedicated to the cleantech industry – and more importantly, to making it “sexy” enough to attract investors – announced its second cadre of of companies this week. This time around, the organization is tightening its focus to concentrate solely on the intersection of I.T. and cleantech, specifically in areas of smart grid, the built environment, consumer services and transportation.
It’s also being highly selective in terms of the startups accepted into the program. Of the 152 applicants, only five companies got in.
“We’re trying to make cleantech a little sexier in the investment community,” explains Greenstart co-founder Mitch Lowe who runs the program alongside five other entrepreneurs and greentech/cleantech believers. “Cleantech has gotten kind of a bad rap lately, and we want to show that this intersection of cleantech and I.T. has a lot of good investment opportunities,” he says.
To keep the quality of the startups high, Greenstart only selected the few startups it felt would really appeal to investors. But the plan is to ramp up the numbers so that, by next year, the accelerator will have around 12 to 15 companies per program, meaning it will work with at least 30 per year.
Despite the small size, round two is actually one startup larger than Greenstart’s first group, which only included four companies out of 129 applications. The high bar, however, has led to some success in terms of its goal of investor appeal. Of the initial four, one is approaching the close of a Series A round, two are doing mid-six figure angel rounds closing this month, and one is not yet in need of funding.
With the launch of the second cadre, Greenstart is also launching an in-house design practice which will be led by its new COO, David Merkoski, the former Executive Creative Director of frog design. The organization realized the need for design talent in this space during its first run, says Lowe.
“There tends to be a high aptitude for development and a high understanding of design importance, but so far that cleantech/I.T. connection hasn’t inspired designers to be a part of that founding team yet,” Lowe says. “In general right now, entrepreneurs are still driven to create the next Facebook instead figuring out the next Opower,” he explains. “The responsibility is on us and others to show that it’s just as exciting – if not more exciting – to do something in this category.”
Eventually, the goal is to build out a team of designers, but the program will launch with Merkoski and five junior designers and interns.
With the next cadre underway, participating startups receive all the typical benefits – mentoring, discounts, office space, etc., as well as $25,000 in seed funding. The companies (below) will demo to investors when the three month program completes. Here’s a sneak peek as to what they’re up to:

570,Sony To Offer NFC Authenticated Power Outlets,https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/14/sony-to-offer-nfc-authenticated-power-outlets/,2012/02/14,"
Sony is working on a new technology that authenticates devices via the power outlet, allowing for a few interesting applications. The system, based on the Japanese Felica standard, would allow authenticated power usage, power management for cafes and offices, as well as payments for power use. The system could authenticate with the power outlet via a chip inside the laptop or device or through a smartcard that user waves at the outlet.
According to the press release, the system will allow building and home owners to control power use from a central location and ensure people aren’t using power willy nilly.
This technology is definitely something we will soon see in modern buildings, at least in terms of energy maintenance. It may feel freaky to log in your power outlet, but if it keeps us from sucking down too many jiggawatts, we’ll probably all need to get on board.

571,New Hybrid Solar Cells Harness More Of The Sun’s Light Spectrum,https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/10/cambridge-hybrid-solar-cells/,2012/02/10,"
Scientists at the University of Cambridge in the UK have found a way to improve the efficiency of photovoltaic cells by as much as 25% through harnessing more of the sun’s spectrum than most traditional silicon-based solar cells can. 
The new design, developed at the university’s Cavendish Laboratory in the Department of Physics, can absorb both red and blue light, and generates electrons from photons at a two-to-one ratio on the blue light spectrum. Most current solar cells lose blue photon energy as heat, leaving them unable to turn more than about 34% of the sunlight they absorb into power. 

The team, led by professors Neil Greenham and Sir Richard Friend, recently published results in a paper. The hybrid cells have an added organic semiconductor called pentacene, which helps harness blue light energy to strengthen the electrical current coming from the cell, making the product up to 44% efficient. 
The university’s team also innovated on how the cells are made, by producing the cells in bulk using a roll-to-roll printing technique. While cheaper, more efficient photovoltaics sound promising, there remain hurdles to be overcome. The greatest costs in building a solar power plant are installation hardware, labor and land, so a cheaper solar cell is only a piece of the puzzle.

572,StartX Demo Day: A Direct Link Between Silicon Valley And Top Stanford Student Entrepreneurs,https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/10/startx-demo-day-a-direct-link-between-silicon-valley-and-top-stanford-student-entrepreneurs/,2012/02/10,"
On the surface, the StartX Demo Day last night could have looked like any other accelerator pushing its latest class of startups. Nine groups got on stage and fired off presentations about how they were working on something cool, and why they deserved funding.
But it wasn’t the rash of lightweight consumer applications you often see at other demo days. These were Stanford students, particularly technical graduate students, who have been nerding out on solving real problems for years in their labs and dorm rooms, and who are now in the middle of commercializing their hard work. Big-name investors from around Silicon Valley unsurprisingly showed up to check them out.
Before I get into the companies, which ran the gamut from health care to batteries to professional networking, it’s important to understand what StartX is. It’s the non-profit accelerator arm of Stanford Student Enterprises, which is a student-run, independent organization that handles a variety of stores, directories, financial services and other businesses for students. SSE is the business branch of the student government, and it’s independent enough from the university that StartX companies get maximum freedom. They own their own intellectual property, and neither StartX/SSE nor any other entity takes any equity.
The only requirements are that at least one cofounder of each applying company needs to have enrolled at Stanford within the last three academic quarters before the application period, and that person needs to own significant equity.
The program is young — it started in 2010 and this is its fifth class. but it’s on the right track. The energy in the room was what you feel at that rare tech event where everyone present knows they’re getting in early on something big.
We’ll no doubt be covering many of the presenting companies in more detail over the coming months, but here’s a quick look at each, in the order they presented:
MindSumo: Employers want to find smart students with skills and interests that they can develop. The problem is that student resumes are normally skimpy on this information because, well, students have mostly been in school and not the workforce. MindSumo’s answer: partner with employers to create “challenges,” or sets of questions for students to answer. For example, Recology, a large recycling and trash disposal company, is currently asking “What can you do or make with glass (A LOT of it)? Propose three alternate uses for recycled glass so that we can use our resources in an innovative way and keep them from landfill!” Currently in private beta, MindSumo has already been running challenges for seven companies (some of whom are paying), with 500 or so Stanford students participating.

AgeTak: Health care data is currently separated across insurers and health care providers, which makes it hard for doctors to do comprehensive analysis of diseases and other conditions. AgeTak uses distributed databases to combine, anonymize and get user consent for data sharing. Founder Pratik Verma, who recently got his PhD in computation chemistry from Stanford, is on a personal mission here. His father passed away in 2010 from nerve cell disease ALS, which has no known causes or cures. His father’s only option was to participate in extensive clinical trials over the years, in the hopes that doctors would make breakthroughs by discovering trends among those afflicted. But, as Pratik discovered, data from patients was not being shared by researchers because it was siloed at institutions, and held back by privacy concerns.
Through AgeTak, the anonymized and aggregated data can be used by analysts, researchers, physicians and pharmaceutical companies. Insurance giant United Health is already using it for a drug claims database, and OptumHealth is using it to offer graphs that show consumers how their health care costs stack up against the average. AgeTak has already made $3.7 million in revenue; it’s headquartered in Minnesota with offices in Menlo Park and India. Check out this recent writeup by Barb Darrow at GigaOm for more details.

Zoku: If you’re trying to build a network — let’s say, to help with your new startup — you want to know who out there is doing something relevant to your needs. But it can be hard sorting through all the noise on Facebook, LinkedIn and other sites to spot the key people and activities. Zoku lets you combine your email and social networking contacts, then pick out people and actions that you want to keep track of. It uses algorithms to filter for what you care about, then shows you the signals — people who are visiting town, changing jobs, or doing anything else relevant to what you might need to get done — in a dashboard on its site.

Vi Energy: In what looks like the most ambitious technical idea out of all the presentations, Vi Energy is developing a new kind of rechargeable battery that promises to be three times cheaper and last 50% longer than anything on the market today. Over the past twenty years, lithium ion batteries have dominated, but they can be unsafe, have relatively weak capacity, and are expensive. As a mature technology, there’s only marginal improvements to be had from them. Sister-cofounders Meghali and Sonali Chopra have, with the support of top scientific researchers, already created a pilot battery that uses significantly cheaper raw materials, can be easily synthesized, and has a unique spherical morphology with conductive codings for better performance. Their lab tests already show that the new battery lasts longer than the lithium ion ones on the market today.

Breakthrough: This online mental health treatment startup has been featured before — on stage at TechCrunch 50 (Disrupt) back in 2009. It uses secure video and chat features to help people connect with professionals to get the help they need privately and immediately. As Leena noted before, clients can search for providers (including psychiatrists, psychologists and nurses) on a variety of criteria, including price, speciality (i.e. clinical depression, schizophrenia, post traumatic stress disorder), and gender. On a provider’s page you can see his or her education, experience, pricing for services, the insurance the professional accepts, and even a video introduction of the provider explaining his or her specialities. BreakThrough certifies all providers are credentialed professionals.

TipTopMed: How much will a trip to the doctor’s cost? How much, in particular, if you don’t have a good insurance plan? That’s a question more and more Americans are asking themselves — that TipTopMed is trying to answer. Its site will show local providers, and include information about them like the upfront price, and other details about provider specialties. Users can then book an appointment, and pay online. Providers — mostly small and medium-sized businesses — want this because they lose lots of money on patients who can’t or don’t pay. The site is launching at the end of this month, and will feature a proprietary database of Bay Area health care professionals.

Smit’s Crew: The only entertainment-oriented startup out of the mix, it offers a web site and mobile app that lets venue owners (bars, clubs, etc.) create a type of loyalty program for regular patrons. The app lets customers receive advance notifications of discounts and other deals, particularly on slow nights, then buy them immediately. They then go to the establishment and show the waiter or bartender the purchase; because payment has been received, the food and drinks can be delivered immediately, without the hassle of trying to pay with cash or credit card at, say, a packed bar. Even more importantly, the app lets owners keep track of which people are visiting the most regularly and buying the most — this allows them to figure out who they should focus on providing the best service to. The “crew” concept lets customers group themselves together around specific establishments, so the venue can provide group discounts if they show up.

There were also two more health care startups that presented, but they haven’t publicly launched yet so I won’t be including them here. All in all, as you can see, this is a serious bunch of companies, that are interested in solving hard real-world problems.
Venture firms and law offices in Silicon Valley have sensed the opportunity to get in early, and they’ve rallied behind the effort. VC supporters, who provide dollars and mentorship, include Benchmark Capital, General Catalyst, Khosla Ventures, Charles River Ventures and Greylock Partners. Legal backers are Cooley LLP, Fenwick & West LLP, Dorsey & Whitney LLP, Goodwin Proctor, and Orrick. Resource partners include Amazon Web Services, First Republic Bank, Fog Creek Software, Github, Rackspace and Usabilla.
And even that distant global media and advertising conglomerate that owns TechCrunch is involved, it turns out, because it provides office space and other material support. So time for a Full Disclosure: I didn’t even know AOL was involved until I got to the event this afternoon — but good job, whoever made that call at my parent company. I also attended Stanford as an undergraduate, and while I have a variety of feelings about my alma mater, I generally expect a lot out of its graduates — maybe this connection is one reason I think StartX is pretty great? On the other hand, I worked at a key campus competitor to SSE, The Stanford Daily student-run newspaper. So maybe I’m biased against SSE and so my biases all equal themselves out….

573,White House Pushes Green Button To Liberate Your Energy Data,https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/05/green-button/,2012/02/05,"
The future of easy home energy monitoring may be a little bit closer, thanks to a government initiative designed to allow consumers direct access to their energy consumption data.
The White House’s new Green Button gives utilities a way to simplify and standardize sharing usage statistics with their customers via a one-click download. Two California providers, Pacific Gas & Electric and San Diego Gas & Electric, already launched the feature, adding what is literally a green button to their websites. Utility companies in other regions are expected to implement it within the next year. Customers can click the button to download their personal usage information in one place. 
The interesting aspect isn’t so much in the download itself, but what can be done with it. Federal officials hope this kind of data liberation will inspire developers to build apps and services that will help customers track and reduce their energy consumption. One study showed that subjects who were given access to their data reduced their usage by 8.7% just by tracking it. At scale, this could mean an annual savings of $32 billon per year on the country’s annual $369 billion power bill.  
The Green Button was inspired by the government’s success with its Blue Button initiative, which allows veterans instant access to their health care data.

574,Algorithms/Data vs. Analysts/Reports: Fight!,https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/04/algorithmsdata-vs-analystsreports-fight/,2012/02/04,"
Quick, what’s the second most traded commodity in the world, after oil? Sorry, no: it’s not coffee. In fact, while hard data is scant, it may well be — of all things — carbon. No, really. According to the World Bank (PDF) , the global carbon market was worth a whopping 1.42 Facebooks US$142 billion in 2010.
Mind you, it’s not like container ships weighed down to the gills with graphite are crossing and recrossing the Pacific every week. What we’re actually talking about here is the trade in carbon offsets, ie, the absence of carbon. Very Zen, no? Techies should be comfortable with this notion; I seem to recall spending less time studying electrons than I did “holes,” ie their absence, while acquiring my EE degree…
Anyway, where there’s a $twelve-figures market, there are startups fighting for a share. In particular, there’s a battle on to see who will be the primary aggregator of carbon-market data. On one side, dominating the market, I give you the Goliaths Point Carbon, a tentacle of the Thomson Reuters kraken, providing “independent news, analysis and consulting services for European and global power, gas and carbon markets,” and Bloomberg New Energy Finance, doing much the same. On the other, I give you plucky little David eCO2Market, a Paris-based startup with an algorithmic sling.
Point Carbon and BNEF crank out tomes and tomes of research analysis and offer subscription-based information tools. eCO2Market dispenses with weighty reports, and disintermediates analysts and researchers. Instead it tries to build up the biggest, most thorough, and most up-to-date database of carbon-market information, and then gives its users algorithmic tools to search, slice, dice, and organize that data themselves. The more users pay, the better the tools. (They have a free tier, too, if you’re a data geek who wants to play with what they’ve got.)
“It’s our job to take this incredibly convoluted carbon area and put it into a nice little package for investors, environmentalists, everyone, and make it as easy as possible to find projects and their participants, buy credits, or make an investment,” says Chris Draper of eCO2Market. For instance, solar-power company ToughStuff uses eCO2Market’s data to find early-stage solar projects who might be ideal ToughStuff customers.
It’s anyone’s guess whether they’ll thrive. The carbon market is in something of a fraught state right now: aside from the embarrassing theft of millions of dollars worth of carbon credits by hackers a year ago, what the World Bank delicately refers to as “regulatory uncertainty” — ie the stalled attempts to cement a successor to the Kyoto Protocol — means that the near-term future is at best uncertain.
On the other hand, this year should see the launch of the Western Climate Initiative, a cap-and-trade system involving California, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec; and in the long run, though, cap-and-trade carbon markets are probably a growth bet. Either way, eCO2Market is an interesting example of a small startup disrupting an information market by replacing human-written research and analysis with big-data aggregation, algorithms, and visualization. The optimal solution probably features both…but it says here the scale will tip further towards the latter with every passing year.

575,The Wheel: What Is The Foxconn Debate Really About?,https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/03/the-wheel-what-is-the-foxconn-debate-really-about/,2012/02/03,"
Thirty spokes meet at a nave;
Because of the hole we may use the wheel.
Clay is moulded into a vessel;
Because of the hollow we may use the cup.
Walls are built around a hearth;
Because of the doors we may use the house.
Thus tools come from what exists,
But use from what does not.
– Tao De Ching
There’s a carousel in a small Cape Cod town that we visited this summer and the kids rode it a few times. The carousel is quite old and quite handsome and it makes a great diversion of an evening. I’m reminded now of trying to take pictures of the kids while they rode the carousel. For a while I’d wave and try to get their attention as they roared past, their laughter dopplering around the edge of the curve, and then, after four or five tries I’d give up and just watch. It’s a wheel, an endless circle, designed to delight and enthuse and distract.
Reading the recent back and forth between Stephen Fry – an Apple apologist – and Mike Daisey – an Apple user/abuser – I’m reminded of that carousel. The gist is this: Mike Daisey woke up the NPR-listening world with his long piece of Foxconn for This American Life. It was a great piece – dramatic, educational, and eye-opening – but it’s definitely nothing we haven’t seen before. Some could say that it was The Jungle of Chinese manufacturing, a tell-all with just enough outrage to make us rethink a great horror. But the problem is this: Daisey is an actor and knows how to bring out the story, just as John Steinbeck was a writer and knew how to populate the Dust Bowl with Christ figures. That doesn’t make the story less effective – it makes it more so – but it does make the story less true.
The problem is the endless circle of blame and apology. Daisey is correct in many of his assumptions, but offers a way forward that is currently unenforceable. But if you argue against Daisey’s points, you’re an apologist. But, as Paul Krugman writes:
Such moral outrage is common among the opponents of globalization — of the transfer of technology and capital from high-wage to low-wage countries and the resulting growth of labor-intensive Third World exports. These critics take it as a given that anyone with a good word for this process is naive or corrupt and, in either case, a de facto agent of global capital in its oppression of workers here and abroad.
We keep going over the same ground here. The argument can be delineated like this: Foxconn is an evil sweatshop. Apple is a huge Foxconn customer. They should change things. Two of those things are true, a third is false.
To be clear, I’m with the crowd that says that Apple is, at best, ignorant of Foxconn’s problems and at worst ignoring them. I agree things must change and Apple is in a great position to do it. But I don’t agree with the first point. I’ve seen sweat shops and Foxconn is a factory. If many of the major brands (I recall that Ford was a customer at one factory I visited) knew that their promotional USB keys were made in a building that looked like a gulag, they’d be skewered. Here’s hoping they are, one day. However, Daisey’s Foxconn story – written outside of the factory – and my own research, written inside the factory – don’t jibe. His discoveries that people get sick or are injured in factories are naive and I suspect his sample size of employees who approached him is far smaller than we realize. To go into the Foxconn factory is to see a place staffed by college-age kids and engineers who work 10 or so hours a day building electronics. There is no great Dickensian work house nor are there sad-eyed madonnas of the assembly line chained to the soldering irons. This isn’t the mundanity of evil – this is just mundanity.
Nor am I saying that Daisey’s interviewees are malingerers with an axe to grind. I’m sure their lives are ruined or much harder thanks to Foxconn. The value of Daisey’s efforts is his ability to give these people a voice in an environment that would normally quash that voice. He’s doing what artists must do – reflecting a time and place through his own lens.
My own opinion is simple: Apple needs to do more for the people in its manufacturing chain. I will not pretend that Apple can simply wave a magic wand and make every Foxconn employee rich and happy, but it has the cash and the wherewithal to further disrupt the Chinese supply chain and improve the lot of Foxconn’s employees. But I also agree with what one Gawker commenter said: “I believe Tim Cook will do more good for those employees (and already has, in point of fact) than Mike Daisey ever will.” Apple on the aggregate couldn’t care less about our existence nor does it deserve our undying respect and admiration. On an personal level there are plenty of folks inside Apple working and worrying about worker’s rights in China, but as an entity we are talking supply chains and price management. Apple makes excellent tools for our digital age, that’s it. To defend or excoriate the company is like screaming into the wind. However, through their constant rejiggering and improvements, they have essentially created a Western, ISO-compliant factory environment in a corporate culture that used to force underperforming employees to stand outside wearing a sign that said “I am a bad worker.”
What Daisey did is made us think. Did he do it the right way, using the right tools? Absolutely not. Will he improve the lot of the workers he interviewed? I doubt it. But will his efforts – and the efforts of many who came before him – help bring the Chinese worker out of penury? Sure, eventually.
I opened this piece talking about a carousel in Cape Cod, a delightfully bourgeois setting for a piece on poverty wage labor practices. I get to go to Cape Cod and put my kids on a carousel because my job involves dicking around on the Internet all day (I suspect Daisey’s does too). My one wish is that every Foxconn employee, at some point in their lives, will be able to sit down to an unhurried meal, chat with family, and maybe ride a carousel. I think it’s in Foxconn’s best interests to ensure that that happens – and soon – and I think that we’re nearly there. Things will get better, I’m sure of it, and I also feel that they already have.

576,GreenCharge App Reveals Cost and Carbon Savings To Electric Car Drivers,https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/31/greencharge-app-reveals-cost-and-carbon-savings-to-electric-car-drivers/,2012/01/31,"
Electric car drivers deserve to see their positive impact on the environment and their wallets, but the official mobile apps for the Nissan LEAF and Chevy Volt only display remaining battery. GreenCharge is a new iOS app released today that displays your car’s remaining charge, but also its current range, the local energy price, a log of its usage, and your cost and carbon reduction versus driving a gasoline vehicle. Finally, an app that shows how you’re saving both kinds of green.
The app was developed by Xatori Inc, creators of PlugShare, the largest electric vehicle charging network in the United States. It’s the second product from the Palo Alto-based company, fueled by $400,000 in seed funding and three full-time employees. CEO Forrest North engineered for Tesla and was the CEO of electric vehicle component company Mission Motors. CTO Armen Petrosian developed anodes for Amprius and was on the Stanford Solar Car Team.
Just like the official LEAF and Volt apps, the $9.99 GreenCharge wirelessly connects to your car via cell signals know as telematics. Once authorized, GreenCharge continuously records your EV’s usage creating a logbook of your total, peak, and average energy expenditure. GreenCharge ties this to local energy costs, providing the most accurate way to determine the cost of driving a electric car.
The app also gives you plenty to feel good about. You’ll see your monetary savings and the pounds of carbon offset by not driving a gas guzzler. You can put some friendly pressure on others to consider electric vehicles by sharing how much money you saved to Facebook, Twitter, or email.
Since Xatori’s PlugShare app is already free, it might make sense to add its functionality within a tab of GreenCharge for easy access. The ability to share other stats beyond money saved would useful too. An Android version of GreenCharge on the way.
A vague sense of helping the environment isn’t enough. EV sales won’t surge until their financial benefits become common knowledge.  By educating drivers and their social networks, GreenCharge could get the mainstream to plug in.

578,Retroficiency Identifies Building Energy Inefficiencies Without Ever Stepping Inside,https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/20/retroficiency-building-energy/,2012/01/20,"
Buildings are blamed for as much as 40% of U.S. energy consumption, and while green construction is on the rise, identifying the best ways to make an older building more efficient can be a tedious manual endeavor. Retroficiency, whose aim is to disrupt the energy efficiency market, eases the process with the help of extensive data sets and predictive analytics.
Greening an old building traditionally involves a walk-through analysis or diagnostic hardware installation, but the Boston-based company’s new Virtual Energy Assessment (VEA) tool shows energy service providers which changes within the building will have the greatest impact on its efficiency. Retroficiency focuses on commercial real estate, which uses 18% of the country’s energy and spending close to $108 billion annually.
“The heavy lifting that takes weeks or months to do manually, we can do in minutes,” says Co-Founder and CEO Bennett Fisher.
Some of the things VEA might observe about a building are that the lighting turns on three hours before anyone arrives, or that heating and cooling systems sometimes operate simultaneously.
The product’s technology is largely powered by the company’s November acquisition of of Nexamp’s Clean Energy Solutions. To analyze a structure, VEA only requires the building address and a year’s worth of energy use interval data, compressing a process that can take several months into several minutes. This helps energy service providers quickly identify which buildings in their network have the highest efficiency improvement potential and what specific improvements will have the greatest impact within each of those buildings.
“Our mission is to scale energy efficiency,” says Fisher, “It’s what needs to happen if we want to make a dent in the environmental and carbon problem.”

First, Japan got the world’s first connected home garden device, and now it’s time for Nippon to get the world’s first cloud-based LED lighting system. Developed by Tokyo-based lighting tech startup Net LED Technology Corp., the so-called NetLED system will go on sale in Japan on February 20 (here‘s the company’s English website).
The 40W lights, which have a 40,000-hour lifespan, come with built-in Wi-Fi: users can control each tube over the web after installing the NetLed app on a smartphone, tablet, or computer (the iPhone app is already out, while iPad and Android apps will be released this summer). It’s possible to dim the lights (each tube has 10 different dimming levels) and to turn them on or off.

Users can control individual, multiple, or a set of lights (which can be located in separate rooms) via the app, which also offers a timer function. The system also makes it possible to track energy usage in real-time and to automatically aggregate data over an extended period of time.
Net LED says that when a company, for example, uses 200 of these lights, power consumption can be pushed down by up to 50%.

Using the app and Net LED’s servers is free.
The system’s own costs depend on how many lights are needed: the price for the control box/router set (see above) is fixed at US$780. One Wi-Fi-enabled tube (US$260) can be connected to up to three NetLED lights without a Wi-Fi module (those lights cost US$180 each), resulting in sets of four lights (as you can see above).

The bracelet identifies you to the building and allows it to follow you from room to room. Is the meeting room too cold? Press a button and it starts to warm up. It will also prepare rooms for your arrival, reading your patterns of movement over time. If it sounds creepy, it is.
MIT researchers Joe Paradiso and Brian Mayton began the project in October and connects with a number of environmental sensors to ensure a “smart” building stays smart yet allows “fine-grained” control over the environment.

581,Kite-Like Turbines Harness Wind Power At Altitude,https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/16/kite-like-turbines-harness-wind-power-at-altitude/,2012/01/16,"
Flying a kite to produce power may conjure up images of Ben Franklin, who sought to prove lightning was electric. Makani Power releases a turbine blade into the air, seeking to harness wind energy at higher altitudes. 
The Makani Airborne Wind Turbines, which resemble mini airplanes, are launched when wind speeds reach 3.5 meters per second. Rotors on each blade help propel it into orbit, and double as turbines once airborne. The blades are tethered to the ground with a cord that delivers power to throw them into the sky and receives energy generated by the turbines to be sent to the grid-connected ground station. 

Once in the air, the wing takes on a circular flight path, perpendicular to the wind’s direction. The crosswind hitting the rotors can pack more than 10 times the actual wind speed, and the blade can adjust position to meet it. Wind speeds can generally be twice as fast at altitude than near ground level as well, making the airborne blade potentially more powerful than ground-based turbines. Their light weight also makes them cheaper to produce than traditional turbines, and maintenance work can be performed on the ground.  
When wind speeds drop below nine miles per hour, the blade shifts to hover mode and is reeled in to dock at the ground station.

The company was awarded $3 million from the Department of Energy’s ARPA-E program, and has also received $20 million in funding from Google. 
While these turbines have potential, they are still being tested. Makani plans to construct larger wings that can reach heights of 1,600 feet and power 600 homes. The company’s current timeline for the largest prototype is 2013, with hopes of starting commercial production two years later.

583,Could ‘Spider-Worm’ Silk Be The Next Supermaterial?,https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/05/spider-worm-silk/,2012/01/05,"
Spiderman might soon lose his dominance in harnessing spider silk superpowers. Scientists from the University of Wyoming, the University of Notre Dame and Zhejiang University in China have managed to genetically modify silkworms to spin stronger silk using spider genes. The new material could be used for everything from bulletproof vests to replacing tough plastics.
Researchers have long been fascinated with spider silk, a natural material that is stronger than steel. Harvesting the stuff can be tricky, however, since spiders are poor candidates for farming. Not only are they territorial, eating each other when confined to a tight space, but they are hard to handle and produce a very small amount of silk.
Silkworms, on the other hand, have helped clothe humans for millennia without too much trouble. Crossing their genes with those of a spider could mean stronger materials that require less energy to produce. This experiment has been tried before, but Professor Don Jarvis’ team’s success lies in the high quantity and strength of silk produced by their squirmy subjects. 
This is not the first time Wyoming’s researchers have experimented with spider genes: Transgenic goats, whose milk contains spider silk proteins, are already breeding on campus.
Currently, the modified silkworms contain only one kind of spider-silk-producing gene and the team hopes to have success with more genes in the future. If it works, spider silk farms might become a new source of materials for greener textiles, plastics and medical implants.

584,Marine Solar Cells Make The Most Of Sun And Waves,https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/03/marine-solar-cells/,2012/01/03,"
In an unusual hybrid, British industrial designer Phil Pauley created Marine Solar Cells that harness energy from both the sun and water. 

The web of energy generators capture energy off-shore, using a combination of floating photovoltaics and natural buoyancy displacement. Thanks to the reflective nature of water, the solar component’s efficiency is up to 20% greater than it would be land-locked. 

The devices can be made using recycled materials and, by attaching the units to underwater mooring, can be placed nearly anywhere off-shore, creating subsea batteries or power plants. 

The technology is currently in concept stage, so you won’t need to dodge them on your next water sport adventure, but it does have the potential to be a substantial source of new energy, especially if installed in turbulent high sea areas.

585,"BP, Shea Ventures, Google Ventures And Others Invest in Cool Planet’s C Round",https://techcrunch.com/2011/12/29/bp-shea-ventures-google-ventures-and-others-invest-in-cool-planets-c-round/,2011/12/29,"
Today, Cool Planet BioFuels, Inc. announced that BP Technology Ventures has made an investment in the company’s C round led by Shea Ventures. Current Cool Planet investors,  General Electric, Google Ventures, ConocoPhillips, NRG and North Bridge Venture Partners also participated.
The amount of funding was not disclosed.
Cool Planet BioFuels is working to develop bio-based, renewable, reduced carbon gasoline that can be blended with conventional gasoline and used in today’s vehicles. The gas, which is chemically indistinguishable from crude oil derived product, can only be detected by radiocarbon isotope analysis.
Here’s how the company describes the process of making its fuel:
Our proprietary biomass fractionator technology extracts useful hydrocarbons from biomass, leaving behind the excess carbon as a high purity solid. The process generates activated carbon with a very high surface area which will allow it to be used as a soil enhancer similar to “terra preta.” By burying this carbon in an appropriate manner, we can greatly enhance soil fertility while sequestering carbon for hundreds of years. In contrast, normal plant decomposition occurs in just a few years, releasing the plant’s carbon as CO2 and even more harmful methane gas. Our process yields about the same amount of carbon as gasoline so, if we sequester this carbon as a soil enhancer, or simply bury it as coal, the associated fuel has a N100 Negative Carbon Rating.

BP, ConocoPhillips and others are currently testing and evaluating Cool Planet’s fuel and the company also expects to announce other strategic relationships in the coming year.
The C round financing was a year ahead of schedule (the B round closed this spring) because Cool Planet wants to speed  up the development of its modular fuel production plants which it plans to mass produce on a production line. Over the next few years, the company expects to deploy hundres of these plants around the country, in order to save on high transportation costs.
The terms of the B round were also undisclosed, but Cool Planet had raised $8 million in 2010 from GE and North Bridge.

Well, it’s that time of year again when families come together to stare moodily at each other over lunch and, in theory at least, we’re supposed to be thinking about others less fortunate than ourselves. To that end, stay you hand before you switch off the office PC and head off for some seasonal shopping. For those CPUs could be put to good work for charity, no less.
The Charity Engine is a non-profit volunteer computing grid. Based on Berkeley University’s BOINC software for grid computing – as used by dozens of famous ‘citizen science’ projects such as SETI@home. Charity Engine’s version of BOINC simply donates what it makes from research projects on its grid and donates the cash to charity, while incentivising users with randomly generated cash prizes. Profit from the commissions from science and industry is shared 50-50 between the charities and prize winners. You can use the invite code for the beta: CRUNCH.

587,Google Puts $94M In Solar Projects; Clean Energy Investments Nearing $1B In Total,https://techcrunch.com/2011/12/20/google-puts-94m-in-solar-projects-clean-energy-investments-nearing-1b-in-total/,2011/12/20,"
Google is ending 2011 with an investment that brings its total of renewable energy investments to an impressive $915 million. The online search and advertising juggernaut this morning announced that it is pumping $94 million in a portfolio of four solar photovoltaic projects being built near Sacramento, California by a solar development company called Recurrent Energy. 
From the blog post announcing the equity investment (PDF):
We’ve already committed to providing funding this year to help more than 10,000 homeowners install solar PV panels on their rooftops. But this investment represents our first investment in the U.S. in larger scale solar PV power plants that generate energy for the grid—instead of on individual rooftops. These projects have a total capacity of 88 MW, equivalent to the electricity consumed by more than 13,000 homes.
The facilities will serve serving the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD). 
Construction on three of the Sacramento area projects will be completed in early 2012, with the fourth coming online later in the year, Recurrent Energy says.
The solar development company, as well as global investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (through a new venture dubbed SunTap Energy), are co-investing in the projects alongside Google.

Remember when Greenpeace totally didn’t like Facebook and its use of ‘dirty energy’ in its datacenters? Well, they’re best buddies now. Greenpeace and Facebook this morning announced that they’re teaming up on the promotion of renewable energy and “develop programs that will enable Facebook users to save energy and engage their communities in clean energy decisions”.
Facebook also committed to using clean and renewable energy to power its own operations.
The news comes two years after the global campaigning organization launched its Unfriend Coal Campaign, enlisting online activists to call on Facebook to power its data centers with clean energy instead of coal. That campaign ends today.
Marcy Scott Lynn, of Facebook’s sustainability programme, said it looked forward “to a day when our primary energy sources are clean and renewable” and that the company is “working with Greenpeace and others to help bring that day closer”. 
As part of the agreement between Greenpeace and Facebook, the social network behemoth committed to the pursuit of “ongoing research into energy efficiency” through the Open Compute Project, which Greenpeace will also work to support.
Greenpeace says it is currently the most ‘liked’ environmental nonprofit organization on Facebook.

590,A Look At The Organizations That Grabbed $115 Million In Grants From Google In 2011,https://techcrunch.com/2011/12/14/a-look-at-the-organizations-that-grabbed-115-million-in-grants-from-google-in-2011/,2011/12/14,"
As you may have heard, Google is getting into the holiday giving spirit these days, as it late last night announced that it has dished out an additional $40 million in philanthropic grants, targeted at science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), girls’ education, and even fighting slavery. (You can read more in Google.org SVP Shona Brown’s blog post here.) 
These grants brought the total that Google has funneled into nonprofit and academic institutions over the course of the year to $115 million — and that’s on top of the $1 billion the company invests in programs like Google Grants, Google Apps for Education, which offer free support and services to non-profits and educational institutions.
As part of the $115 million in philanthropic grants awarded over this year, Google has funded 16 programs in STEM and “girls’ education” (nine of which are in the U.S.) for a total of $14.7 million. These programs include the Tech Museum of Innovation, the D.C. Public Education Fund, Girl Scouts of Northern California, the Computer History Museum, Boston-based Citizen Schools, and U.K.-based Generating Genius. The rest include:

Platform Bèta Techniek
Bletchley Park Trust
Concord Consortium
Girlstart
MateFitness
Roberta Initiative
Robin Hood
Teach For All
Science Gallery
World Wide Workshop

In support of girls’ education, Google also dished out funding to the African Leadership Academy, which “provides merit scholarships to promising young women”, as well as across the continent, and the Afghan Institute of Learning, which brings literacy to the young women of rural Afghanistan. Others include:

CAMFED International
Free the Children
10×10: Educate Girls, Change the World
Omega Schools Foundation
Akili Dada

Google also awarded 14 grants to recognize “the entrepreneurial spirit” behind companies using the Web, open source programming, and other tech platforms to improve access to information — something Google has obviously long been passionate about. These include companies like Vittana, which offers loans to students with great credit history in the developing world, Code For America, which received a grant of $1.5 million in an attempt to help governments become more transparent, connected, and efficient by connecting web developers to leaders in civic services.
DoSomething.org also received $2 million in funding to help connect mobile and wired teens with causes they care about, as well as Switchboard, a company that helps African health care works connect with local mobile providers to create free networks and communications channels. The other 10 organizations include:

Fundación Cibervoluntarios
Fundación Ciudadano Inteligente
Engineers without Borders Canada
iLab Liberia
Inveneo
Mercy Corps
Public.Resource.Org

Samasource (TC coverage here)
Stanford University, Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law
Team Rubicon

The last portion, $11.5 million, was apportioned to organizations that will help free people from modern-day slavery, which you can read about here. 
There are some amazing companies in this list of grant recipients, and Google has clearly spent more than a little time researching some of the more inspiring and big-picture-minded non-profits and technology companies operating out there today. Sure, this is just the season when Google spends some time promoting its charitable grants, but if you have a few minutes, it’s worth checking these organizations out. There’s a lot of value here.

595,"Mint Founder’s New Project, Swift, Studies Personal Maglev Vehicles",https://techcrunch.com/2011/12/04/mint-founder-maglev-vehicles-swift/,2011/12/04,"
Aaron Patzer, the founder of Mint, has a new project that he is spending half his time on (he continues to spend the other half as VP of Product Innovation at Intuit, which acquired Mint two years ago for $170 million). His new project is called Swift, and it is his vehicle (if you will) to exlore the feasibility of building a personal maglev vehicle transit system.
“The goal is to see if I can develop a new transportation system to displace cars in most urban and suburban settings,” he told me recently, “with the goal being 5x the speed, and bringing the cost of maglev from today’s costs of $50m / mile down to $4-5m / mile, which would be the same as adding one lane of asphalt/concrete road.  Not sure if it will pan out, as I’m deep in the science and simulation phase.”
After a lot of analysis and setting up some simulations, he figures that he can built a system with two-person “pods” hanging underneath maglev rails which will operate at the equivalent of 800 miles-per-gallon, at 3 to 4 times the speed of regular cars.  But even that will not be enough to displace cars.  He’s concluded that the numbers don’t pan out.  And he just shared his findings in an extensive blog post.  It has all sorts of details on his concept and how it would work, but here is the conclusion:

While a 3-4x velocity improvement, 800+mpg energy efficiency, and 3-4x reduction in cost over light-rail systems, it’s not enough to displace cars.  The future of transportation is still the concrete and asphalt road, for the simple reason that at $17 per tonne of asphalt versus $900 per tonne of steel or $10,000 per tonne of copper, roads are the only thing cheap enough to be ubiquitous in lower density areas.  Not even the ultra lightweight track of Swift looks cheap enough to displace roads outside of dense urban areas where, because it uses a much smaller rolling stock (number of vehicles) and can have higher throughput, mass transit is likely a better approach.
If roads are the future, then so is the self-driving car, functioning like an on-demand taxi system, connected into a centralized traffic database to avoid congestion and minimize time, and driven by computers in a platoon formation of 5-10 cars to minimize aerodynamic drag by up to 35%.
It is quite possible the same system-level traffic engineering algorithms developed at Swift can be used in such a self-driving system.  That said, Swift PRT as a maglev concept will be abandoned.  No track-based system (not maglev, not light-rail or metro systems) can compete with the cost and ubiquity of roads for population densities below 5000 people / km2.

It looks like those self-driving cars Google is developing might not be such a crazy idea after all. I hope Patzer figures it out. These are exactly the kinds of big, world-changing ideas startup founders should be tackling.

596,Bus/Tram Combo Charges Battery As It Picks Up Passengers,https://techcrunch.com/2011/12/03/bustram-combo/,2011/12/03,"
German researchers are testing a unique form of public transportation that borrows the best from busses, electric cars, trains and trams without contributing emissions. The vehicle, named AutoTram, is fully electric, but instead of running on a single charge, it charges when it stops, gaining enough power in 30 seconds to move another mile.
The project comes from the  Fraunhofer Institute for Transportation and Infrastructure Systems IVI in Dresden and aims to offer the convenience, routing flexibility and affordability of a bus, minus the noise and exhaust. It also addresses the problem of lengthy battery charging cycles. While most cars are only in use for a few hours per day, public transportation vehicles can be in action around the clock, offering nearly no battery charging opportunities.
The streetcar is partly inspired by light rail systems, but doesn’t require rails or overhead lines, making it less expensive to implement. Instead, AutoTram’s tires follow white lines painted on the road and a multi-axle steering system gives it the maneuverability of a regular bus.
AutoTram stops would jolt supercapacitors in the vehicle with 700 volts during its brief stops.  The team decided against using lithium-ion batteries, which are heavier and require more time to charge. A diesel generator also rides on board to serve as a back-up in case the next charging station is too far.
According to the team, AutoTram’s costs would be 30 to 50 times less than those of light rail systems, although still pricier than diesel-powered busses. The project is supported by 34.5 million euros from the German Government’s Economic Policy Program.

597,Google Gives Up On Green Tech Investment Initiative RE<C,https://techcrunch.com/2011/11/23/google-gives-up-on-green-tech-investment-initiative-rec/,2011/11/23,"
Among yesterday’s service shutdowns at Google, which included underperforming and deprecated Web properties like Knol, Wave and Gears, there was also news of the end of RE<C. What’s RE<C? Just one of those ambitious “we can save the world with Google money!” type projects that gave the search giant the appearance for caring about more than the influx of ad dollars. In this case, RE<C was focused on lowering the cost of renewable energy. Or, as the acronym indicates, to make “renewable energy” (RE) less than (cheaper than) coal (C).
As it turns out, that was easier said than done.
RE<C was announced back in 2007 by Google.org, the philanthropy arm of Google. The company made several investments in companies in the greentech/cleantech space, including Brightsource Energy, eSolar, and the geothermal drilling innovators Potter Drilling. The project’s funding helped sponsor research that was used to develop the first Geothermal Map of the U.S.
A $10 million equity investment in Brightsource through RE<C was also put towards the development of a type of concentrating solar power technology called the solar power tower which works using a field of mirrors (heliostats) to concentrate the rays on the top of the tower.
What’s interesting about the RE<C project, is how unceremoniously it was lumped in with duds like “Knol” (Google’s wannabe Wikipedia) and outdated tech like Google Gears (a stopgap solution for the pre-HTML5 days). Unlike those abandoned Web technologies, RE<C represented a not-so-insignificant source of investment in the green tech space.
When the initiative was announced in 2007, Google said it expected to spend “tens of millions on research and development and related investments in renewable energy.” And that was only the beginning. Google also claimed that it anticipated investing “hundreds of millions of dollars in breakthrough renewable energy projects which generate positive returns.”
Over RE<C’s run, Google.org invested over $10 million in Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) technology. However, outside of RE<C, Google invested $38.8 million in wind farms developed by NextEra Energy Resources, and an undisclosed amount for a 37.5% equity stake in the Atlantic Wind Connection (AWC) backbone, which aims to connect to 6,000 MW of offshore wind turbines in the Atlantic Ocean.

To date, the company says it invested over $850 million in the renewable energy sector, and only around $30 million of which came through RE<C. The renewable energy projects in total were capable of generating 1.7 GW of power and the electricity equivalent of that used by 350,000 homes. Other investments have included $280 million in Solar City, $157 million in a wind farm in the Mojave, $100 million for Oregon’s Shepard’s Flat wind farm, approximately $5 million for a solar facility in Germany, $75 million to create a fund with Clean Power Finance (CPF) and others listed here.
Google also poured $168 million into the world’s largest tower project – Brightsource’s Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System (ISEGS), now set for completion in 2013. The tower will generate 392 MW of clean solar energy.
It is unclear to what extent this level of investing will continue with the shuttering of the RE<C initiative, which Google Co-founder, now CEO, Larry Page once spoke of so highly:

We want to apply the same creativity and innovation to the challenge of generating renewable electricity at globally significant scale, and produce it cheaper than from coal. With talented technologists, great partners and significant investments, we hope to rapidly push forward. Our goal is to produce one gigawatt of renewable energy capacity that is cheaper than coal. We are optimistic this can be done in years, not decades.
If we meet this goal, and large-scale renewable deployments are cheaper than coal, the world will have the option to meet a substantial portion of electricity needs from renewable sources and significantly reduce carbon emissions.
We expect this would be a good business for us as well.

Sadly, it seems that some $850 million later, Google doesn’t think green tech is a good business after all.
Update: This article was updated to clarify that NextEra and AWC were investments outside of RE<C. Additionally, a Google spokesperson says “we remain committed to the renewable energy sector and we plan to continue investing to add to our over $820 million in energy project investments.”

598,Coda Automotive Taps GE To Sell Chargers Alongside The Coda Sedan,https://techcrunch.com/2011/11/17/coda-automotive-taps-ge-to-sell-chargers-alongside-the-coda-sedan/,2011/11/17,"
Well, it looks like Coda Automotive — makers of the zero emissions all-electric Coda Sedan — and General Electric (a name that requires no introduction) have teamed up to sell the Coda Sedan and the GE WattStation Wall Mount EV Charger in the same retail outlets. 
Many of us are already feeling that a shift toward electric vehicles is the responsible decision, but a change that big means replacing and changing huge chunks of our lives. A brand new all-electric vehicle means you’ll be remembering to plug in every night instead of stop by the gas station on your way to work. It also means you’ll need a charging station. Thanks to this deal between Coda and GE, you can pick up a charging station at the same time you buy your new all-electric Coda. 
The GE WattStation Wall Mount is a Level 2 EV charger, meaning it offers between 208-240V, rather than the 110V provided by the Level 1 Chargers. Level 3 chargers, on the other hand, are used for commercial use at gas stations and provide a super quick charge. The higher the level, the faster the charge. It’s not the most exciting bit of news we’ve ever heard, but it could help grow EV adoption which we’re all for. 
In related news, the price of the Coda Sedan has gone down to $39,900, making it just a tad more expensive than the Chevy Volt and a good $4,000+ more pricey than the Nissan Leaf. Then again, the Coda Sedan touts a range of up to 150 miles on one charge, whereas the Leaf gets a max of 100 miles per charge. The Volt, of course, is a hybrid and can thus run forever as long as gas is in the tank to charge the generator. But on EV mode, the Volt will only offer about 30-40 miles per charge. 
Many owners will probably qualify for a $7,500 tax credit, which would bring the price on any of these vehicles down significantly. Then again, we’re seeing a pretty big push in the automotive industry toward electric, so you may want to hold out and see what’s in store.

Many in motoring are looking forward to an all-electric future, but as long as we’re burning fuel we’ll need to keep incentivizing low emissions. In California, a limited number of low-emissions vehicles are given stickers that let them travel in the HOV lanes, which residents know is a hell of a perk. Now Volt owners can get in on that action.
Chevrolet is making a low-emissions package standard in Californa for the 2012 model (which we’ll be testing soon), making owners eligible to apply for one of the stickers.
The new Volt has a modified catalytic converter that helps reduce the tailpipe emissions, and of course it goes for around 35 miles without producing any emissions at all. So it’s a fairly clean little car.
This also makes the Volt eligible for a $1500 California clean vehicles tax credit. On top of the $7500 federal credit that takes a lot of the bite out of its sticker price, though that could certainly be lower as well.

601,Apple Addressing Pollution Concerns In China,https://techcrunch.com/2011/11/16/apple-addressing-pollution-concerns-in-china/,2011/11/16,"
Apple met with leaders of five environmental groups in China yesterday to discuss pollution concerns. According to a report from The Wall St. Journal, Apple told the groups it had launched audits of 15 of its suppliers who have been suspected of violating environmental regulations, and has completed reviews of 11 of those.
The details of the meeting were confirmed by Chinese green activist Ma Jun, who serves as the director of the Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs based in Beijing. Another environmental group director, Li Li of EnviroFriends, was also present at the meeting. Both leaders were relatively happy with the outcome of the discussions, as Apple was taking the right steps to address the issues at hand.
Mr. Ma told the WSJ that Apple had asked the companies accused of polluting to take corrective actions and give a timeline, but Ms. Li thought Apple could do more. Details on what she meant by that were not provided, however. Apple also said it would take environmental issues into consideration when it awarded future contracts, according to Mr. Ma.
Apple PR, in typical Apple fashion, declined to comment on the meeting.
Outside of the pollution concerns, one of the criticisms Mr. Ma had for Apple was its lack of transparency. He felt the company should name the suppliers under investigation and the suppliers themselves should have to disclose the steps they are taking. “Apple is trailing far behind in terms of transparency and pushing for the polluters to be held publicly accountable for their problems,” he said.
Apple’s annual supplier report  for 2011, released in February, stated that Apple took corrective actions on 80 facilities that weren’t storing hazardous material properly and 41 that weren’t disposing of or recycling waste properly. But again, it didn’t list either the companies or the violations.
Lack of transparency is a common complaint from environmental organizations when it comes to Apple. For example, in Greenpeace’s 2011 Apple report card (Nov. 2011), the group notes that Apple’s Suppliers Code of Code of Conduct states that “suppliers shall comply with the most recent version of Apple’s Regulated Substances Specification, 069-015 and with any applicable laws and regulations prohibiting or restricting the use or handling of specific substances.”
But Greenpeace notes that’s it’s impossible to evaluate Apple’s communications with its supply chain on hazardous substances because Apple won’t disclose its Regulated Substances Specification.
Overall, Greenpeace gives Apple a 4.6 out of 10 across all its environmental sectors, including areas like energy use, green products and sustainable operations. Says Greenpeace, “Apple would score more points on the other criteria with greater transparency of its data in reporting the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) of its supply chain and disclosure of the documents it uses to communicate with its supply chain for chemicals management.”

602,7 Seats? In A Sedan? Tesla’s “Flat-Pack Battery” Model S (TCTV),https://techcrunch.com/2011/11/14/tesla-flat-pack/,2011/11/14,"
Rear-facing car seats used to come at the expense of the trunk. That’s because a giant combustion engine had to go somewhere. But that was before Tesla invented the “Flat-Pack battery”. Laid along the bottom of the car, the Flat-Pack lets Tesla’s new Model S sedan keep the trunk while seating 7 and travelling up to 300 miles on a single charge. Oh, and it has a 3G 17-inch touchscreen computer for navigation, media, internet, and apps. The Model S won’t be on the market until July 2012, but at last week’s GigaOm RoadMap conference I got to play around in an Alpha version shown off in this TCTV video.



Most EVs are actually just combustion models with an electric battery crammed in. That means less cabin or trunk space. Even Tesla’s Roadster was built off of a 2-seater Lotus body. But for the Model S, Tesla built a brand new frame with the battery laid along the bottom, taking up 2/3s ofthe length and the entire width of the car. The rear-facing seats that fold out of the trunk were said to come at Tesla founder Elon Musk’s behest, as he has 5 sons under the age of 10. The Flat-Pack even doubles as a structural element that lends strength and rigidity to the car.
The exceptional roominess afforded by the Flat-Pack comes in handy when rocking out to the Model S’s home brewed sound system. I swore it was a Bose at first, but Tesla built it in-house, and it’s got some serious thud. The entertainment system, along with car controls, navigation, and a new application platform are all housed in the 17-inch touchscreen in the center of the dashboard.
The computer runs an intuitive custom OS built by Tesla, and will come with a 3G or 4G connection for speedy map downloads, media syncing, and web browsing. It’s even a wi-fi hotspot. The dash also includes support for Tesla’s new app platform that will let the company and potentially any developer create apps for locating grocery stores, predicting traffic, or offering tour guide tidbits. Cars could become the next big app platform, and Tesla has a big head start.

The technology inside the Flat-Pack gives the Model S exceptional range. The baseline $57,600 version can travel as respectable 160 miles per charge, and there;’s a mid-level 230 mile option. For closer to $100,000, though drivers can get a 300 mile version that can travel over 3x farther than cars from Tesla’s major competitors.
Tesla communications manager Camille Ricketts tells me “We think Flat-Pack is the future of our brand, we’re going to adapt it for our future models”. At this point, Tesla biggest problem is that the EV consumer base isn’t growing as fast as it or environmental advocates want. Just 10,000 Nissan Leafs have been sold to date. Tesla’s got a plan for that too. Ricketts tells me Tesla’s now planning a $30,000 electric vehicle to appeal to the mass market..

603,Electronic Flowerpot Takes The Guesswork Out Of Gardening,https://techcrunch.com/2011/11/13/electronic-flowerpot/,2011/11/13,"
Even though plants need only a few things to grow – water, air, light and minerals – maintaining the right proportions can make gardening feel like a high-maintenance hobby. Estonian company Click & Grow creates soilless, electronic flowerpots that do the work for you, providing the correct water and nutrient balance for indoor plants.
For some, this may seem like a superfluous product since many varieties of houseplants don’t require an excessive amount of care. But for those with a history of killing their flowery friends, or those whose travel schedules don’t permit regular waterings, Click & Grow could be a helpful solution.

Each flower pot is wired with sensors, a processor and software that checks on the plant and provides it with fertilizer and water as needed. Each pot uses a combination of hydroponics and aeroponics, and still requires an occasional refilling of the water reservoir, about once a month.
A light on the flowerpot illuminates when the reservoir requires refilling, and the pot uses a pump to nourish the roots over time. While the pot takes care of water and fertilization, it’s up to the owner to find suitable lighting. The company recommends indirect sunlight.

The 59 euro (just over $80) starter kit contains a pot, four AA batteries and a plant cartridge embedded with flower seeds. Batteries last about eight months, and when the first plant completes its growth cycle, you can swap in another cartridge for just under 7 euro ($9). Each cartridge sprouts about two weeks after activation and contains software that helps optimize the system for each species. Current options include several flowers, a basil mix, tomatoes and chili peppers.

604,Nest To Ship 1st Batch Of Sold-Out Smart Thermostats Tomorrow,https://techcrunch.com/2011/11/10/nest-ships/,2011/11/10,"
The initial run of of Nest’s artificial intelligence thermostats will be shipped out to pre-orderers tomorrow, said Nest founder and CEO Tony Fadell at GigaOm’s RoadMap conference today. Previously the company had said the devices wouldn’t ship until the end of November. Users are so desperate for the home heating revolution that the devices have sold out and are back ordered. Those who’ve since reserved their units may not receive them until February 2012. Fadell says Nest has ceased taking orders until it can catch up.
At the conference, Fadell spoke of several of the innovations in the company’s device. It will analyze the thermal decay of a house to determine how long it takes for heat to dissipate. This helps prevent it from continuing to expend energy if the warmth of daylight will return before the house cools down. An “Auto-Away” feature uses far-field motion detection to assess whether no one is in the house for a few days, perhaps because you’ve gone on vacation. If so, the unit goes into low-energy mode.
The Nest thermostat also tracks your manual heating adjustments. For example, it can learn that you turn off the heat when you leave for work in the morning and turn it back on when you return in the evening, and then start to automatically make these changes for you. Fadell explained that “Absolutely I’d call it AI”, and these he’s proud to count a world expert on machine learning from Carnegie Mellon as a team member.
When asked what about the Nest development process made him cry, Fadell lamented that they spent so much time designing their unit but that the problems start with”the thing this attaches to. There’s 40 to 50 years of heating ‘technology'” with a with a wild variety of different wire and voltage standards that Nest has to try to be compatible with. Tomorrow, Nest can expect the start of an influx of customer service inquiries from buyers trying to connect their next generation thermostats.

605,Meet BMW’s New All-Electric i3 SUV And Hybrid-Electric i8 Sports Car,https://techcrunch.com/2011/11/09/meet-bmws-new-all-electric-i3-suv-and-hybrid-electric-i8-sports-car/,2011/11/09,"
 



Because our resident automotive enthusiast Matt Burns up and decided to go camping this week, I was lucky enough to attend BMW’s sneak preview event in NYC today where I got a first look at two new eco-friendly vehicles: the BMW i3 and i8. Referred to as mega-city vehicles (or MCVs if you will), both are built with the urban driver in mind, capitalizing on green features and stability. The all-electric i3 is really more of a compact SUV, while the hybrid-electric i8 is a sexy little sports car.
We were lucky enough to get a hold of Richard Kim, external designer for both vehicles, who details the what and why of these new cars. A couple key points he made is that the vehicles are much lighter than your average car, thanks to carbon fiber-reinforced plastic materials used for the cars’ frames. The i3 and i8 have also been created from the ground-up, as opposed to electric or hybrid-electric vehicles that are merely conversions of existing models. In this way, the assembly and design of the i3 and i8 are much more efficient, with bulky batteries laying flush along the bottom and the “life module” seamlessly sitting on top.
You’ll see this in the video but it’s certainly worth reiterating that these are two of the most futuristic vehicles I’ve seen. There’s more glass than you’ll know what to do with (though it’s unclear how all that glass will do in a crash), and a nice hint of BMW’s i blue along design lines, seat belts, and lights makes for a streamlined and sporty look to complement BMW’s elegant style.
As far as range goes, the i3 and i8 are very different. The all-electric i3 will offer between 80 to 100 miles per charge, however BMW knows how much range anxiety affects consumers and provided a solution. The i3 has an optional range extender (or REX, as BMW calls it) which uses gas and motor to offer an additional 80 to 100 miles. However, the gas and motor are merely running to further charge the battery, rather than power the wheels of the car.

The i8, on the other hand, is a hybrid-electric vehicle, meaning it features both an electric motor along with an internal combustion engine. You’ll see around 20 to 30 miles per charge out of the i8, but when paired with the internal combustion engine that expands to about 300 miles combined.
I know, I know… it all looks and sounds great. But patience is the name of the game here. We won’t see the all-electric i3 until 2013, and the i8 will follow after in 2014. Pricing has yet to be announced.

607,Bill Gates On “The Miracle Of Availability” And Applying Computer Science To The World,https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/27/bill-gates-on-the-miracle-of-availability-and-applying-computer-science-to-the-world/,2011/10/27,"
Bill Gates just gave a talk at the University of Washington’s School of Computer Science and Engineering. As is typical of his talks, this one was broadly focused on new and helpful implementations of technology. It was followed by an open Q&A session.
There was nothing radical or new proposed or revealed, but Gates was smart and compelling as usual, and the highlights of the talk are below. Video of the talk should be available soon from UW.
I’ve tried to directly quote Bill as much as possible (bolded for those hungry for sound bytes), but there may be small errors in phrasing. If it’s in quotes, they’re his words, though I may need to correct a few words here or there.
“Maybe I’d have been more rounded if there weren’t as many books around”
Gates began by establishing his computer science credibility, not that it’s necessary at this point, by reminiscing about the early days of computing. He recalled that at UW, “at strange hours you could essentially break in and steal computer time,” on the batch-work computers of the day like the B5500. This served as a segue, actually, to his initial thesis, which was that people like himself aren’t the ones who will bring be making the next generation of breakthroughs happen.
He cited the incredible amount of storage and its almost negligible cost, and how as someone who grew up with kilobytes and megabytes, he simply isn’t ideologically suited for allocating terabytes and petabytes. But people who have grown up with it do things like, for example, suggest that every lecture at a university be recorded and stored. Once he got past the prejudice of someone who wants to save every byte, he said he thought “it’s actually kind of absurd that we’re not doing that.”
The big advance, Gates said, is “the miracle of availability.” This is the change that happens when something goes from being a device owned by the elite and wealthy of the world to being something utilizable by the poorest. An example given later was the sophisticated GPS-driven combines used on US farms. Ingenious, but can you build one that an African village can afford?
As a further example, he showed off an application using the Kinect which I actually highlighted back in August. Not that it would be useful to a starving child, but there is a huge potential just waiting to be unlocked, as Microsoft Research and innumerable hackers have shown for the Kinect and other devices.
“Many problems in society are just poorly designed algorithms”

Gates praised alternative models for education, showing off a program for teaching algebra that actively monitored how the student was doing, what methods of teaching worked, and adjusted the lessons on the fly. We saw some other ideas along this line with the Imagine K12 companies, which I’m sure Gates would appreciate if he is not already aware of them.
He also spoke in glowing terms of Khan Academy, which we’ve featured here quite often. But, as he later elaborated during the Q&A session, it’s not meant to be a substitute for learning institutions. “As you go from kindergarten up to college, certainly the need for adult supervision hopefully goes down somewhat. But remember education to some degree is about motivation.” He noted that some 20 schools had completely reorientated their curricula around Khan Academy and similar services, with the teacher assigning the lectures and quizzes to be watched on the student’s own time, and then using the classroom not as a lecture hall, but as a discussion platform that added context, clarified points, and offered more one on one time for students who couldn’t grasp the material.
As for adding computer science to the curriculum as early as elementary school, he was skeptical: “I think the computer is a great tool and you should use it as much as you can. But hash tables and database indexes, I don’t know where that would come in… It’s hard to say anything is necessary in the curriculum. Personally, I’d have more people take statistics than calculus.”
But though he spoke lightly of it, he really considers education one of the highest priorities. When asked how he felt about political discourse and the concentration of wealth, he responded that, to put things in perspective: “the world at large is less inequitable today than at any time in history. That is, the poorer countries are getting richer faster than the richer countries are getting richer. So the number of people in abject poverty, percentage of people, is at an all-time low today, and that continues to go down. Innovation will continue to drive that down.” But that said, “It’s not good to have a society where you don’t have mobility between different income levels. If you really look where we’re letting people down as far as the American dream… it would be that we are not providing enough education.”
Without proper education, how can people make rational choices in day to day life, to say nothing of the issues voters face? “One thing I’m worried about is complexity. We can’t talk directly about the issues, so we talk about personalities.” When the most controversial bill of a political era (Obama’s health care bill) is over four thousand pages long and totally unreadable by the average voter, how is that effective?
“I like hash tables and I dislike malaria”
He then moved on to the question of poverty and disease. His primary insight came when he was working with researchers to create a stochastic model of “one of my reactors.” It was immensely complicated but the computing power at their disposal made it possible. He thought, if we can model a reactor, with all these forces and materials, why can’t we model disease, including the mosquitos, the people, the environment, the solutions?
So they worked at it and eventually came up with an immensely complex model for disease vectors, weather, vaccines, life cycles, seasons, and everything else. They compared it with real statistics and it checked out. He said with confidence: “The world effort to get rid of malaria will be based on this model.” And the modeling approach to problems, now that we have the computing power to simulate the world with some precision, is just as important to apply elsewhere. Whether it’s malaria, polio, crops, nuclear reactors, sanitation, or education, “it makes you so much more rational in terms of what you do.”
He demonstrated a few applications of the model and explained quite a bit about the disease itself and some of its history. But you can learn about malaria on your own time.
“It’s the same hamburger”
On the topic of wealth, something in which he must be considered something of an expert, he downplayed the money thing. One questioner asked for advice on getting as rich as him. He took this slightly tactless question in stride, saying that he never intended to become extremely wealthy, and that it was more important to do something you were interested in. He also said that while he understood the drive to make a few million dollars, a level of wealth that provides “meaningful freedoms,” after that amount, “it’s still the same hamburger. Dick’s hasn’t raised their prices enough…” This raised a laugh from the audience, who are probably all too familiar with this local Seattle burger joint.
“All you’re trying to do is put stuff on your eye”
When asked what might come after the change from PC to laptop to smartphone, he was animated: “We’re going to look back and laugh that we had these big glass screens, and if you drop it, it breaks… all you’re trying to do is put stuff on your eye!” As in, it’s just a way of getting information from the world into your brain, via your eyes. He suggested that projection directly onto the retina was likely the next big step, or alternatively a flexible screen of adjustable size.

Lastly, the host noted that it would be Bill’s birthday tomorrow (the 28th), and invited Bill Gates Sr. up on stage, who held a cupcake with a candle for the younger Bill to blow out.

608,Video: This Electric Vehicle “Wears” Airbags For Ultimate Protection,https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/27/video-this-electric-vehicle-wears-airbags-for-ultimate-protection/,2011/10/27,"
A Japanese company called Humanix [JP], in cooperation with Hiroshima University, has developed a small electric car that “wears” airbags on the body. I am not really sure if the result can be called pretty, but Humanix is claiming that (perhaps rightfully) their ”iSAVE-SC1” is the “safest electric vehicle in the world”.
The three-wheeled car offers enough room for three people and comes with inflated airbags on the front and rear, while the body is covered with tent cloth. Upon collision, the idea is that the air released from the bags will soften the impact.

The iSAVE-SC1 reaches a top speed of about 50km/h and can be charged using conventional 100V power plugs.
Humanix is planning to sell the first cars in November (in Japan only) for US$10,400 before starting “mass-production” sometime next year. The company also set up a US unit in April this year in San Francisco.
This video is from last year, but you’ll get the idea:

609,Brammo Grabs $28 Million From Polaris And Others To Power Development Of Electric Vehicles,https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/26/brammo-grabs-28-million-from-polaris-industries-to-power-development-of-electric-vehicles/,2011/10/26,"
TechCrunch readers may remember Brammo as the Oregon-based designer and manufacturer of all-electric motorcycles (and the battery technology and software that powers them), or as the makers of the bike one Mike Arrington was driving around the conference center at Disrupt NYC this year, whereupon he was almost removed from Disrupt by security. Later, in conjunction with Brammo CEO (And Disrupt Speaker) Craig Bramscher, Arrington gave the motorcycle away to one lucky mother of a marine.
Back in 2008, Brammo raised its first chunk of outside investment, an $11 million round led by Chrysalix Energy Venture Capital and Best Buy Venture Capital. Today, the electric vehicle technology company has added another significant piece of change to its vault, announcing the close of the final tranche of a $28 million series B round of financing. 
Gigaom first reported the company’s close of the initial $12.5 million portion of its series B back in September 2010. Today marks the official close. For those still confused, Brammo has raised just under $40 million to date.
The final tranche of Brammo’s second round of investment was led by Polaris Industries and included contributions from existing investor, Alpine Energy, as well as first-time investor NorthPort Investments. Polaris, the manufacturer of snowmobiles, ATVs, and neighborhood electric vehicles, joins the Brammo team as a key strategic partner, providing the electric motorcycle maker with an opportunity to bring its drivetrain technology to new markets.
Bramscher told TechCrunch that he hopes Polaris can be to Brammo what Toyota has been for Tesla. For those unfamiliar, the CEO was referring to Tesla’s strategic partnership with Toyota (forged prior to Tesla’s IPO in May 2010) in which Toyota agreed to purchase $50 million in Tesla common stock, followed by an announcement that the two companies would collaborate to build an electric version of Toyota’s popular RAV4.
Through its new partnerships with the powersports leader as well as its manufacturing partner, Flextronics, Brammo is looking to synthesize powersports and innovative electronics to realize scale and kick its product development plans into fifth gear.
As to these powersport product development plans, Brammo has two super moto and off-road motorcycles (Engage and Encite) coming down the pipeline as well as a sport motorcycle called Empulse, which will add to its existing flagship product, the 2010 Electric Motorcycle of the Year, Enertia — an “urban commuter” motorcycle that runs about $8K per bike.
Furthermore, Bramscher said that its partnership with Polaris will enable the company to broaden its reach in product development, geographic scale, while Flextronics gives Brammo the ability to scale through supply chain optimization and high quality assembly (the company will soon begin producing Brammo Power battery packs), as well as access to design for manufacturing services. 
The new round of funding marks a big win for the up-and-coming EV maker, and we’ll be looking forward to the release of these cool new green bikes soon, especially as Brammo looks to nose out fellow American competitors and all-EV makers, Zero Motorcycles and Mission Motors.

True to the Apple aesthetic it’s one big dial you can spin and push to control a sophisticated array of features.
It’ll be the first thermostat marketed directly to consumers. Can they get excited enough to plunk down a couple hundred dollars? My husband and I are finally putting a new heating system in our drafty San Francisco Victorian. After this demo, I was sold. How about you?

611,"iPod Godfather Tony Fadell Finally Reveals His New Product: A Thermostat. No, Really.",https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/24/ipod-godfather-tony-fadell-finally-reveals-his-new-product-a-thermostat-no-really/,2011/10/24,"
For the last eighteen months, the tech world has been anxiously awaiting news of what iPod godfather Tony Fadell is up to. His staff has been sworn to secrecy since word got out he was leaving retirement to do something new. Despite reporters camping out in front of his office with cameras, the news somehow stayed a secret– no small feat in the ever-leaky land of Silicon Valley.
No doubt the anticipation raised expectations in fan boys’ minds that the next great entertainment or communication device was going to be unveiled by the former DJ who oversaw 18 versions of the iPod and the first three versions of the iPhone.
Fadell is well aware that those fan boys may be in for some confusion or some disappointment today. Because he’s announcing what finally got him to come out of retirement and start a new company: A desire to reinvent thermostats.
That’s not a moniker for some cutting edge game device– Fadell’s new company, Nest Labs, is bringing Apple-level design and cool to the those little boxes on the walls of a quarter of a billion US homes and offices that control the internal temperature. Why? Because all the ones on the market are ugly, they are too hard to use and they control a whopping 50% of the average American home’s energy budget. His goal is to take something we never think about and make it more than just sexy– he wants to make it a “beloved” object in the home.
Fadell got the idea designing his green home in Tahoe. He was shocked there wasn’t a single attractive thermostat on the market so he decided to build his own. The size of the market and the potential impact on the planet convinced him it was a great business. And if he didn’t do it, who would? The unit uses the guts of a smart phone and required someone who knows how to build drop-dead-easy user experiences.
When Fadell left Apple, he promised Steve Jobs he wouldn’t build a device to compete with what he’d done at Apple. Instead, he’s taking the design philosophy to an utterly different industry. Will consumers bite?
We sat down with Fadell for his first video interview about Nest last week. In this segment, he talks about why he feels this opportunity was too good to pass up. Stay tuned for part two of the interview, when Fadell will demo the Nest Learning Thermostat.

San Francisco-based HiGear, a peer-to-peer car-sharing service focused on luxury vehicles, is expanding to L.A. starting November 1st. The move is part of the company’s continued expansion plans that will see it arrive in five additional markets, including Portland and San Diego, by year-end.
Unlike other car-sharing services, HiGear specializes in “high-end” auto brands only, including Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Aston Martin, Lamborghini and Tesla.
Owners of these high-end cars can rent their vehicles to other drivers for fees that are, on average, 50% off commercial rates. Meanwhile, everyday drivers get a chance to finally drive their dream car without the burden of ownership.
HiGear provides comprehensive liability and collision insurance and performs member screening, which includes driving record checks and sometimes even credit checks. It also collects a security deposit in order to “encourage safe and fair use of members’ cars.” In additional to the rental fee ($125-600, depending on the car), drivers pay $20-40 per day in rental insurance. The average rental period is for 3 days, or around $410.
In HiGear’s case, the transfer of keys from owner to renter is not an automated procedure involving lockboxes, but actually has the members meeting up in real life in order to coordinate the transaction. Despite this hassle, the company says it now has an “inventory” of 200-plus cars and is adding new vehicles at a rate of 50-plus per month.
Earlier this month, HiGear raised $1.3 million in seed funding from BV Capital, Battery Ventures, 500 Startups and angles including Zipcar investor Craig Sherman and Kevin Chou.

Changers is today launching its new solar powered gadget-charging system designed to power up your USB devices, including iPhones, iPods, Android phones and Kindles, using a simple, one-button device. The Changers Starter Kit, which includes the company’s “Kalhuohfummi” (TM) solar battery and Changers “Maroshi” (TM) solar module, can generate up to four Watts per hour.
The system has a social element, too. It uploads how much power it has generated to an online energy marketplace at Changers.com where you can compare and share your energy savings with friends.
The solar panel, produced in Colorado, can be attached to any window or sunny surface. And the kit’s solar module can charge the system’s 16-Watt battery within four hours. When powering up your mobile devices, the system is capable of charging them as fast as a wall outlet could, the company says.
In addition, your solar charging data is uploaded online to Changers.com where you’ll actually be able to visualize your energy savings. You can also compare your scores with other community members, or share them with friends on Facebook and Twitter. Those energy savings are turned into “Changer Credits” which can be spent at the company’s retail partners. (At launch, there’s only one so far: Holstee, which sells goods made with recycled materials. 100 Watts gets you $10 on the site).
Changers is now accepting pre-orders for its starter kit, reasonably priced at $149. Only a limited number will be available at first. The company was founded in Berlin, but is launching in the U.S. to attract the early adopters crowd.

614,Solaria Announces Partnership With Service Provider Meteocontrol,https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/18/solaria-announces-partnership-with-service-provider-meteocontrol/,2011/10/18,"
Solar manufacturer Solaria and solar performance monitoring software and hardware provider meteocontrol have today announced a partnership that will see meteocontrol’s Virtual Control Room (VCOM) monitoring system added to Solaria’s projects. The system aims to help Solaria’s customers increase their solar yields through remote management.
With meteocontrol’s VCOM system, developers and utilities will be about to tap into the remote, cloud-based operating system to monitor and manage their PV systems’ performance in real-time.
Solaria, which designs, produces and sells silicon PV modules to solar system integrators, project developers, utilities and other power producers, just this week announced it now offers a new 270-Watt high-performance solar module that’s been optimized for industrial and utility-scale projects. The 1 x 1.9 meter frameless modules, now shipping, are also available in a complete integrated tracker package that combines modules, trackers and design services to optimize system performance. They are just the type of system that would benefit from a monitoring solution like the one from meteocontrol.
The partnership also fits in nicely with Solaria’s goals to improve the economics and system performance of solar installations, while also reducing the complexity of solar operations management.
Last month, meteocontrol partnered with Princeton Solar Solutions (PSS), a N.J.-based solar provider, which is now also using the VCOM system.

615,Zipcar Members Can Now Reserve A Car On Facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/18/zipcar-members-can-now-reserve-a-car-on-facebook/,2011/10/18,"
Car sharing network company Zipcar this morning announced the release of a Facebook application that allows its members to ‘reserve their wheels’ on the popular social networking site without having to leave it.
The Nasdaq-listed car-sharing company warns that the app is being tested in public beta for now. Aside from booking a vehicle, members can also use the app to check car availability, view upcoming reservations and change existing reservations. 
Facebook users who do not yet have a Zipcar account can use the app to find car locations or join Zipcar.
Zipcar says the app was built after member surveys showed that more than 88 percent of its members use Facebook.
The company also offers a mobile website and native Android and iPhone apps.

616,"Facebook, NRDC & Opower To Partner On Energy-Saving Social App",https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/17/facebook-nrdc-opower-to-partner-on-energy-saving-social-app/,2011/10/17,"
Facebook, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and clean tech startup Opower are today announcing a partnership on a new social networking-based energy application that will help consumers monitor, improve and compare their home’s energy usage with their friends and other Facebook users.
The app, designed to improve energy awareness, has the potential to combine the 800 million+ users on Facebook with Opower’s network of over 60 utility partners reaching 55 million U.S. households. However, the social app will start off with just a few participating utilities when it launches in early 2012.
Opower, a software-as-a-service company, currently helps electric and gas utilities understand their customers and how they’re using power. Home owners use Opower’s online applications to gain insights into their usage patterns, set personal goals to reduce consumption and even receive alerts if they’re headed towards a big electric bill at the end of the month. The proactive alerts give customers a chance to reduce consumption before it’s too late.
Now, the new Facebook application will bring some of these same features to the social networking service. Participating users will be able to automatically pull in data from their utility provider in order to benchmark their home’s energy usage against a national average of similar homes, compare their energy use with their Facebook friends, enter energy-saving competitions and share tips on how to become more energy efficient. In addition, users will be able to share their energy use, ranking and group participation to their Facebook News Feed.
The NRDC’s involvement will be to provide additional environmental expertise while also seeking out new partners and encouraging consumer participation.
Commonwealth Edison (ComEd), the City of Palo Alto (Calif.) and Glendale Water & Power (GWP) will be the first U.S. utilities to offer their customers the ability to import usage data into the social energy application. Combined, these utilities offer access to 4 million customers, including all of Chicago’s residents.
The NRDC states that improvements to energy efficiency has the ability to generate $700 billion in cost savings in the U.S. alone, but consumer participation is key to making that change happen. The organization is no stranger to the use of word-of-mouth techniques in this area, going all the way back to its Hood River Conservation Project in the 80’s which, at the time, leveraged real-life social networks to spread word of an energy improvement program. Now it hopes to use word-of-mouth on Facebook’s online network to enact similar behavioral change.
The organizations will formally announce the partnership later this afternoon. More information will be posted to Facebook’s “Green on Facebook” page.

617,Dean Kamen’s Inflatable Wind Turbine Doubles As Digital Billboard,https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/15/dean-kamens-inflatable-wind-turbine-doubles-as-digital-billboard/,2011/10/15,"
Most wind turbines have a recognizable shape, but a new design from Segway inventor Dean Kamen is less obvious in its functionality: This turbine has a vertical axis and rotors made of plastic fabric meant to be easily moved by the wind. 
Archetypal wind turbines require a good amount of steel and concrete to be built, and once installed, it is difficult to move them. Kamen’s design uses air to inflate the rotors, which act as giant sails. The rotors can be easily deflated, making the turbine not only lightweight, but mobile. 
Kamen believes turbine mobility would help owners generate more energy with the ability to toss turbines on trucks when high winds are predicted nearby. This could give rise to a new breed of storm chasers, although questions remain as to how much wind these turbines can handle, and how they would be installed in a temporary location to prevent them from flying away.
In his patent application, Kamen describes how the turbine’s light weight could also allow it to be installed on rooftops that can’t withstand the weight of the steel-and-concrete variety. 
Another unique feature is an LED system that transforms the turbine into a digital billboard. Powered, of course, by the turbine they’re embedded in, the lights could display content like images, messages, advertising, weather advisories and traffic delays, and offer owners another potential revenue stream.
The unusual displays could also inspire conversation about wind power, and awareness is Kamen’s main objective with the design: In his view, the design isn’t so much a green tech breakthrough as it is a different approach to the possibilities of wind power.

618,GE To Build Largest U.S. Solar Factory In Colorado,https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/14/ge-to-build-largest-u-s-solar-factory-in-colorado/,2011/10/14,"
GE has announced plans to spend $600 million on a new solar factory located in the Denver suburb of Aurora, Colorado. The factory, which begins operations in 2012, will be capable of producing enough solar panels per year to generate 400 megawatts of power, or enough energy to power 80,000 homes. When completed, the factory will be bigger than 11 football fields – soon to be the largest factory of its kind in the U.S.
The business will also bring 355 jobs to Colorado plus 100 more positions at GE’s research facility in upstate New York.
The company is retrofitting and expanding an existing 200,000 sq. foot former L’Oreal Worldwide warehouse, a project which will require a $300 million investment. Over the next two years, GE will double the building’s size.
Colorado is already the manufacturing site for GE Energy’s thin film solar pilot line, a joint technology development between GE’s Global Research Center and PrimeStar Solar, a company GE acquired in April. The new factory is located near this smaller, 30 MW facility and a GE solar research center. GE says the location will enable an accelerated start-up schedule with production equipment installation beginning in January 2012.
The new factory will produce thin film solar panels made from cadium telluride, which are cheaper than traditional crystalline silicon panels. It’s the same technology as produced by First Solar, the largest solar company in the world by market cap.
The panels are lighter, which helps ease installation. They’re also large, which helps to lower the total system cost by reducing the amount of racking and electrical components required. Shipments to utilities and commercial customers will start in early 2013, according to the annoucement.
GE’s plan for solar is similar to the one for its wind business, a space the company entered in 2002 – that is, it plans to grow through both technology and scale. GE now has more than 27 gigawatts of wind and solar resources installed around the world.

Software company PlugShare, makers of apps for owners of electric cars, is today announcing a partnership with car-sharing service (and TechCrunch Disrupt NYC winner) Getaround to provide $50 to those PlugShare members who sign up to share their car via Getaround’s service.
The idea, whose launch has been timed in conjunction with the first-ever “National Plug In Day,” is meant to promote peer-to-peer sharing, thought to play a crucial role in expanding EV adoption and infrastructure.
National Plug In Day (Sunday, Oct. 16, 2011) is an awareness-raising effort taking place across over two dozen cities across the U.S., with the hopes of drawing attention to the environmental and economic benefits of plug-in electric vehicles. Plug In America, the Sierra Club and the Electric Auto Association will be teaming up to offer plug-in parades, tailgate parties, test drives and more.
PlugShare’s founders will be at the local San Francisco celebration of National Plug In Day this Sunday from 11:30 AM – 2:30 PM at Chrissy Field, advocating for EV adoption alongside leaders from Getaround and Plug In Day sponsors.
Due to Getaround’s current availability, the $50 financial incentive will only be available to residents in the San Francisco Bay Area and the San Diego metropolitan area.
PlugShare is also announcing the launch of its new Web application, which now joins the iPhone and Android apps as another tool for accessing the large list of public and private charging stations the company maintains. You can preview the Web app here at www.plugshare.com/widget.

This week, GM announced it will launch an all-electric vehicle under the Chevrolet brand, the Spark EV. The car is basically an electric version of the Spark mini-car and will be sold in limited quantities in the U.S., including California, starting in 2013.
The company also announced it has started working on its new concept vehicle, the Chevrolet EN-V.
The Spark EV will be built using feedback from Chevy’s electric vehicle demonstration fleets in Shanghai (Sail EV), Korea (Cruze EV) and India (Beat EV), the automaker states. The car’s nanophosphate lithium-ion battery packs will be provided by A123 Systems. Other than that, details are scarce.

Information on specific markets, range, quantities and pricing are not yet available.
In addition, GM announced that it has begun work on its next-generation EN-V concept car, which will also carry the Chevrolet badge. This car will feature one of those crazy, futuristic designs in the form of a 2-seater, zero-emissions vehicle developed specifically for increasingly crowded urban areas.

The Chevrolet EN-V (short for Electric Networked-Vehicle), will add new features like climate control, personal storage space and all-weather and road condition operation. It will also include elements from the original EN-V, like its small footprint and maneuverability, battery electric propulsion, connectivity and autonomous driving capabilities.

621,Virgin Atlantic To Recycle Steel Mill Pollution Into Jet Fuel With New Tech,https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/12/virgin-atlantic-to-recycle-steel-mill-pollution-into-jet-fuel-with-new-tech/,2011/10/12,"
Not one to shy away from difficult problems, Virgin has just announced that their aviation arm will be partnering with carbon-handling company LanzaTech to spread a new process for cleaner creation of jet fuel. Airplanes are certainly an efficient means of transporting people (more efficient than single-person vehicles, at any rate), but the sheer volume of fuel burned means that any slight improvement could bring about huge savings in costs and emissions.
The new process being promoted by Virgin isn’t actually any cleaner to burn, but the way it’s created is far more eco-friendly.
Essentially what they’re doing is repurposing waste material from other manufacturing plants, steel mills in this case. These mills produce waste gases and other junk that would normally be emitted into the atmosphere. Virgin and LanzaTech will collect these gases at the source and bring it to their facilities, where it is processed and turned into hydrocarbon jet fuel and miscellaneous alcohols (and some waste, no doubt):

They’ll be bringing the necessary retrofitting to steel mills in the UK, New Zealand (where LanzaTech is based), India, and China, and hope to have a “demo flight” in a year or so. They claim the new process reduces lifetime emissions (that is, from production to emission) by 50%.
I wonder whether this really can produce anything like the volume necessary to run a commercial fleet. Not that supplementing dirty-sourced fuel with clean-sourced fuel is a bad thing, but will it be more than a drop in the bucket? Steel, at least, isn’t going anywhere any time soon, so even if it’s a trickle, it’ll add up over time while larger-scale solutions are being pondered.

622,A Ten-Minute Charger For The Nissan Leaf – In Time,https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/10/a-ten-minute-charger-for-the-nissan-leaf-in-time/,2011/10/10,"
One of the drawbacks of current (if you will) electric cars is the rather long time it takes to charge their batteries. We found with the Leaf that as long as you adapt your lifestyle to it a bit, it’s not a problem, but the unexpected happens and it would suck to be at low charge when you suddenly need to get to the hospital, or what have you. Quick-charge solutions are out there, but few are really practical and many still take hours to reach full charge. Nissan says they’ve created one, however, that could charge a car in only ten minutes.
It’s a collaboration with Kansai University in Japan, and the technology breakthrough has to do with the electrode material used, though it’s not clear where in the process the new vanadium oxide and tungsten oxide electrodes are being implemented.
The ten-minute charge uses a new compact charge station that costs less than half what the previous quick charger did, and could also be used on other automakers’ vehicles. Still, at around a million yen (~$13,000), it’s more suited to institutional use. Gas stations, parking lots, that sort of thing. It’s bad enough already that you have to get a 220V adapter in order to get your Leaf back on the road in good time.
The advanced processes and materials used mean that this isn’t likely to be found at your local shop any time soon, though. And of course there aren’t really enough electric vehicles out there to make this a priority just yet. But by doing the theoretical work now, Nissan can be ready with a product when the time is right.

623,How Zerofootprint Uses Data To Make Schools Greener,https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/08/how-zerofootprint-uses-data-to-make-schools-greener/,2011/10/08,"
Editor’s note: Guest writer Joseph Puopolo is an entrepreneur and start-up enthusiast, who blogs on a variety of topics including green initiatives, technology and marketing.
The word “green” is tossed around a lot as a catchall term to describe sustainable or environmentally friendly projects, businesses, energy, and more. Green construction and architecture, for one, are proliferating across the world, but when it comes to gauging how “green” a building is, for example, one finds that there are more than a few standards by which to determine its efficiency and sustainability.
Enter Toronto-based Zerofootprint: A cleantech software and services company, which is leveraging competitive benchmarking between peers to help determine the “green” factor for any given building. Ron Dembo, the founder of Zerofootprint, contends that, if you want to motivate developers to improve the efficiency of a building, one can’t simply benchmark against everyone else, because each community has a different climate. Thus, the founder says that Zerofootprint aims to focus on benchmarking buildings against other buildings within a community to achieve maximum community efficiency.
Zerofootprint uses its mapping and analytics engine to correlate multiple consumption and usage data points, like power usage, costs, emissions, etc., that it then plots on an interactive map for easy viewing. Currently, the company is working with over 100 customers that include entities like school boards and municipalities, and is leveraging its data in school districts to drive change at a school-by-school level.
By tracking power usage at this local level, Zerofootprint is quickly able to see which schools are using higher amounts of power and thus incurring a higher cost. Through some quick analysis, it’s able to track and see that a school board may be paying $2,500 per child in electricity vs. $800 in another school, for example. 
Some of these differences can be traced to age of the building, but another key component is behavior. By sharing this information with key stakeholders (including students, teachers, parents and administrators), the schools can then work to reduce energy costs. It is the hope that by reducing energy costs, school districts can focus on using those funds towards education instead of just keeping the lights on. 
According to Dembo, through realtime feedback with its system, Zerofootprint has already been able to help certain schools achieve 20 percent energy reduction. He also says that it’s been interesting to see the reaction from stakeholders for installations that have not even taken root. Zerofootprint has recently deployed their solution with the Halton Catholic District School board.
“Even in the early stages of this initiative, teachers and principals are excited about using the
Zerofootprint tool to engage students and encourage behavioral change when it comes to energy use in our schools. Our Board looks forward to using this tool to track carbon emissions and strive to continuously improve energy conservation”, says Erin Holko, Environmental Sustainability Officer of the Halton Catholic District School Board.
Time will tell as to what the ultimate impact will be of actively monitoring power usage, but it is clear that they are getting traction from multiple levels of stakeholders. The key will be to see how this translates both in different regions and in both government and the private sector.
As to cost, the minimum for a Zerofootprint installation is $25,000, which pays for the analytics and dashboard that help track the progress within the organization. For many companies with ever growing energy costs, this can help properly identify where the issues are and address them. 
While school boards have been a key client, this is the tip of the iceberg as to who Zerofootprint wants to reach with this technology. The hope is that by empowering multiple stakeholders with information, it will act as a catalyst to spur behaviour change in many sectors and industries. This will not only change how people use power but how people use buildings. With a clearer understanding and correlation of these factors, it hopes to enable administrators to make clearer decisions.
Zerofootprint has been challenged lately by competition from a new company in the space called OPower. But Dembo maintains that it has an edge over OPower, as it has begun to partner with banks to give special financial benefits to those who reduce their eco footprint. In any case, the entrance of OPower into the market is helping to draw more attention to both their offerings, indicating that there is room to grow, as the race to connect the dots between behavior and energy patterns is just beginning. 
The key going forward will be not just the creation of linkages, but identifying which systems truly spur a ground-level change in behavior. Zerofootprint’s key differentiator will be tying performance to financial incentives. Zerofootprint has been courting banks and financial institutions to give preferential rates and products to organizations that become greener. If there were more incentives to operate in a more energy efficient manner, this could be a game changer for green initiatives. By involving real financial incentives, it is more likely to take hold in the mainstream rather than just with those who pursue green initiatives for altruistic purposes.
It is clear that information is the first step to making a decision. Zerofootprint hopes that once information is put in the hands of multiple people, innovation will occur and people will formulate their own solutions to increase energy efficiency.

624,Design Competition Yields Bikes Of The Future,https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/07/design-competition-yields-bikes-of-the-future/,2011/10/07,"
Oregon Manifest, a nonprofit located in Portland, has been running a competition over the last few months in which students and pro teams work to create a next-generation city bike. This isn’t about speed (like the McLaren Venge) or concept design (like the Vienna Bike), but rather about creating a bike that provides the maximum amount of utility for someone looking to ditch their automobile.
These innovation-from-competition events are really blowing up; there have been lots lately aimed at creating everything from mega-efficient cars to electrically-powered aircraft. This one had 34 entrants who mostly had some variation of a cargo bike with electric assist, but they all varied in execution. I have to agree with the people’s choice, though, a collaboration between IDEO and Rock Lobster (pictured).
You can see the other winners here (I like the campus bike and the two-seater), but the Faraday, as the IDEO-Rock Lobster bike is called, really just hit me right in my future bone. Minus some of the slightly retro trappings, I can picture thousands of these crowding the streets. The design is just that well thought-out.
The front wheel has a hub motor powered by that battery underneath the seat there. The battery can be quick-charged at an outlet and are actually the same kind found in the Chevy Volt. The porteur-style front rack has been brought into the 21st century with a removable flat-rack that attaches or detaches in seconds by means of spring-loaded bolts, and the fronts of the support tubes conceal a pair of LED headlights. The rack is mounted on the frame, not the fork, which improves stability. I’ve always been a fan of paniers but this works nicely as well. Reminds me of this bent-wood bike basket. Core77 has a nice design diary for the project, and IDEO has a page for it as well.
It does have some design issues to work out: it’s rather tall, the seat-handlebar relationship is off, and it needs a more potent braking system. But there’s still a weird sort of elegance to the design.
A bike like this for a decent price would go a long way toward replacing cars for many people in the city. Human-powered, compact, and simple, yet able to go long distances and carry groceries. It’ll be a while before they’re really affordable, but the promise of the electric-assist bike, already taking effect elsewhere in the world, seems destined to come to our shores as long as there are people creating things like the Faraday and the other entries to the contest.

According to the latest from the Cleantech Group, a global research firm tracking innovation in the cleantech sector, venture investment in the industry grew 12% in Q3 2011 ($1.98 billion) compared to the previous quarter, and is up 23% since Q3 2010 ($1.81 billion). Worldwide, there were 189 deals totaling $2.23 billion.
In Q2 2011, there were 179 deals, for comparison purposes. Of this quarter’s deals, 59% were Series B or later rounds, accounting for 81% ($1.81 billion) of all investments.
IPO and M&A activity were slower in Q3 compared with the first half the year, the group found, but M&A activity was up from last year. Two acquisitions in the water and wastewater sub-sector were the highlights. These included Ecolab, which acquired water treatment service provider Nalco Holdings for $5.4 billion, and Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing’s Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings, which acquired British water utility company Northumbrian Water for $3.9 billion.
In terms of IPOs, China came out on top, with 11 of the 14 IPOs this quarter. Four of these were for Chinese solar cell or panel manufacturers raising a total of $812 million.
For the first time ever, energy storage was the leading sector by amount invested ($514 million), followed by solar ($350M), and energy efficiency ($223M). Energy efficiency saw the highest number of deals (34), followed by solar (33) and energy storage (19).

A little more than a year ago, we posted about the possibilities of electric aircraft. At the time, we also mentioned an upcoming competition that would test the mettle of these flying batteries: the CAFE Green Flight Challenge. It’s a NASA event (and purse), sponsored by Google, which like the X-Prize aims to fund innovation through competition. Entrants would have to fly 200 miles in under two hours, while using less than a gallon of fuel (or equivalent energy) per passenger.
Tough terms, but 10 teams put their designs in flight in a quiet, efficient battle for the $1.35 million prize.
The competition just wrapped last week, and the winners were revealed at an expo in Mountain View on Monday. The team taking home the big prize was Pipistrel’s Taurus G-4. The four-seater more than doubled the required 100 passenger MPGe, traveling the 200 mile test distance with the electrical equivalent of just over over one gallon of gas, and at an average speed of over 100MPH as well. Here they are holding up their “very large check”:

The runner-up was e-Genius, a two-seater that hit 375 PMPGe. It received $120,000, plus a bonus prize for being the quietest: at takeoff, they recorded only around 60 decibels. That’s probably about as loud as me typing this.
Joe Parrish, NASA’s acting CTO, said that the $1.6 million in funding used to create the competition had generated over $4 million in spending by teams and their sponsors. The winning team, from Penn State (but actually based in Slovenia), vowed to reserve $100,000 of their prize money for a future competition for supersonic electric aircraft. Elon Musk, who has evinced interest in creating such a fantastic conveyance, is no doubt pleased at this development.

627,Car-sharing Startup RelayRides Partners With GM,https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/05/car-sharing-startup-relayrides-partners-with-gm/,2011/10/05,"
General Motors is partnering with a car-sharing startup called RelayRides on a new venture that will allow GM owners to rent out their idle vehicles via the OnStar service and their mobile phone. The program will launch first in California in 2012, before expanding to other markets.
RelayRides, a peer-to-peer car-sharing marketplace lets auto owners choose to rent out their car when they’re not using it, with the car’s owner controlling the rate and availability through the online service.
It’s different from other car-sharing networks like ZipCar, for example, as it doesn’t have its own fleet – all sharing is peer-to-peer. And unlike former TechCrunch Disrupt winner Getaround, the company sends out its own reps to install the device in your vehicles. Now, with the new GM partnership, RelayRides will be able to leverage the built-in OnStar service to unlock the doors, control the engine and track the car. Chevrolets, Buicks, GMC and Cadillacs are all supported.
RelayRides takes 15% of the list price for itself, 20% for its $1 million insurance policy and the remaining 65% goes to the vehicle owner. If the borrower ever wrecks the car, RelayRides handles the insurance claim and your personal policy isn’t affected. Drivers are also vetted first, to verify their driving records are up to par.
RelayRides was founded in June 2010. The company currently operates in San Francisco and Boston. It plans to rollout to additional markets based on consumer demand.

Apple’s new CEO Tim Cook made a lot of strong claims about how well Apple products are doing at today’s iPhone event.  But one of those claims sounded like quite a stretch.
Cook talked about how the iPad is being used in many different places, such as schools and airplanes.  Cook said “in the cockpit, pilots are using it.  They are replacing 40 pound flight bags full of paper manuals and logbooks and navigational charts and checklists, making the pilot more efficient and making the plane more fuel efficient.”  And for emphasis or perhaps the skeptics, he added “Yes, It’s True.”
It is true pilots are using iPads.  In August, TechCrunch wrote about how Delta started in-flight testing. We’ve also covered some of the iPad new navigational software.  These tools clearly make a pilot more efficient.  But, can this really make  planes more fuel efficient?
Instead of carrying a 40 pound flight bag, assume a pilot has a 1.3 pound iPad 2. Let’s be generous and say she doesn’t have one of those smart covers and has even decided to keep her flight bag at home.  The iPad weight savings is 38.7 pounds or 77 pounds with a two-person, two-iPad cockpit.
A heavier plane takes more fuel to fly and less weight does create better fuel efficiency.  But, the numbers per flight are tiny.  What’s 77 pounds when the Boeing 757 maximum takeoff weight is 255,000 pounds.
The FAA says the average weight of a passenger with no carry on bags is about 186 pounds. [pdf] The average child weight is 78 pounds, about the same as the iPad savings.
Jet A fuel weighs 6.8 pounds per gallon.  So the iPad weight savings is worth 11.3 gallons of fuel.  A 757 burns 900 gallons of fuel an hour [pdf], so the weight savings would last just 45 seconds.
But there are a lot of flights.  And those numbers quickly add up.  United Airlines announced in August that it would deploy 11,000 iPads to all United and Continental pilots.  United and its new partner Continental operate more than 21,200 daily flights. The company estimates it will save 326,000 gallons of jet fuel a year.  That’s in addition to 16 million sheets of paper in those flight bags.
According to the airlines, the iPad is making flying more efficient.  Yes, It’s True.

629,Why Did Solyndra Fail So Spectacularly?,https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/04/why-did-solyndra-fail-so-spectacularly/,2011/10/04,"
The spectacular failure of solar manufacturer Solyndra is being held up by some as a shining example of the Obama administration’s failure to properly manage government subsidies after its collapse left taxpayers with $535 million in federally guaranteed loans. But Solyndra’s failure on its own is not remarkable. There are always risks involved when you’re introducing innovation into a commoditized market. The bigger, and still unanswered, question is why did it take this much capital before it failed, given the warning signs?
In commoditized markets, explains Brad Zangler of Pivotal Investments, a firm with numerous investments in the cleantech/greentech space, the challenge is to disrupt the cost of producing energy, not just to create a worthy innovation. In fact, in a business like solar, the go-to-market strategy is just as important as the technology a company is developing. In Solyndra’s case, that technology was a new, unique type of tubular solar panel. The shape itself was an innovation. But the company was also benefitting from another advantage: it didn’t use polysilicon, so it wasn’t affected by the shortages which were hurting its competitors. In 2008, polysilicon was more than $400 per kilogram, but by the time the federal government issued Solyndra’s loan, the prices had fallen to just over $50 per kilogram.
The earlier shortages were obviously going to be a temporary issue, given that new polysilicon plants were in the process of being built, explains Michael Butler, CEO of Cascadia Capital and managing director of the firm’s Sustainable Industries practice group. He says, “any first year economic student knows the price goes down if the supply increases. Which raises the question: “what were they [the government] thinking?”
Zenger agrees, also noting, as did Butler, that the government has smart people working there, which leaves many wondering what happened. Did the due diligence stop? Did they miss key indicators that could have pointed to issues? Did they misinterpret the data they were seeing?
These questions get murkier, thanks to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service (CRS), which now says there were several factors that could have served as warning signs ahead of or shortly after the government investment. These included the price shifts in polysilicon (as noted above), the panels’ inability to work with residential roofing systems or in large solar farms (a key part of the solar market) and increasing competition in manufacturing capabilities from expansions in China and Taiwan.
Solyndra, says CRS, was planning to drive down its costs by scaling up its operations with the government backing, but there was no guarantee that it would be successful. Clearly, it was not.
Perhaps the real issue with Solyndra is not its failure, the politics of how that loan was achieved or the government’s possible oversights of the surrounding risks. Perhaps the failure is an indication of why the government isn’t the best entity to be investing in markets where a winner or loser has to be chosen. The government’s process is not driven by the same market considerations which drive private investors, Zenger explains, and the decision-making has “way more influencers.” No argument there.
As for private investors, Solyndra’s failure doesn’t have much impact on their current investment plans – over the past year, they have been shifting money away from companies dependent on government subsidies, like solar, biomass and wind to other areas like smart grid technologies, energy efficiency technologies, battery storage and transportation.
And the solar stock declines? As Aaron Chew, an analyst with Maxim Group told CNN Money, they have nothing to do with Solyndra. “They’d be here even without that. Solyndra gets a lot of attention for symbolic reasons. But what’s happening is you have oversupply and plunging prices and that’s just being exacerbated by Europe.”
Demand is lower in Europe than previously expected and some governments have cut down on solar subsidies, potentially limiting Solyndra’s ability to sell there.
If anything, Solyndra’s crash shows just how quickly the bottom can fall out in commoditized markets, how easy it is to underestimate how low the price needs to go to gain traction, and frankly, how hard it is to introduce innovation into markets that have existed for years, like energy. Solyndra had the innovations, but it didn’t get to the price point where it could compete, not only with other energy sources, but even with the conventional solar panels it was trying to disrupt.
Private investors are not surprised or concerned by a solar failure – they price it in from the start. And by the time there’s a public failure like Solyndra, investors will have already changed their course. But the bigger problem with the now-politicized Solyndra situation is that it sends out a message that says failure is unacceptable. “That is an absolute mistake,” says Zenger. “We have to fail in order to succeed. We have to try new things.”
Of course “we” should. But when the “we” is the U.S. taxpayer, debates about how much risk is too much risk is going to be hotly debated…for a long time to come.
As for smaller companies trying new things in solar, it may get worse before it gets better. Those with capital may have staying power – like the ones trading on the public market, for example. But more will go bankrupt, allowing survivors to swoop in and buy some interesting technologies and products in the meantime.  The fittest will keep on innovating and be rewarded by the market.

630,More Details On MIT’s “Artificial Leaf” (And Video),https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/30/more-details-on-mits-artificial-leaf-and-video/,2011/09/30,"
Back in March, we heard about a breakthrough from MIT: an “artificial leaf” that produces pure oxygen and hydrogen gas, powered entirely by sunlight. The technology was described in yesterday’s edition of Science, and the team has released a video showing one of the devices in action.
I say device, but it’s really more of a material. There are no moving parts and it has no set shape or size. The leaf is semiconducting silicon, coated on one side with a special cobalt catalyst, discovered by the project’s Daniel Nocera in 2008, and on the other with a nickel-molybdenum-zinc alloy. Sunlight creates a current within the silicon, and the catalyst causes water molecules to split into gaseous H2 and O2, which rise off in bubbles from opposite sides of the leaf.
Take a look at the video. It’s not particular exciting, but it gives you an idea of what kind of conversion rate we’re talking about:

The gases could be isolated and stored in a fuel cell, which could provide power later and produce pure water as its exhaust.
Nocera and several other researchers formed a company, Sun Catalytix, to independently research, apply, and market the artificial leaves, and last year raised $9.5 million from Tata and other investors.
The leaf-like form factor is easy to demonstrate on a human scale, but there’s no reason why the “leaves” couldn’t be microscopic or enormous. The different use cases require much research and testing, however, which is likely what Sun Catalytix is working on at present. That and figuring out to do with the extra protons the process generates. They envision banks of these things powering houses and communities and storing the excess in tanks for sale or emergencies. Also worth noting is the fact that the idea of these devices isn’t new in itself, but Nocera’s work seems to have produced a cheap, durable, and mass-producible one. The efficiency of solar energy conversion still needs to be greatly improved, though.
There’s more information at MIT’s news page, and, if you’re scientifically minded (and subscribe to the journals), the various papers listed on Sun Catalytix’s tech page.

631,Nike VC Arm To Invest In Green Startups,https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/30/nike-vc-arm-to-invest-in-green-startups/,2011/09/30,"
Sports brand and sneaker maker Nike is going to start investing in green startups, through its new VC arm called the Sustainable Business & Innovation Lab. This group will seek out companies focused on sustainable products, sustainable manufacturing and sustainable marketplaces.
The fund is designed to support Nike’s goals involving the integration of corporate responsibility into its business and its evolution to a “closed-loop” business model.
Nike’s focus on integrating corporate responsibility into the company began in 2004, the company explains on its website, and Nike notes in particular the efforts of its “Considered Design” solution, which is focused on making fully closed loop products that are produced using the fewest possible materials, are easily disassembled and ar capable of being recycled into new products or returned to nature at the end of their life.
Throughout FY10, Nike has been sharing its findings in this area publicly in an effort to create industry-wide scale. For example, last winter Nike released its Environmental Apparel Design Tool, which helps designers make real-time choices that decrease the environmental impact of their work.
The new SB&I team aims to further Nike’s goals in this area of sustainability and corporate responsibility, the company says. It includes around 130 people who work with sustainability specialists who are integrated into other parts of the organization including retail, logistics and I.T.
The company has not yet stated how much money the fund will involve, nor has it yet to start its investing.
From a Facebook job posting last year (discovered via PSFK), the Lab was said to have planned investments in two portfolios that would help “accelerate Nike’s sustainability vision and long-term business growth.” The description read as follows:
“The SB&I Lab will use multiple tools, primarily equity investments in early, mid and growth stage businesses. But also, as required, will invest in partnerships and alliances with institutions, governments and NGOs. Depending upon the need and opportunity, the SB&I Lab will serve as creator and manager, sole funder, lead investor, co-investor, general partner or limited partner in operating companies and organizations.”
A more current job posting describes the Lab as involving six teams, all aimed at helping Nike’s to “thrive in a resource constrained world.” While greener products will certainly have consumer appeal, despite all the corporate-speak about “the environment” and “eco-friendliness,” the bottom line for the business is making its products more cheaply.
Nike isn’t the only sports brand getting into VC investing. Adidas also backed its own VC fund earlier this year.

632,"Despite Solyndra, U.S. Solar Up 69%",https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/30/despite-solyndra-u-s-solar-up-69/,2011/09/30,"
In 2010, the U.S. installed 887 megawatts (MW) of grid-connected photovoltaic (PV), up 104% from the 435 MW installed in 2009, according to a new recent report by the Solar Energy Industries Association and GTM Research. However, the U.S. market’s share of global installations fell to 5.1%, down from 6.0% in 2009.
In the end of 2011, that’s expected to change, thanks to slowdowns in major European markets like Italy and Germany. And in a few years time, the report says, the U.S. market may be the largest in the world.
The report looks specifically at PV, or photovoltaics, which are the main kind of solar panel produced. These panels use polysilicon, now in oversupply.
One of the report’s key findings was the increase in grid-connected PV installations in Q2 2011 – up 69% since the same quarter last year and up 17% over Q1 2011. These have now reached 314 MW, or enough to power 63,000 homes. In addition, cumulative grid-connected PV in the U.S. is now at 2.7 gigawatts (GW).

Commercial projects increased by 22% from the previous quarter to account for nearly half of the new installations, while residential projects were about 30% and utility-scale plants were 16%. The commercial trends are expected to continue until 2012, when major non-residential markets (NJ, CA, PA) are expected to see a downturn while residential and utility markets grow. Overall, the report says, 2012 will be a more difficult year for the U.S., in large part due to the end of the Treasury grant program (Section 1603).
Six states in the U.S. installed over 10 MW each in Q2, compared with just 3 states in all of 2007. And, for the first time ever, New Jersey’s non-residential market (excluding utility projects) exceeded that of California’s, making it the largest in the country.

Despite the high-profile failures of companies like Solyndra, Evergreen and SpectraWatt, over 100,000 Americans work in the solar industry, double that from 2009, the trade group’s president Rhone Resch told Bloomberg this week. And on the whole, states the report, the U.S. is the strongest and most stable growth market for PV worldwide.

633,350Green To Add 400 More EV Charging Stations Across U.S.,https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/23/350green-to-add-400-more-ev-charging-stations-across-u-s/,2011/09/23,"
California-based electric vehicle charging station developer 350Green will purchase and install over 400 charging stations from manufacturer Coulomb Technologies, the company has announced. The new additions will be rolled out across the U.S. to help build out 350Green’s network to over 1,000 stations. In addition, the stations will be powered by the ChargePoint Network, Coloumb’s EV-charging infrastructure which also includes online portals for use by hosts, fleet managers, drivers and utilities.
350Green currently has projects in New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana and California. It’s in the process of installing Level 2 and DC Fast chargers in various consumer-friendly locations like Walgreens drug stores and at properties owned by real estate developers like the Simon Property Group, which owns hundreds of malls, outlets and stores across the U.S.
Walgreens had previously awarded a contract to Miami-based Car Charging Group, a move which could indicate that a single EV charging station provider can’t handle an entire nationwide rollout on its own. (Car Charging Group’s stations will also support the ChargePoint Network).
Meanwhile, Coulomb, which charges over 26,000 vehicles in 14 countries worldwide, will be providing its ChargePoint Network services to 350Green’s new stations. The ChargePoint Network will allow 350Green to track revenues, fees, costs, utilization and other EV services. Drivers will be able to use ChargePoint’s 24/7 support, billing options and mobile apps (iPhone, Android, BlackBerry) that offer charging status, plus station location, availability and navigation.
According to a recent report, anywhere from 13 to 40 million plug-in electric vehicles will be on the road by 2030, including models like the Nissan LEAF, GM Chevrolet Volt, Fisker Karma, Tesla Model S, Ford Focus EV and others. Station rollouts like this will be critical to help make the transition more feasible for drivers.

634,Guest post: Identify and leverage your start-up sustainability,https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/21/guest-post-identify-and-leverage-your-start-up-sustainability/,2011/09/21,"This is a guest post by Luke Miller, Founder and CEO of Offset Options, a Barcelona & London-based startup using web services to fight climate change.
The majority of today’s start-ups are focused on making an action, a process, purchase or communications easier, cheaper and more efficient. This efficiency can offer great reduction in environmental impact – for your industry and to your consumer. Being aware of your environmental impact – and the value you provide for customers in reducing theirs – from the early stage enables you to understand how you can build this in consciously so it has the lowest cost and largest benefit.
And the benefits can be huge: attracting new customers and differentiating your company all while helping the environment.
Why should you care? Because big business does and consumers care
According to Boston Consulting Group [Link to BCG Survey: Capturing the Green Advantage for Consumer Companies, 2009 PDF] one third of consumer in both North America and Europe when purchasing look for products which and services which are environmentally sustainable.
Example one: You read The Economist right? Turn to the back of the magazine and check out the ads from Oracle that run each week. This is from last week’s Euro edition:

Large business across the world is embedding environmental requirements into their procurement policies and into KPI’s of modern managers; this means if you can address environmental issues you will not only have the latest solution for the decision maker to sign off on, but make it even easier for them to sell internally. Saving time, money and environment is an even easier sell.
If you are competing with big business, they are generally slower to move in a new technical, policy or mentality direction, so this is a way for you to add further differentiation to your business. This is not simply about your servers, although using the least emissions possible for your servers is great thing.
Google and Facebook are already doing interesting things in this space, and the jury is still out on Cloud computing.
Review how your process leads to more sustainable outcomes for your customers. 
An example is Garmz.com (rebranding as Lookk.com). (Disclosure: Garmz is part of the Seedcamp portfolio, as is my company.)
Garmz focuses on generating demand for a product for independent designers before they have a production run. This means that there is less risk for the designer, however also means there is less waste because demand is assured before creations are produced. Establishing feedback mechanisms between demand and supply is a great step in the fashion space, which generally has exceptionally wasteful production and shipping processes.
Airbnb. You all know them. This is a great service that had its first bump recently. An obvious benefit of this service is social interaction with someone in the location you are visiting – however this is also a great example of resource reuse.
Hotels are seldom at full capacity normally around 2/3 in good times. Moving towards models of greater resource re-use for residential infrastructure now looks like an obvious idea, however has significant environmental benefits. People are leasing properties, a room or a foldout couch that would otherwise go unused. With the explosion of international travel with low cost airlines, more people want an interesting way of travel at reasonable cost without a socially sterile hotel.
There is not a great deal more power used in shared space, it does require the building of extensive additional infrastructure (did you know the concrete industry is one of the highest polluting relative to the size of its industry? Around 5% of global emissions. Wow indeed. According to our estimates, on average Airbnb would reduce the emissions from residential stays by a minimum of 65% compared to standard stays.
Still don’t see how your business fits in? 
Even if you’re not directly leading to energy or process efficiencies, there could be a role for you in providing information to help your corporate clients or consumers to be more informed and make better decisions. If your service is there to help, then go above and beyond your competitors to explain the environmental impact of a decision you may facilitate.
A clear space where this happens in your everyday life is travel. Many online travel agents and travel meta search companies are embedding environmental data in the decision flow for customers. One of our new clients, rome2rio, is not only providing new information about alternative ways to arrive at a destination (such as ferries or trains in addition to planes), they’re including information about the carbon footprint of the trip to empower their customer to make a more informed decision.  Consider whether you can offer a similar value to yours.
Don’t  get left behind
Be proactive or expect to have to try and catch up with your competitors who will move first. This is a key difference from previous generations of entrepreneurs. This data is now available. This is an opportunity available today that will make your business more competitive while reducing your environmental impact.
So if you are an entrepreneur proving how you are more driven and provide more value than your competitors, don’t forget to embed environmental efficiency into your service offering. This is not simply an “add-on” it should be a part of the strategy of any up and coming entrepreneur.
Lead the way, or more importantly let your customers lead the way, by helping them to reduce their environmental impact and make better decisions – working together for better services that also address the greatest moral challenge of our time.

635,GM And China’s SAIC Motor Corp Partner On Electric Vehicles,https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/21/gm-and-chinas-saic-motor-corp-partner-on-electric-vehicles/,2011/09/21,"
SAIC Motor Corp., Ltd. Chairman Hu Maoyuan and General Motors Co. Chairman and CEO Dan Akerson signed an agreement this week to jointly develop a new electric vehicle architecture in China. The components and vehicle structures will be built in Shanghai, at the companies’ joint venture, The Pan Asia Technical Automotive Center (PATAC).  The cars will be sold in China under the Shanghai GM and SAIC brand names.
In addition, the architecture will also be used by both companies to build electric vehicles around the world.
This is the first electric vehicle architecture to be co-developed by GM and SAIC, although the companies are involved in 10 other joint projects in China, with a focus on vehicle and powertrain manufacturing, sales and aftersales, automotive engineering and design, automotive finance and telematics and the sale of used vehicles. They also jointly developed the Sail electric concept car last year, which was designed at PATAC.
Under the new partnership, GM will contribute its knowledge of electric car design and engineering combined with SAIC’s knowledge of the local market in China.
The impact of the new deal will be felt further than China, however, as the terms of the deal allow the companies’ to use the jointly developed technology for their own purposes. By teaming up, they’re able to get more electric cars into the market, and faster than if they went on their own. That means more electric cars will be coming at a critical time when government regulators are pushing for tougher emission and fuel consumption guidelines, both in China and elsewhere.
No additional details or timing of product launches are available at this time.

636,Solyndra Execs Won’t Testify At Congressional Hearing,https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/21/solyndra-execs-wont-testify-at-congressional-hearing/,2011/09/21,"
Executives at the now-bankrupt solar manufacturer Solyndra won’t testify at the Congressional hearing which is looking into allegations of improper dealings between the green tech company and the White House. Solyndra CEO Brian Harrison and CFO Bill Stover have announced they will plead the Fifth during questioning, on advice of their legal counsel.
The company, the first to be financed by the government’s stimulus plan, has left taxpayers on the hook for $535 million in federally guaranteed loans, and is being held up by some as a high-profile example of President Obama’s failure to properly manage government subsidies.
Solyndra first applied for its loan in 2006, during the Bush administration, but was not awarded the funding until 2009, under Obama. The President also came to the company’s Fremont plant in May of 2010 (video), praising the company as innovative example of how green tech could bring new jobs and aid in the country’s economic recovery.
Fifteen months after receiving federal funding, Solyndra shut down its plants, laid off workers, and was the subject of an FBI raid, due to the questions surrounding whether it had misled federal officials regarding its financial situation. With the public failure, the U.S. Department of Justice is looking into how this company was awarded the funding in the first place.
The largely Republican House Energy and Commerce committee believes there could be a link between the White House’s decision to grant the loan and the involvement of Obama fundraisers George Kaiser, whose family was Solyndra’s biggest investor, and Steve Spinner, a top official in the Energy Department. Although Spinner’s role in the Energy Department was to oversee the $25 billion in government-backed loans, Spinner was not involved with the Solyndra decision specifically because his wife’s law firm represented the company.
The White House claims that Solyndra’s failure was created by a drop in prices and demands for solar panels, however. It denies that Solyndra was given the loan for political reasons. Solyndra itself cites heavy competition from Chinese solar panel makers, which drove down its prices.
Even though Solyndra’s top execs are choosing to not answer direct questions at the upcoming hearing on Friday, the hearing is still being held. McDermott Will & Emery, the firm representing Solyndra in the hearings, says it advised its clients not to talk, due to the ongoing Department of Justice investigation.
“This is not a decision arrived at lightly, but it is a decision dictated by current circumstances,” Walter F. Brown Jr., the lawyer for Solyndra CEO Brian Harrison wrote in a letter to Congress.
“On September 8, 2011, federal agents executed a search warrant at Solyndra’s facilities. Moreover, the United States Department of Justice has initiated an investigation into Solyndra,” he said. Energy Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R.-Mich.) and Rep. Cliff Stearns (R-Fla.), who chairs the oversight and investigations subcommittee, retorted via a statement, “who exactly are Solyndra’s executives trying to protect and what are they trying to hide?”
“We have many questions for Solyndra’s executives on their dealings with the Obama administration, their efforts to secure federal support for a project that appeared doomed from the outset, and why they made certain representations to Congress regarding their dire financial situation just two months ago,” the statement read.

637,Solar-Powered Bulb Provides Light After Dark,https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/16/nokero-solar-power-bulb/,2011/09/16,"
A solar-powered light bulb may sound like an oxymoron (what’s the point of a lightbulb that only works when the sun’s out?), but a company called Nokero has a prototype in the works that will charge a battery in the light bulb, making it useful after sundown.
Denver-based Nokero, short for No Kerosene, hopes to offer a safe light source to the millions living without a reliable energy supply. Common non-electric light sources such as candles, charcoal, wood and kerosene are a major health threat when regularly used indoors because of the fumes they produce.

Candles and kerosene are also often relatively expensive to attain and Nokero estimates up to 20% of a family’s income in places without reliable electricity can go to purchasing candles and lighting fuel. Nokero hopes to provide an affordable and lung-friendly alternative.  Priced around $20 and reducing the need for fuels, the company says its bulb begins saving most families money within 3-8 weeks.
The company’s design comes in the form of a lantern that can be hung or placed on a table. The N200 model bulb contains four LEDs and is charged through an embedded solar panel connected to a NiMH AA size battery with a two-year lifespan. The power switch on the back of the bulb can also change the intensity of the light, from high to low, and the bulb itself is made from a durable polycarbonate similar to that used in automobile headlights.

The company is partnering with non-profits to help distribute the bulbs both nationally, such as to off-grid citizens of Navajo Nation, and internationally to countries including Haiti, Pakistan, Mexico and Japan.

638,Ghost Town To Be Built As A Green Tech Test Bed,https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/15/ghost-town-as-green-tech-test-bed/,2011/09/15,"
An uninhabited playground for green tech and innovative experiments is in the works to be built in New Mexico. The pseudo town will be used to research and test new green tech, wireless and traffic technologies in real-world-but-controllable conditions, like a Sim City minus the citizens.
Washington, D.C.-based Pegasus Global Holdings, an international technology testing firm, is behind the project, known plainly as The Center for Innovation, Testing and Innovation. The company was inspired by their own needs to test products on a large scale outside of the lab. 
While there have been similar government-sponsored testing grounds built, this is one of few created by a private corporation. According to Pegasus, it will also be the world’s largest. 
The Center will mimic an average mid-sized American town of 35,000 (invisible) people. It will contain about 20 square miles of old and new commercial and residential buildings, suburbs, rural satellite towns. Pegasus expects to spend $200 million to complete the project.
Pegasus will lease its blank slate of a city to a variety of organizations, including the military, non-profits, university scientists, private companies and federal labs, and The Center hopes to attract investors to projects tested at its facilities.
The project will allow for controlled testing in a setting truer to life than a typical lab. Researchers will be able to control and change setups to fit the needs of their experiments. For example, a solar technology developer might set thermostats in nearby homes to different temperatures to study their units’ energy delivery capabilities. 
When it opens, The Center is expected to create 350 jobs in New Mexico, and as many as 3,500 more in other parts of the country as the project gains steam. Its business plan centers around selling energy produced on site to the grid, charging maintenance and operation fees and subleasing land for commercial and tourism development.

Meteocontrol North America, a global provider of solar performance monitoring software and hardware, bankable energy yield reports, technical due diligence and operations management services for photovoltaic installations, has partnered with Princeton Solar Solutions (PSS), a top N.J.-based solar provider.
PSS provides services including project development, cost analysis, design/build consultation and more, for private, government and utility grade systems.
As a result of the partnership, meteocontrol’s software called “Virtual Control Room” will be used to gain better insight into PSS’s projects. This multi-screen Web application will handle operations management and performance monitoring for the installed systems. In addition, meteocontrol’s WEB’log will be used to provide real-time data and alerts to monitoring teams, who can quickly react to problems and take proactive measures to optimize solar production.
The PV (photovoltaic) plant engineers will be able to use the new software to access operational data and control solar performance using either their computers or mobile devices from anywhere they have a Internet connection.
PV systems produce energy for 25 years or more, which is why performance monitoring tools are so critical. The U.S. is the world’s fastest-growing solar market, with an increasing demand for systems such as these.
Meteocontrol currently monitors more than 3.3 GW across 22,000 PV systems. PSS, meanwhile, is responsible for the design, procurement, construction and/or monitoring of 239 MW of large-scale solar PV systems.

641,Farmville For Real Farming: Grow The Planet Launches Social Network To Teach You To Grow Your Own Food,https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/13/farmville-for-real-farming-grow-the-planet-launches-social-network-to-teach-you-to-grow-your-own-food/,2011/09/13,"
The number of vegetable gardens is skyrocketing, and organic food and healthy eating are also on the rise. There are more than 70 million gardens in the U.S., which is generating a potential multibillion dollar market. A new startup launching at TechCrunch Disrupt today, called Grow the Planet is hoping to take advantage of this opportunity by making a Farmville for the real world. Grow The Planet wants to be a social network for hobby farmers –- and a resource that can teach anyone to grow their own vegetables and herbs. 
The startup’s site aggregates information on plants and vegetables, offers growing skills and techniques, hints and tips for needed activities to become a personal farming resource. Through the site’s social functionality, users can share opinions or growing advice, connecting to each other and even exchanging produce. Grow The Planet is also location-enabled, allowing users to view a map to see what users are close, what they’re growing, and pops down (instead of pins) tomatoes and other veggies so you can see what produce is available around you. And, hey, even offer a neighbor a snack of cucumbers.
However, the core of the platform lies in the possiblity for each user to design their own vegetable garden, on their balcony or indoors, and receive tips on what is needed to grow vegetables according to the season, climate zone, weather, etc. The startup brings in extensive research on growth statistics and the integration with climate data and user input to add breadth to the platform. 
While the startup offers peer-to-peer functionality, users can also keep their own garden journal to keep track of their progress on their way to veggie victory, schedule and keep track of activities, to-do’s and the overall state of their garden (and of course share that progress with the internal community as well as over other social networks). 
So many people would love to be able to grow their own garden, but don’t know where to start. Foodies are are already rabid about their farming, and there really seems to be a lot of potential here to foster a passionate user base. Am I right green thumbs? 
Because of national laws, people can’t sell their own crops, but through this sort of exchange network, Grow The Planet has found a really smart workaround. As to how the startup will make money? The founders said that, in the long run, they want to become an online gardening store; but for now, Grow The Planet is offering premium memberships that offer a fuller array of recommendations, tools, the ability to integrate with hardware censors, and extended knowledge and support.
Grow The Planet is really hitting on an incredible idea here, and it’s so nice to see a startup that’s not simply trying to be the “Airbnb of — some other space”. It’s creative, and we won’t be surprised if these guys are attracting the attention of investors.

642,"Simple Energy Raises $900,000 In Seed Funding",https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/13/simple-energy-raises-900000-in-seed-funding/,2011/09/13,"
2011 Boulder TechStars graduate Simple Energy has raised $900,000 in seed funding from a group of angel investors, including David Calone, managing director of Jove Equity Partners, and Dean Mathew, the former director of Duke Energy’s VC arm, among others. The company says that the new funding will be used to further develop its product, add enhanced features and integration, and hire additional programmers.
Simple Energy, which offers an interactive, social gaming platform for utilities to engage customers in energy-saving behavior, recently teamed up with San Gas and Electric (SDG&E) to offer an energy-saving contest that will reward top savers with real-world prizes, including the Apple iPad and gift cards to local retailers.
During the contest, the utility’s customers are pitted against each other to see who can save more energy by making changes to their home, like weatherizing doors and windows, sealing air leaks, adjusting thermostats, switching to energy-saving lightbulbs and more. Using data from the home’s smart meter, SDG&E will measure year-over-year energy consumption (kWh) of the participants for three months.
It’s this kind of program and the engagement it creates that prompted his investment, said David Calone, managing director of Jove Equity Partners. “I’ve seen first hand the need for utilities to successfully engage their customers in saving energy. And that is why we’re so excited to be a part of helping Simple Energy deliver its engaging solutions to utilities.”
Other investors in the round include Bart Lorang, Brett Jackson, and Five Mill Ventures.

643,GE And Others Invest $22 Million In Green Builder Project Frog,https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/08/ge-and-others-invest-22-million-in-green-builder-project-frog/,2011/09/08,"
GE is leading a $22 million investment in San Francisco-based green builder Project Frog, which helps speed up and reduce the cost of traditional construction by using a combination of new technologies. The company improves on current methods by combining semi-custom designs with a pre-engineered kit of energy-efficient building materials. The end result are building that use at least 25% less energy than the strictest building codes in the U.S., and as much as 80% less energy in some parts of the country.
GE was joined by other investors including Claremont Creek Ventures, Greener Capital Partners and RockPort Capital Partners, but the investment amount for each participating firm was not disclosed.
In addition to the creation of the prefab materials, Project Frog also performs advanced 3D modeling to analyze buildings in each location. This process allows customers to optimize their building kits for the greatest energy efficiency.

Project Frog’s kits take one to six months to produce – less than half the time as required for traditional construction – and are delivered to project sites ready for assembly. This helps keep construction costs down while finishing projects more quickly than before. Typically, projects take 6 months, says the company.
The new investment will be used to expand Project Frog’s sales, execute on orders and will help pay for the installation of one of the company’s prefab buildings at GE’s Learning Center in Ossining, N.Y.
Project Frog was one of the winners of GE’s smart grid challenge in June, which awarded 10 startups with ideas on how to reduce energy usage $63 million to split.

644,Can Municipal Waste Power Our Cars?,https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/03/can-municipal-waste-power-our-cars/,2011/09/03,"
One future source of green energy may be as close as the nearest dumpster thanks to companies vying to make fuel from trash. Enerkem, based in Montreal, and Fiberight, in Maryland, hope to turn municipal waste into energy in new biorefineries.
Enerkem has been around since 2000 and owns several facilities in Canada. Its pilot plant, in Sherbrooke, Quebec, turns used electricity poles into methanol, acetates, ethanol and syngas.  Future plants will use municipal waste as a feedstock.
Recyclables are sorted out of the waste and the remaining material is heated to 750 degrees Fahrenheit until it emits hydrogen-rich gas. Carbon dioxide and other impurities are removed from the gas, and a catalyst turns some of the hydrogen into methanol, which can be further processed into ethanol. The heat created during the process can be used to create electricity or boil water.
Fiberight, founded in 2007, focuses on producing cellulosic ethanol. In addition to municipal waste, the company makes energy out of materials such as road fiber and fire retardant panel board.
A future Enerkem plant, in Edmonton, Alberta, will rely on an annual 100,000 tons of the city’s municipal solid waste to produce 10 million gallons of ethanol and methanol.
Alberta’s government is supporting the plant with a $23 million grant, and Alberta Energy is pitching in $3.35 million as well. Oil giant Valero and trash experts Waste Management are both investors in the company. Enerkem hopes to open a plant in Mississippi with the help of $50 million from the U.S. Department of Energy and an $80 million loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Biorefineries using waste to make fuel may not make a huge dent in landfills anytime soon, but if successful, they could help reduce the amount of garbage that goes to waste.

645,Simple Energy And San Diego Gas & Electric Team Up To Encourage Conservation Through Gaming,https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/02/simple-energy-and-san-diego-gas-electric-team-up-to-encourage-conservation-through-gaming/,2011/09/02,"
2011 Boulder TechStars graduate Simple Energy is teaming up with San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E) to help the utility engage its customers in energy conservation efforts.
To accomplish this, Simple Energy is running an energy saver contest that offers a social gaming experience with real-world rewards.
The contest is in collaboration with the White House’s recent smart grid announcement, which detailed a number of new initiatives meant to accelerate the modernization of the U.S.’s electric grid through the use of smart grid technologies.
In the case of the Simple Energy contest called “Biggest Energy Saver,” the idea is to make energy saving a fun game where customers compete against their neighbors to waste less, and subsequently lower their electric bills.
Using data from the home’s smart meter, SDG&E will measure year-over-year energy consumption (kWh) of the participants for three months. Customers can “compete” by making changes to their home, like weatherizing doors and windows, sealing air leaks, adjusting thermostats, switching to energy-saving lightbulbs and more.

Participants are also encouraged to visit www.biggestenergysaver.com, where they can join with others in an online community to talk about smart meters and how to use smart technology to reduce their electricity consumption, control their electric costs, and help the environment.
The contest is sponsored by GRID 21, a new non-profit organization committed to engaging electricity customers in reducing consumption. During the course of the 3-month challenge, daily top savers are entered into drawings for $25 gift certificates to local stores, monthly savers can win an iPad 2 and the “Biggest Energy Saver” of them all wins a gaming laptop worth $1,500.
It does seem to be a bit odd that the energy saving contest awards energy-gobbling gadgets as prizes instead of something like discounts on new insulation or weather strips, for example. However, those awards clearly reflect the desire of today’s electricity-using households to fill their homes with more and more devices, which, in aggregate, help put a strain on the grid.
Teaching the early adopters of smart meters, who are also likely to be the gadget-obsessed top power consumers, how to better save energy may not be such a bad idea.

646,Environmental Watchdog Report Calls Apple To Task For Violations,https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/31/environmental-watchdog-report-calls-apple-to-task-for-suppliers-violations/,2011/08/31,"
The ever-volatile issue of the costs surrounding globalized manufacturing looks to be looming again as a harshly critical report on Apple’s Chinese suppliers gains visibility. The report, by environmental NGO the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE), is the sequel to another they released in January entitled “The Other Side of Apple.” With the ominous title it’s clear what their intention is, and while there is a certain slant to the presentation, the facts highlighted are too salient to ignore.
I have written about our conscious abdication of moral responsibility for our purchases (Our Great Sin), but the IPE report resurrects the question of corporate responsibility in an era of increasing transparency.
Should we, and can we, hold Apple and others like it to account for the transgressions of those with whom it does business?

You can download the report in English or Chinese here; I’ve also embedded it at the bottom of the post.

First, the obvious must be acknowledged: that this report set out with the intention of exposing, not to say slandering, Apple and its suppliers specifically by publicizing information unlikely to be disclosed by any of the parties involved, such as the health problems of schoolchildren adjacent to certain factories. It also must be said that the violations highlighted are not exclusive to Apple, Foxconn, or China. The report is candid regarding this and gives reasons for why they are singling out Apple.
Not that we can’t think of good reasons on our own for an increased level of scrutiny: as perhaps the world’s largest and most influential electronics company, Apple is a natural target for industry watchdogs and reformers. Furthermore, its policy of limited disclosure is ill-adapted to an era in which information wants to be free, even if it must be tracked, trapped, and released into the wild.
The report is worth reading for anyone interested in this topic, or anyone curious about the environmental conditions surrounding Chinese factories. I don’t think there are many who imagine a shining paradise with sparkling-clean factories churning out ethical iPhones and recycling the scrap into inspirational sculptures, but it’s nice to get a reality check now and then regardless. If you’re in a hurry, just read the “executive summary,” from which I quote (selectively):

Apple  has  systematically  failed  to  respond  to  all  queries  regarding  their  supply  chain
environmental violations.
We  have  found  from  this  investigation  that  the  volume  of  hazardous  waste  produced  by  suspected Apple  Inc.  suppliers  was  especially  large  and  some  had  failed  to  properly  dispose  of  their  hazardous waste.
From these two investigations, the coalition has discovered more than 27 suspected suppliers to Apple that have had environmental problems. However, in the ‘2011 Supplier Responsibility Report’ published by  Apple  Inc.,  where  core  violations  were  discovered  from  the  36  audits,  not  a  single violation  was based  on  environmental  pollution.  The  public  has  no  way  of  knowing  if  Apple  is  even  aware  of these problems.

The report continues with the documentation of their and others’ investigations into the environmental problems specific to inadequate regulation and disclosure. The cost at large of industry (i.e. pollution, injury, etc.) has been known for centuries, of course, but a rigorous on-site investigation turns up things that one would expect to find in Apple’s audits. Some of the data is anecdotal, but much of it has to do with discrepancies between what is reported, what is really happening, and indeed what is even being looked for. Along for the ride (and providing the photos accompanying the report and this article) was well-known Chinese environmentalist Ma Jun.

Familiar tactics are on hand: venting the most hazardous chemicals at night, nominal compliance totally unchecked by regulators, resolutions by local governments that go nowhere, and health problems among workers and locals probably but not certainly linked to the factories. These are things you’ll find in practically every country, but they appear to be running rampant among the big Chinese OEMs.

And it is perhaps this fact, the ubiquity of industrial waste and its halo of destruction, that has resulted in lopsided regulation by Apple. Following a rash of suicides and a number of reports on the conditions of laborers in Apple’s supplier factories, Apple has been careful to publicize its Supplier Responsibility Report (PDF), which details their audits and responses. As you can read for yourself, the “core violations” are almost entirely labor issues. Environmentally, it appears that the companies Apple contracts with are the very pattern of compliance:

(the left column of numbers indicates practical compliance, the right column policy compliance)
And this report seems to directly contradict that. However, it should be noted that the rules being complied with are not exactly disclosed, and that high number may have more to do with inadequate Chinese laws and regulation than laxity on Apple’s part. After all, if Shenzhen ordinances permit however many tons of waste cyanide and heavy metal runoff, they are within the law despite the harm that may do to the environment or surrounding population. The same may be said for many factories in the US.

Yet it’s not often we hear about Intel factories causing chest pains among nearby kindergarteners. And the news that their chemical waste volume had risen 27% in one year came not from a watchdog agency but from their own report.
Indeed, the IPE’s report goes to some length to establish that while Apple’s responsibility may not extend to scrubbing toxic alkalis off seabirds, they do not seem to be following the example of some other large tech companies, which have taken steps to improve the visibility of environmental violations and corrective actions. Siemens, for instance, has begun asking their suppliers to publicly disclose solutions being enacted regarding violations. The rest of the industry is no beacon of hope, though, as many of these shady manufacturing operations contract with Motorola, Samsung, Panasonic, and the rest of the usual suspects. The multi-tiered supply chains of practically every electronics manufacturer are extremely difficult to monitor, but the difficulty is directly proportional to the size and extent of that company’s involvement. But Apple’s deliberate policy of non-disclosure, or to be kind, of selective disclosure, is at worst criminal and evasive, and at best a poor standard to set for the industry.
What is it we can do to improve the situation? Shedding equal light on the environmental impact of globalization as on the economical and humanitarian impacts is a start. It’s been done desultorily for decades, but the gruesome realities consequent on the world’s appetite for gadgets and such is hard to face, harder to address, and at any rate lacks the flash and instant appeal of a Foxconn worker jumping to his death following a management dressing-down. It’s easy to comprehend and easy to decry, but the broader tragedy of thousands of lives lost to cancer and anthropogenic desertification doesn’t fit so easily in a blog post, or the short international news section of the local paper.
But perhaps the timing of this report is auspicious. While Steve Jobs may or may not be staying on in a detached yet powerful fashion, the new face of Apple is Tim Cook and it may be that he can be prevailed upon to make the changes Jobs wouldn’t, or couldn’t. Or as the eye of the public, fatigued with the denigration of humanity that accompanies industrialization, shifts towards the environmental impact of massive companies like Apple, perhaps Apple’s eye will shift as well. Could next year’s Supplier Responsibility Report strengthen and impose rules regarding environmental responsibility? Or Apple and the others fail again to take action on these problems, which are pernicious to solve, easy to pass on to others, and have the agreeable side effect of reducing manufacturing costs?
Environmental groups can issue reports like this one, and I am lucky enough to be in a position to help at least expose our readers to this information, however they should choose to interpret it. Apple produces the world’s most popular devices, and are on track to become the world’s most valuable company. It behooves them to lead the industry in more than just interface and industrial design. We may not have the backbone to opt out of their products, or the products of other companies making similar mistakes, but it’s consistent with our inviolable brand loyalty to hold our favored companies responsible for problems as widespread and poorly addressed as this.

647,Ford And Zipcar Partner On Car-Sharing Program For Universities,https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/31/ford-and-zipcar-partner-on-car-sharing-program-for-universities/,2011/08/31,"
Ford Motor Company and the leading car-sharing network Zipcar have just announced a partnership that establishes Ford as Zipcar’s largest auto source for Zipcar’s University program. The new, two-year alliance will reach students at over 250 university campuses here in the U.S.
Ford will start shipping its vehicles, primarily the 2012 Ford Focus and Ford Escape, to colleges starting this week.
Zipcar says that it will add 650 Ford vehicles this academic year and up to 1,000 during the life of the agreement. In addition, thanks to Ford, Zipcar will begin offering $10 off its $35 annual membership fee for the first 100,000 new University program members who sign up for Zipcar. It will also offer $1 off the hourly rate for the first 1 million hours of use on any of the Ford cars on select campuses, bringing it down to $7.50 per hour.
While the Ford Escape (an SUV), isn’t the most fuel-efficient car in Zipcar’s lineup, the Ford Focus, which gets 40 mpg (highway), is a better fit for students looking for a more environmentally friendly ride.
Scott Griffith, chairman and CEO, Zipcar, says the alliance will help Ford and Zipcar prepare the next generation of drivers for “the future of urban transportation.” And by that, he seems to mean the idea of renting a car instead of buying one.
“We’re targeting a generation that only knows how to buy music by the song so paying for a car by the hour is a natural for them…” Griffith says.
Ford, however, sees the move somewhat differently. For many of these young drivers, Zipcar is their first experience behind the wheel. And when they finally choose to leave the program to buy a car of their own, they will (hopefully) be considering a Ford, the auto maker believes. It’s also why one of the cars provided, the Focus, includes high-tech features like the MyFord Touch and SYNC systems – things that have appeal to the smartphone-toting, always-connected young adult market.
Zipcar’s University program has been in operation for 8 years. It has partnerships with universities such as Harvard University, Yale University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University, the University of Southern California, the University of California – Berkeley, Loyola Marymount University, Florida State University, the University of Michigan, Michigan State University, George Washington University, and others.
The network has over 605,000 members in total and over 9,000 vehicles in the U.S, Canada and the U.K. College rentals account for around 10% of Zipcar’s business.

648,EnergyHub Launches Energy Management System For Consumers,https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/30/energyhub-launches-energy-management-system-for-consumers/,2011/08/30,"
Today, EnergyHub launched its new, comprehensive, in-home energy management system for U.S. consumers. The system includes the EnergyHub Home Base, for centralized management of the electricity usage in the home, as well as The EnergyHub Thermostat, Sockets and Strips.
The Home Base also connects to the Web via Wi-Fi, allowing users to remotely manage individual components via Web-based or mobile applications that run on iOS and Android devices.
The new system is notable not only for its ease-of-use – just plug in your devices, and you’re ready to go – but also because it’s now available outside of a utility-sponsored program.
Previously, the company sold its hardware to utility providers, who then installed the devices in customers’ home. Today’s launch of a direct-to-consumer offering democratizes access to these same energy monitoring systems and tools.

The EnergyHub Home Base is the central station for interacting with the home’s connected devices, where it displays your current and projected energy use on its colorful touchscreen. Here, data is tracked in real-time, and you can program various usage parameters in order to control energy usage automatically.
There are also modes called “At Home,” “Goodnight,” and “Away” that let you program various configurations that can be enabled with just one touch.
The system’s Wireless Thermostat lets you track and manage your home’s heating and cooling systems, while EnergyHub Sockets, Strips and Heavy Duty Controllers let you monitor individual appliances.
The Home Base comes in two versions: ZigBee and ERT-compatible, which refers to two common radio types used by smart meters. (This video helps explain which one is right for you).
And when you’re away from home, the EnergyHub Web-based and mobile apps help you switch between the various modes and remotely control appliances.

EnergyHub pricing is as follows:

Home Base + Thermostat  – ZigBee version: $299.99 / ERT version $389.99
Starter Kit (Home Base + Socket + Strip) – ZigBee version $324.99 / ERT version $414.99
Starter Kit + Thermostat – ZigBee version $399.99 / ERT version $499.99
Sockets, Strips, and Thermostats are also available individually for $39.99, $89.99, and $99.99, respectively

EnergyHub raised $14.5 million in a Series B round last week, as two new investors, Acadia Woods and the New York City Investment Fund, joined existing investors .406 Ventures and Physic Ventures. The funds will be used to support commercial deployments and the launch of the new Mercury wireless thermostat software service.

649,The Long Hard Road To The Edge,https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/27/the-long-hard-road-to-the-edge/,2011/08/27,"
A Year In The Life Of An Entrepeneur
1. July 2010: Ready: Set:  Delaware, the state with the lowest highest point. David Argentar, a biochemist by training and bioinformaticist by trade, has launched a startup. Of sorts. Well – more of a hobby, he’d be the first to admit. He has no business plan, no investors, no employees. All he really has, in fact, is an idea and a pending patent. And as everyone is eager to tell you these days, ideas are a dime a dozen, and patents are practically a scam.
It gets worse. Much. His idea is hardware. A new kind of solar concentrator, to be exact, made mostly of water. His first version was too heavy; but he thinks his redesign could conceivably, in his wildest dreams, drive down the cost of solar power by quite a lot. But—come on, now, really—a hardware startup? With only one founder?
Hardware is hard. It allows for no binary abstractions, no digitized purity to protect you from the real world. It is the real world, in all in its vicious and unforgiving glory, perpetually at the mercy of a hundred unexpected environmental factors. And almost by definition it is incredibly expensive to develop. I should know: I myself have a degree in electrical engineering – but I fled to the warm embrace of software as soon as I graduated. Hardware was much too temperamental for me.
Argentar, fortunately, is made of sterner stuff.
Good thing, too. Over the next year he’s going to need everything he’s got.
2. August 2010: Minions! Go! Argentar acquires two new things:
* a small crew of university undergraduates who have signed on for a work-experience term. They may not be experienced, but they only cost $5K/month.
* A blog. What follows is a selection of its greatest hits over the next roller-coaster year. (No, you can’t go read the whole thing: it’s mostly private. I have some access because I’m a friend of a friend.)
I have a tiny start-up, but I hesitate to call that my job, ’cause it doesn’t pay me anything, and in fact has an impressive burn rate. Since my patent applications will become public soon, I’m slowly lowering the veil of secrecy around my full-time hobby.
He and his minions get to work designing a working prototype of his concentrator. Everything seems to go well for a couple of months, until –
3. Early October 2010: Mo’ Hardware Mo’ Problems. They hit the first of many hardware pitfalls: parts. As Argentar says, “Badly written software often still runs, but badly build hardware usually doesn’t.”
Having now spent a long time on the phone with various prototype outfits, we’ve found that a couple of the ones we wanted to work with are offering very coarse tolerances. Both the rapid CNC-machining place and the one outfit that’ll do “rapid” extrusion (still a six-week lead time (because they have to make a die, then test it, then send us a sample part for approval, then adjust the die because the sample is wrong, then and so on and so forth)) are saying they can manage only ±0.01″/0.2mm on key dimensions. That’s too crude for optics work; ten-fold finer would be better.
and meanwhile
One of the other things we still need is a light source that can simulate full sun. I’m leaning towards LED arrays, and trying to get the overall power in the visible, NIR (meaning wavelengths < 1100nm, the bandgap of silicon solar cells), and far IR bands approximately correct. Problem: finding LEDs with longer wavelengths is difficult, and they’re not very efficient ( → very expensive) … The IEC is willing to let us use their new full-sun test cell… if we’re willing to wait until december, which, um, we’re not. *sigh* So, we still need to come up with some way of simulating sunlight.
I suspect that if I wasn’t captain of this ship, I’d be running for the lifeboats already. (The students can’t run; since they’re graded on this, they’re effectively chained to the benches.)
4. Late October 2010: The Scramble For Solutions.
The current plan for simulating sunlight is to use quartz-tube radiant heater elements combined with red and green LEDs to build up more or less the right spectrum. While the spectrum will be crudely approximated, this approach has the advantages that the heater bits are already long and thin, the LEDs in question are both cheap and efficient, and unlike using high-intensity IR LEDs to build up the IR spectrum, are unlikely to accidentally blind anybody. (Since I know academic labs are really sloppy about safety, I don’t want my team messing around with gear that can do them serious harm on my orders. I can’t help if they electrocute themselves with high-voltage power supplies, but I can avoid adding to the risk.)
Ah, another charming quirk of hardware: the threats of, say, accidental blinding or death by electrocution. Have I mentioned that I really like software?
The other problem is solved by the simple expedient of throwing his scarce money at it:
I’m going to buy a ~$15k mold, which probably won’t be useful after this prototyping stage. I can’t really afford this, but the other alternative would be to essentially abandon the student prototyping effort. I might be able to take the monetary loss on that, but the time is gone for good, and I’d still need to find a bunch of engineers to build a prototype for me. (That’s been previously estimated at $50-100k, and I certainly can’t afford that without investors, grants, or loans… but the point of having a prototype is to demonstrate that the technology is worth investing in.)
Writing off a $15k mold, but having labor at a fixed $5k/semester isn’t so bad… I could be flailing around while paying professional engineers $200+/hr each to help me learn in a particularly inefficient manner.
5. In Which Our Hero Considers The Lessons He Has Learned The Hard Way So Far
Observations: * I was even more unprepared for this than I suspected. Specifically, I should have done much more groundwork talking to vendors about tolerances and lead times. * I’ve learned an expensive lesson about manufacturing tolerances and the difficulties of dealing with them. But I can’t see that there was anything that I could have done to prevent this, since I was too unfamiliar with the problem to grasp its difficulty.
6. November 2010: Plus/Minus
+ ordered optical components for prototype today – critical path has no slack left – discovered that bank silently reduced credit limit on company card, necessitating use of personal card for the Part of Unusual Complexity. – still need to catch up on far too many things from ~9 week push on this project
7. Catastrophe Redux
Oh yes. Another endemic hardware problem: it breaks.
My student engineers and I have run into a little crippling problem with the prototype light concentrator array we’re building: the bare solar cells are too fragile to handle. We’ve broken most of ones we had trying to mount them, even handling them with tweezers. So, I’m looking for ideas on what to try next. I figure somebody who reads this must have some experience working with fragile things. …anybody got other ideas?
8. Into The Melee
And now, on to a milieu perhaps even less forgiving than hardware: business development.
I talked to a new lawyer (at the same law firm) about the contract I want to sign with the current /bus/dev/ folks. It turns out the reason my patent attorney wanted me to talk to him is that he tried to start a company, but was betrayed by one of the hired suits they got to run it, which caused a funding deal to collapse.
So… he had lots of skeptical things to say about /bus/dev/ companies and in fact anybody else who tries to get money out of start-ups. In short: caveat emptor, and keep your laser legal team handy. and now I’ve got a long list of questions to ask the /bus/dev/ guys about the contract and a another measure of circumspection to add to my deep suspicion of the /bus/dev/industry.
iIm also clear that the fundamental relationship I’m entering w/ the /bus/dev/ guys is prospector to over-priced-equipment vendor during a gold rush. While lots of people talk about “long term relationships”, it’s fundamentally true that the /bus/dev/ guys are paid in cash, and if my company flames out, it will at worst just disappoint them.
9. December 2010: Victory Snatched From The Jaws Of Defeat?
It appears the solution to the strengthening and handling question is double-sided tape. It’s cheap, it’s off-the-shelf with no lead time, and it’s relatively strong… The cells we have wired up are working very close to perfectly, which is a big relief.
As expected, our construction schedule has gone *poof*! one vendor — who shall remain nameless so long as they don’t further annoy me — finally shipped parts, only two and a half weeks late. But we now have the parts and test equipment in hand. That sounds lame, but it’s a surprisingly big step: it means everything could be manufactured with very short timelines, and was.
Most importantly, the quality of the optical components is far beyond what I was expecting … this means that an extremely cheap process can produce a difficult part for pennies a square meter. My fantasies involving lopping two-thirds off the price of solar power seem much less fantastic now.
I’ve just signed the contract hiring a business development firm. Because of the way it’s set up, I’m up on the hook for at least $16k over the next two months. Even though I’m fully aware of the cost of doing business as a high-tech start-up, that’s still bracing.
10. Victory!
Q: what is the fully amortized cost of a watt of electricity generated from coal?
A: $2.22
Q: what is the fully amortized cost of a watt of electricity generated by a short production run of my panels?
A: $2.17, according to my student engineers. I have not verified this number, nor do I know what assumptions went into it. I know they haven’t thought too hard about it, because they got the production cost estimates just this morning, so I suspect there may be some error.
However, this is for the existing design, which is just a step up from bear skins and stone knives… and a longer production run gets the cost down to around $1.50/W, according to the students. This is strongly suggestive that with a better design, some cost engineering, and a production run of hundreds of thousands of panels, I’ll be able to reach the mythical $1/W cost, and dominate the world power industry (insert maniacal laughter here).
11. …maybe.
Revised A: $2.58
That’s a very rough cost of manufacturing one of my panels to produce a watt of power at peak rating. It’s not as useful a number as I’d hoped, but still isn’t bad either. It’s deliberately a high estimate, since where we had to fudge extrapolate numbers, we aimed high, so that all the error is against us. For example, we used the retail cost we paid for a single box of 12 solar cells to estimate the cost of silicon in the system. Just accounting for regular wholesale markup should roughly halve that, and bulk orders from solar cell foundries might reduce it to a tenth that.
Since plastic and metal costs were roughly equal to the cost of silicon in our spreadsheet, that knocks the guesstimated peak watt cost to a buck and change, easily enough to undercut the grid. Go us! I’ll eventually have to get a total cost of ownership, but looking at other vendors’ claims suggests that will put me ahead of the game — nobody wants to own up to that.
12. January 2011: The Patent Game
An international patent examiner has looked over the prior art and found a patent he claims makes my work obvious. Which would be a crippling problem except for the similarities ending with the words “light concentrator for solar energy use”. As it is, it’s just a nuisance: I know about this patent, my attorney knows about this patent, and we know how to overcome such claims.
I don’t want to say the differences should be obvious on inspection, but they’re very easy to state, largely involving mechanical complexity and cost of the prior art. Oh, and just some utterly trivial differences in the way it functions. I mean, a diesel engine is just like a steam engine, right? Y’know: pistons, heat, intake, exhaust, motion, blah, blah, blah.
Legally, inventors are expected to know the entire prior art in the field they’re inventing in. Inventors are also expected to cite all relevant prior art in the patent application, although the law punishes only deliberate omission. The main practical effect of having cited it is that we also listed a few reasons it doesn’t apply, so later, binding examinations can see that we were already aware of the prior art, and give our objections more credence.
Apparently, I got off easy. It’s unusual that this round of patent examining finds only a single pre-empting patent. This is a very good sign that my patent application will succeed, and gives me hope that it will issue quickly.
13. The Business Game
The business plan has been declared done. What we ended up with sure looks like a best-seller: even allowing for huge mark-ups and large, unanticipated costs, we think that my solar arrays can undercut the power grid with another year’s worth of engineering, and a year after that the company will turn a profit of a half million dollars. Growth thereafter is limited only by our ability to raise capital to keep up with demand.
Now, everybody who deals with business knows this is genre fiction, but one of the little white lies of the business world is that we treat it as fact.
14. February 2011: Running To Stand Still
My to-do list grows without bound, which is a fancy way of saying I’m overwhelmed. There are simply more things to do than I have time for (at least while preserving what’s left of my sanity). Bringing investment in will help some, but too many of the things seem to require me. While gathering data tomorrow, I’m not — for example — working on my pitch for the upcoming poster session. While the /bus/dev/ guys can do a lot of that stuff for me, I have to polish the result for my speaking style. And I need to chase after a particular business contact who the /bus/dev/ guys don’t know yet. And so on.
15. March 2011: The Rubber Chicken Circuit
15a:
I talked to a local angel/VC fund. Only three guys from the fund there: the head, his lieutenant, and their minion. They seemed very interested, and asked lots of questions. The head even called up another VC that only does energy plays, and gave them my pitch(!). Other VC interested: asked detailed technical questions, wants to see business plan.
Result: their lips said no, but the way the /bus/dev/ guy interprets their answer is that they want the energy VC (or possibly somebody else) to take the lead, and they’ll follow, because they lack the technical background to really evaluate my technology. The /bus/dev/ guy thinks that if the energy VC is interested, the two funds will will come up with all the money I need to get stuff on the market, ~$850k, probably split $600k/$250k. /bus/dev/ thinks this is the sort of deal they want because they asked for our nominal valuation ($3.25 million, by the pneumatic valuation method, ie we pulled a number out of the air), and didn’t balk when we said that the $850k would get them about a quarter of the company. (We don’t think they’ll take that offer, but merely accept that it’s our opening position.)
15b:
This group was a large investor consortium; there were 33 people at the table, and some unknown number watching via video conference at remote sites. They were interested, but asked a bunch of questions I didn’t have answers to, mostly about money. Fast, definitive turn-around, though: they voted while-I-waited. Answer: no. The claimed reason is that they look at later stage companies. We suspect they’re concerned about technical risk.
15c:
An investment fund said no. I knew this pitch wasn’t gonna go well as soon as they said their investors are union pension funds. While they’re looking for risk to drive up returns, they’re not looking for that much risk. The feedback we got was worth the nickel, though. They like the technology, but want to see some operating experience. That’s the same as we’d gotten from the previous bunch who were unimpressed.
16. May 2011: Seeded!
I now have
1) a logo 2) investors 3) a salary
which means this quixotic quest goes from being an expensive hobby to being a job. My salary is charmingly low, but its real point is just to make it possible for me to continue to play tech entrepreneur until Serious Money shows up, which ought to happen after the next prototype has sat on peoples’ roofs for a few months.
17. July 2011: Preparing For Liftoff
Need to round up engineers soon. Way behind on that as a consequence of being way behind on working up my data. To paraphrase an ancient videogame, “startup geek needs staff, badly.”
Today, Sun Edge has $200,000 in seed funding, and a new batch of students is working on the concentrator’s frame and cooling system, while professionals are being brought in to build the next, fully functional prototype, with a target date of early 2012. Argentar has already sunk a year of his life and $100,000 of his own money into the project … but even though the science still seems very promising, there’s no guarantee of market success. An entrepeneur’s life is never easy. When he or she is building hardware, it’s even harder.

650,"Apple Patent Describes Solar-Powered iPhone, Notebook Charger",https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/26/apple-patent-describes-solar-power-iphone-notebook-charger/,2011/08/26,"
Among the 16 new patents granted to Apple this week by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, was this fairly interesting one describing a solar-powered charging system for electronic devices. The patent details a system that includes a voltage converter and controller that would work alongside a solar power source.
The voltage converter would be attached to a solar power source by way of an input cable. It would also be attached to an “electronic load” via an output cable. That “electronic load” could be a “portable electronic device,” says the filing – which basically means almost anything Apple makes, from iPhones to MacBooks.
The voltage converter is configured to monitor an amount of power drawn by the device at its output, while the controller is configured to control the voltage converter in order to reduce the amount of power drawn subsequently, if it goes over a certain predetermined threshold. In other words, it’s a key part to a solar power charging system for electronics.
Apple has previously filed patents for an auxiliary solar cell, that would work as a backup power source for mobile devices, as well as a method for covering a device in solar cells. However, it’s not likely that we’ll see solar-powered gadgets from Apple (or anyone, for that matter), until the costs associated with their production are reduced.

651,GM and LG Team Up on Electric Vehicles,https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/26/gm-and-lg-team-up-on-electric-vehicles/,2011/08/26,"
Auto maker General Motors and LG Group will be working together to design and engineer electric vehicles thanks to a new partnership that expands on LG’s earlier work for GM in lithium-ion batteries.  Previously, LG delivered batteries for the Chevrolet Volt, the Opel Ampera, and later for a demo fleet of Chevrolet Cruze electric vehicles.
According to the companies, their goal is to reduce both the cost and the time it takes to build electric cars.
LG will cover half the cost for the new EVs and will work alongside engineers from GM to collaborate on components, vehicle structures and architectures. LG will also become GM’s supplier for the components, which it’s permitted to sell to other auto makers. That means this partnership will be good for the electric vehicle industry as a whole, and not just GM.
The deal comes at a time when U.S. automakers are under pressure to raise the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards, per a recent agreement. By the end of 2025, they must meet a CAFE of 54.5 mpg (23.2 km/l) – a goal that will involve improvements to internal combustion and diesel engines, for the most part. But GM says that electric vehicles are expected to play “a major role” in reaching the CAFE goal, too.
There was no timeframe given for the vehicles’ launch.

652,FlyKly Electric Bikes Are Coming To San Francisco,https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/23/flykly-electric-bikes-are-coming-to-san-francisco/,2011/08/23,"
Electric bike maker FlyKly is bringing its stylish, powerful and eco-friendly bikes to San Francisco after having a blowout launch in New York earlier this summer. The company, which opened up shop on June 20th, sold out its entire stock of bikes in July at a pop-up store in Soho. Now, the bikes are being made available in San Francisco.
Calling these things “bicycles” seems odd, though – a term that conjures up streamers from from the handlebars and a wicker basket tied to the front. Instead, these “bicycles” look more like scooters. But since the bikes don’t go over 20 MPH, you don’t need a license to drive them.

The new bikes come in two designs: vintage and modern, each which sport a 100% electric lithium-ion battery. For just a $1’s worth of electricity, you’ll get 1,000 miles of riding, says FlyKly, at 40 miles per charge. (The battery reaches a full charge in just a few hours.) The battery is also removable, so you can charge it anywhere you want. And if the battery ever runs out, you can pedal manually to keep going.

Like ordinary bikes, FlyKly bikes can be parked and tied up to fenceposts, bike racks, sidewalks and parking garages offering spaces for bikes. The steering column and rear wheel are locked when parked. And just in case, the bikes also include a GPS tracking system for locating your bike if it ever starts moving when you’re not on it.
Oh, and in case you were wondering, “Kly” is a Greek word that means “constant energy or movement.”
FlyKly sells the bikes for $1,900 and shipping is free in the U.S. You can learn more about the bikes on the company’s website here: www.flykly.com.

653,13-Year-Old Designs Efficient Solar Array Inspired By Oak Trees,https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/21/13-year-old-designs-efficient-solar-array-inspired-by-oak-trees/,2011/08/21,"
When it comes to renewable energy solutions, sometimes nature has the best ideas. That was 13-year-old Aidan Dwyer’s conclusion after a wintry hike in New York’s Catskill Mountains, a trip that inspired him to build a unique and effective solar array design. 
Dwyer observed patterns in the trees and, after further research and contemplation, realized the branches matched up with the Fibonacci sequence, a mathematical pattern found throughout nature, such as in falcon flight paths, nautilus shells and ratios within the human body.

Dwyer speculated that this pattern aided the trees in photosynthesis and tested his hypothesis by building a miniature tree-shaped solar array. The project won him a 2011 Young Naturalist Award from the American Museum of Natural History.

The 7th grader describes his experiments in a detailed essay:
I designed and built my own test model, copying the Fibonacci pattern of an oak tree. I studied my results with the compass tool and figured out the branch angles. The pattern was about 137 degrees and the Fibonacci sequence was 2/5. Then I built a model using this pattern from PVC tubing. In place of leaves, I used PV solar panels hooked up in series that produced up to 1/2 volt, so the peak output of the model was 5 volts. The entire design copied the pattern of an oak tree as closely as possible.
The design generated up to 50% more power than the model of a traditional solar installation during periods of low sunlight. The individual solar panels’ various angles help the array capture light even when the sun is very low in the sky. And, since they don’t lie flat, many of the panels are also less affected by shade and snow. 
At this point, Dwyer’s design a backyard experiment, but perhaps in the future we’ll see roof gardens planted with solar tree arrays.

654,Google Taking Street View To The Depths Of The Amazon,https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/19/google-taking-street-view-to-the-depths-of-the-amazon/,2011/08/19,"
It’s hard to believe that Google’s Street View has been in use for over four years. What’s more amazing, perhaps, given the rate at which they have canvassed the world’s streets and alleyways, that there is anywhere left unmapped. But while their teams have successfully traced the surfaces of most large cities and a number of other interesting areas, I suppose it won’t come as a surprise that the remote reaches of the Amazon have not yet been put under the lens.
They aim to change that, however, and have detailed in a blog post their plans to Street-View-ize a large section of the river. It’s being done in collaboration with the Foundation for a Sustainable Amazon, a nonprofit working in the area.
To map the entire length of the Amazon, its tributaries, and distributaries, is the work of years, however, so Google won’t be attempting that just yet (though there are plenty of spots to drop the orange guy if you’re curious). For now, they’re focusing their efforts on a 50km stretch of the Rio Negro starting around Manaus, right about at the center of this image:

They’ll also be going down the dirt paths to small villages with the Street View Trike, mapping all the while, and will set up the tripod they use to show business interiors to give a panoramic taste of village life. And as a little parting shot of charity, they’ll be leaving behind some equipment, probably some cameras and laptops, for FAS and the locals to use. The whole thing is sort of a publicity play for sustainability, not that there’s anything wrong with that.
No word on when the project will be complete — from what I’ve read (travelogues from the 1800s, but still), these kinds of trips generally take longer than expected — but you can see some more pictures of their work over at the Google blog post.

655,"GM Announces The Next Volt, The Cadillac ELR",https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/17/cadillac-elr-volt/,2011/08/17,"
GM makes money from platforms, not just cars. With that thought, Cadillac just announced the ELR Coupe, a sleek sportster built on the Voltec platform that also powers the Volt. The dual-powertrain Caddy has been rumored ever since a concept (pictured here) was shown off at the 2009 North American International Auto Show. Well, friends, it’s on.
The ELR will use the same version of the Voltec that powers the Volt including the same four-cylinder 1.4L generator. This makes the ELR sound nothing more than a reskinned Volt instead of the tuned electric roadster worth of that sexy sheet metal. Nothing says American sports coupe like a 0-to-60 time in eight and half seconds. 
Cadillac has yet to announce any real details about the upcoming coupe. “Development of the ELR is just underway, so details on performance, price and timing will be announced later,” says the press release. 

The extended coupe design actually makes a lot of sense for the Volt’s 2+2 configuration. The rear seats are not all that usable anyway. This modified design likely allows it to slip through the air with even less resistance. The photos shown here are of the 2009 Converj concept. The brand is pretty loyal to its sharp lines and massive grill design so the production version will probably follow the same styling cues if not be exactly the same thing.
The Chevy Volt hasn’t exactly been a huge hit for GM. The auto maker reportedly sold just 125 last month and less than 3,000 so far this year. The model will soon be available nationwide, which might help move a few more off dealer lots. This Cadillac model will be the second production car, outside of the Volt’s European and Australian cousins, to utilize the series and hybrid powertrain. Since it wears the crest and wreath logo, it might even have a well-appointed cabin rather than the plastic toy that is the Chevy Volt.

656,Ford to Sell Solar Panel System Alongside Electric Cars,https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/17/ford-to-sell-solar-panel-system-alongside-electric-cars/,2011/08/17,"
Ford Motor Company is teaming up with San Jose-based solar panel maker SunPower to offer a rooftop solar system option which will be sold alongside the upcoming Ford Focus EV. The “Drive Green for Life” program, as it’s being called, involves mounting solar panels on a customer’s home.
These panels wouldn’t be used just to charge the Focus itself, however. They actually help offset the cost that comes with having to charge the car, something which most electric car owners do every night.
The 2.5 kilowatt solar panel system would offset the cost of about 1,000 miles per month, says Ford. After federal tax credits, the cost of the system would be around $10,000. Some local and state rebates may also be available, but it’s still a fairly pricey system.
At least Ford and SunPower are targeting the appropriate demographic. The option should appeal to environmentalists who want to buy an electric car, but don’t want to  feel guilty about consuming all the extra electricity needed to charge it. After all, it’s not really that “green” to drive electric when you’re charging your car using fossil fuels.
The solar system itself consists of 147 square feet of rooftop panels. There are 11 panels, measuring 4 feet by 2 feet. Customers will be able to monitor the panels’ performance online and via a specially designed iPhone app. SunPower also provides a 25-year warranty for the system, which is installed at customers’ homes by Best Buy’s Geek Squad. Best Buy also has the contract with Ford to install the home chargers.
Pricing and an exact launch date for the new 2012 Ford Focus isn’t available yet, but the car will go on sale first in California and New York in Q4 2011. Ford also plans to launch 5 other electric or hybrid-electric models in 2012 in North America, and in Europe by 2013.

Google has taken to its public blog this morning to talk about the company’s focus on building greener, more sustainable workplaces for its employees. The company is involved in several green initiatives, including energy and water audits, the use of green building materials, and competitive programs that pit teams against each other to become the greener office.
In addition, Google says that it has now added its first LEED-certified building to the Googleplex in Mountain View, California.
LEED, which stands for “Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design,” is an internationally recognized certification program for rating green buildings. Google says this is not its first LEED building, but it is the first at the Googleplex.
The new LEED platinum achievement was awarded for an interior renovation which used healthy building materials and practices, says Google. The company now has 4.5 million square feet of building space worldwide which it hopes will soon earn the LEED certification.
Other green building practices used by Google include:

Avoiding materials that contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other known toxins that may harm human health by using materials free from the Living Building Challenge Red List Materials and the EPA Chemicals of Concern

Pushing the construction industry to adopt more transparent practices when it comes to labeling building materials and ask suppliers to meet transparency requirements via the Pharos Project

Invests in the most efficient heating, cooling and lighting systems
Performs regular energy and water audits
Implements conservation measures and develop best practices
Uses renewable energy when possible (like these solar panels)

Google also runs an internal Sustainable Pursuit program that pits teams against each other to earn points based on their office’s green performance, by measuring its green cleaning programs, water use and waste management strategy.

658,Renewable Energy Consumption Tops Nuclear for First Time,https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/16/renewable-energy-consumption-tops-nuclear-for-first-time/,2011/08/16,"
According to a new report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the consumption of energy from renewable sources recently topped both the current and the historical consumption levels for nuclear energy. The shift was immediately caused by nuclear outages that coincided with the high-water season for hydropower generation.
But there’s a long-term upward trend in renewables which can be seen here, too, thanks to the increased consumption of biofuels and wind capacity additions.
In the short-term, the switch from nuclear to renewables was influenced by U.S. weather trends. The Western U.S. saw record-breaking snowfall this year, which led to hydroelectric plants running at maximum capacity and for longer than usual. This occurred while many nuclear facilities were shut down for regular maintenance and refueling, as is typical for this time of year. (Nuclear plants shut down twice per year, once in the spring, once in the winter).

However, the charts provided by the EIA show a long-term shift towards renewables is underway as well, indicating that this was not a fluke occurrence caused by coincidental timing of weather and plant shutdowns.
To compare the various sources, the energy consumed is measured in BTUs (British thermal units). In January, renewable energy consumption was at 724 trillion BTUs, while nuclear consumption was at 761 trillion BTUs. By March, renewables had reached 795 trillion BTUs compared with 687 trillion BTUs for nuclear. And by April, it was 798 trillion BTUs for renewables vs. 571 trillion BTUs for nuclear.
Renewable energy doesn’t just mean sun, wind, water and geothermal sources, the EIA reminds us. It also includes biofuels, like ethanol and biodisel, and biomass, like wood and wood wastes.
This shift in energy consumption doesn’t mean that renewables are now our main source of electricity, however. Outside of electricity generation, the generated energy is also used for transportation, heating and industrial steam production.
Below, you can see that renewable energy is still slightly below that of nuclear for now. But assuming these trends continue, renewables should pass nuclear here, too, sometime in the next few years.

Aviation enthusiasts interested in greener flying might put an Elektra One plane on their wish lists. PC-Aero‘s electric aircraft can fly for up to three hours on one charge with a 100mph cruising speed. The charging happens inside a solar-powered hangar included in the plane’s anticipated purchase price of $145,000.
The plane successfully completed its inaugural flight last spring, and will go on sale mid next year, pending certification as a new ultralight class aircraft in Germany. It recently won the Lindbergh Electric Aircraft Prize for aviation innovation. 

Designed to maximize efficiency, the craft is made of a light fiber composite. With the battery, the plane weights about 440 pounds, and the whole thing is powered by a 13.4 kilowatt (17.96 horsepower) engine. 
Don’t expect to invite friends on board, however: The aircraft only seats one person and the maximum cargo weight – pilot included – is 220 pounds. 

Elektra One cuts down not only on air pollution, but noise pollution as well: Its engineers say the the plane produces one fifth the noise emitted by regular aircraft, and one half the noise produced by regular ultralight planes.

General Electric Co. (GE) bought a minority stake in the California-based solar company eSolar this week. As a result of the deal, Paul Browning, President and CEO of Thermal Products for GE Energy, will join eSolar’s Board of Directors.
ESolar already had a licensing agreement with GE Energy, which granted it exclusive worldwide rights to eSolar’s modular technology for its Integrated Solar Combined Cycle (ISCC) power plant solution. This solution, when combined with GE’s own “FlexEfficiency” 50 Combined Cycle Power Plant technology, is able to deliver fuel efficiencies over 70%.

In less technical terms, this means that GE believes the combination of technologies – natural gas and solar – is the best solution for renewable energy. This combination will ultimately prove to be the most efficient, most flexible and most affordable solution, for addressing the global issue of climate change, the company stated in its release, (using more complicated phrasing, of course).
Hybrid Solar Power Plants
During the day, these “hybrid” plants work by using the sun’s heat to generate steam for the water-steam system which generates the electricity. This is done through the use of small, flat, pre-fabricated mirrors which reflect heat back to a tower-mounted receiver. Natural gas is not used during daylight hours. But at night, or during periods of cloud cover, the plant will then use natural gas.
GE’s rights to the ISCC technology currently exclude China and India, but the companies say they are now targeting Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the U.S.
ESolar was created in 2007 by Idealab founder Bill Gross, with the goal of using pre-fabricated form factors in combination with advanced software systems to deliver cost-competitive solar energy.

Earlier today, I had an amazing realisation: I spend at least half my day breathing in. The other half I spend breathing out. Combined, I spend literally my entire life breathing. 
Enough.
From today I am quitting breathing. No more will my lungs be constantly tied up with the intake of oxygen and the removal of carbon dioxide. In one bold step I will be free from the oppressive yoke of gaseous exchange.
Now, I know what you’re thinking: if I quit breathing cold turkey, won’t my blood quickly fill up with unwanted carbon dioxide? Perhaps. I’m sure at some points over the coming weeks I’ll need to take the occasional inward or outward breaths, to deal with emergency situations or to avoid asphyxia. But, generally speaking, I’m done.
I have a feeling, for the next two minutes at least, my productivity is going to go through the roof. After that, who can say? I’ll post the results here on TechCrunch.

Tesla has released their shareholder statement for Q2 2011, and while it doesn’t make for the most exciting reading, it’s at least full of fairly good news. They’ve been on cruise control for quite a while now, if you will, designing and testing their Model S sedan, but there are plenty of pitfalls that could have afflicted the process, techniques and technologies that could have failed to pan out, and cost overruns that could have piled up. But no, things are going as expected and barring any major upsets, they should have the Model S rolling out in mid-2012 as planned.
Here are a few Q2 takeaways from the letter:

Total revenue for Q2: $58m ($27m in Roadster revenue, $19m from Toyota for RAV4 EV development, $11m from powertrain sales)
Projected 2011 revenue: $180-190m (up slightly from previous estimates)
Operating expenses for Q2: $77m
Projected 2011 operating expenses: $220-245m (up from <$200m in previous estimates)
Cash on hand: $331m
Remaining in Dept of Energy loan: $331m
Final Roadsters should be built by January (total of 2500 vehicles)
RAV4 EV development should be finished in early 2012, vehicle shipping that year (more from Toyota soon)
Model S should be shipping in “mid-2012,” Model X crossover in late 2013 at the earliest
Over 5600 Model S reservations with accelerating growth
Model S currently in “beta” form with prototype tooling and processes, should enter “release candidate” form in Q1 2012
150 hires this quarter, total team ~1400 now

And that’s that. The full letter, with cost and sales breakdowns, can be read here (PDF), and more information, including a link to the investors’ conference call and Q&A, can be found at their investor relations page.
Basically we’re not going to hear much news until the production Model S starts hitting car mags (we’ll try to get one too), the Model X gets leaked or previewed, and the RAV4 gets priced and dated — all of which will be happening in 2012, most likely. That means a few more quiet quarters. With so many pre-orders for the Model S, they’re sure to have plenty of revenue as soon as they start charging their customers — with a few hundred million dollars locked down for the next few years, they’re feeling confident and I’m guessing their investors are as well.
Update: Elon Musk mentioned in the conference call that they plan to unveil the Model X prototype in mid-December.

663,"Nissan Leaf Companion App Is Now Available For Android, BlackBerry",https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/03/nissan-leaf-android-blackberry/,2011/08/03,"
Nissan Leaf owners, take note. The Leaf companion app is now available in both Android and BlackBerry flavors. These smartphone apps follow the steps of the iOS version that launched alongside the Leaf earlier this year. All the key features are here: battery level meter, charging schedule, estimated range, and climate control functions. 
The apps themselves are free to download, owning a Leaf is not required. But they understandably need a Leaf to properly function. Still, perspective buyers or curious onlookers can download and explore the apps for free.
I looked at the Leaf iOS app during my time with the Leaf. It’s a fine app, granting owners access to the key functions of the Leaf from afar. The only notable missing function is the ability to toggle the car’s locks.

We’ve seen a number of startups emerge that are using a sampling box as a way to help consumers discover products, including Babbaco, Foodzie, BirchBox and BeachMint. Blissmo is the latest company to join the mix with the launch of the Blissmobox, which allows consumers to discover organic and eco-friendly products that safer and better for them, their families and their planet.
The Blissmobox is a subscription service that delivers these eco-friendly products to your door once a month. Each box has a theme for the month, and each month Blissmo offers two different boxes. 
For example, a few months ago, Blissmo’s inaugural box had a “Home & Laundry” theme, included method laundry prdoducts, iQ All-Purpose Cleaner, Twist sponges and more. In June, Blissmo features a Food & Beverage box with CLIF bar, Kaia Foods, quinoa, and a Skin and Beauty box with YesToCarrots, Out of Africa, and others. 
Upcoming boxes include a bath & shower box, a”morning” box (toothpaste, floss, etc.) and more.  Each box also includes an insert with descriptions of each product. Founder Sundeep Ahuja says that products are selected with strong credentials around organic, eco-friendly, sustainable or otherwise “better” than conventional alternatives.
Ahuja says people often buy what they buy because it’s what they’ve been buying eventhough they may prefer products without toxins that are safer for them, their families and their planet. Blissmobox exposes to subscribers to new products, encourages them to try these items, and perhaps helps build a new brand loyalty to these products. 
Currently, Blissmobox subscriptions are $19 per month plus a $3 flat rate shipping rate for the U.S. If a customer buys three months up front they get free shipping. Ahuja says that 20% of subscribers are already opting to buy 3 months up front to save $9 on shipping.

665,HaloIPT Revs Up For Wirelessly Charged Electric Cars,https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/01/haloipt-revs-up-for-wirelessly-charged-electric-cars/,2011/08/01,"
Those who resist purchasing an electric car because charging stations are less ubiquitous than gas stations or figuring out how to charge your car at home seems complicated have one less excuse to go green. A new system from British startup HaloIPT allows cars to be charge wirelessly using induction.
The wirelessly transmitted power goes to the car’s battery for an ongoing charge, similar to the concept of recharging an electric toothbrush but with a lot more energy. Each car is outfitted with a pad underneath the car that is ready to receive power.
The technology could also work for moving vehicles.  The company is partnering with Drayson Racing Technologies to test drive the technology, which harnesses inductive power transfer via transmitters placed beneath the race track.  The cars don’t have to be directly over the transmitters to receive electricity, nor do they have to be parked to receive, so HaloIPT says the system will work even as racers swerve around their competitors. 
It’ll be a while before the race car sees the starting line: HaloIPT and Drayson plan to be ready for showtime by the end of 2015. But HaloIPT hopes to use what it learns with Drayson to apply their technology to non race car drivers’ needs. 
In the meantime, wireless charging fans can ogle over the stationary model of the system featured in Rolls-Royce’s experimental 102EX Phantom. 
The company outlines its vision in this video:

667,Buying An Electric Car,https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/31/buying-an-electric-car/,2011/07/31,"
This guest post is by venture capitalist David Cowan. David has recently purchased a Nissan Leaf after going car-less for two year.
After 3.5 years, I’ve finally re-joined the community of car owners.
Between February 2008 and last week, I was car-less. I borrowed and rented cars, took taxis and Zip cars, and occasionally biked. I also bummed a lot of rides (thank you very much – you know who you are).  It had started when the warranty on my fancy German gas guzzler expired; I sold the thing, and never really found the time to shop around for a replacement – Who Has Time For This?
I felt a lot more excited about the prospect of driving an electric sedan, which should be greener, potentially faster, simpler to operate, and cheaper to fuel.  Most importantly, I’d never have to kill ten minutes stopping for gas – Who Has Time For This? So I put my name down on the lists for a Tesla Model S, Fisker Karma, Nissan Leaf and Chevy Volt, deciding to wait for one to be built.  Three years later, I got calls from Fisker, Nissan and Chevy, and it was time to decide.
After examining the options and driving the cars, it was a pretty easy decision to buy the Leaf for these eight reasons:
1. Compared to the others, the Leaf gets twice the range from a battery charge: 100 miles, or 85 miles with the AC cranking. (Plugging the car in and out adds about 15 seconds a day to your daily routine, or 5 minutes a month – about half the time we spend at gas pumps.)
2. With a pure electric motor (not a hybrid gasoline engine) the Leaf is nimbler, less fragile, and legal to drive in California’s carpool lanes so I can bypass the Highway 101 traffic jams – WHTFT?
3. Driving in electric mode (without the help of a hybrid gasoline engine) is wonderfully quiet and smooth (no transmission). Even at 80 miles per hour the acceleration is immediate and impressive.
4. The Leaf steers as smoothly as a Lexus, and the small wheels turn on a dime.
5. Only the Leaf has open, comfortable seats with ample head room in front and leg room in back (a must if you have kids)
6. Only the Leaf carries 5 passengers (a must if you have THREE kids!)
7. The Leaf has the largest trunk, and the back seats fold down for more cargo space.
8. The Leaf costs 3/4 as much as the Volt, and 1/3 as much as the Karma. You get at least $7500 in tax credits, offset by the $2,000 expense of a home 220 volt charging station.

These reasons explain why the Nissan Leaf now the outsells the pack. I can think of only three good reasons why you might wish to buy one of the other cars:
1. The Leaf’s pure electric motor is not a problem for two car families – on that rare day once a month when you drive more than 100 miles, you can always take the gas guzzler instead (Honda Odysseys are awesome). But without that fallback, one-car households will find the Volt more practical (albeit expensive and cramped).

2. If you love driving enormous, heavy sports cars that sit low to the ground and you’ve got $100k to burn (like these guys), then you might prefer the gorgeous design of the Karma. It has the look and feel of a luxury muscle car with a growling engine, bucket seats, and beautiful wood/leather interiors. (The Leaf is all plastic.) Having said that, the Karma performs like a sports car at lower speeds but on the highway I found it downright sluggish compared to the Leaf. The Karma handled highway acceleration nearly as well as the Leaf only when in Stealth Mode which means that the gasoline engine is off. (You may be as disappointed as I was to learn that people can still see you in Stealth Mode.)
3. Stephen Colbert will mock you for driving a Leaf.
All three cars come chock full of gizmos we all love (rear view camera, navigation, keyless entry, XM radio, Bluetooth, heated seats…) so there’s no reason to stick with gasoline. The Leaf even comes with a cool iPhone app for remote operation of the charger and climate control.
So I’ve been zipping around in my Leaf for a week now and absolutely loving it.  Even after three years, it was worth the wait.

668,Japanese Professor Shows Rare Earth-Free Electric Car (Video),https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/26/japanese-professor-shows-rare-earth-free-electric-car-video/,2011/07/26,"
Prices for rare earth elements have gone through the roof in recent years, with China basically monopolizing the market for these rare substances (the country currently produces a whopping 97 percent of all rare earths used globally). But in the field of electric vehicles, the dependence on rare earths could be a thing of the past soon: Professor Nobukazu Hoshi’s Lab from the Tokyo University of Science has developed an electric car that doesn’t require any kind of rare earths.
The current prototype (a re-modeled Mazda Roadster from 1999) is powered by a 400V/9.5kWh hybrid car motor. The lithium-battery consists of five modules that are sized at 215x335x210mm and weigh 20kg each. Professor Hoshi developed a so-called switched reluctance motor that boasts an output of 50kW – no rare earth elements required.
In the video embedded below (shot by Diginfonews in Tokyo), the professor explains the technology behind the motor and points out there is room for improvement (specifically, he wants to boost torque and energy efficiency and push down noise and vibration).
Still, a pretty impressive accomplishment for a university lab (Toyota is working on a rare earths-free engine for electric cars, too).
Here’s the video (in English):

Realtime car traffic data company Inrix has raised $37 million in series D funding led by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers’ Green Growth Fund and August Capital. This brings Inrix’s funding to nearly $70 million. Post-funding, Inrix’s valuation is just shy of $500 million. 
Inrix aggregates and crowdsources real-time traffic information from more than 10 million spurces including cars, taxis, delivery vehicles, trucks and other channels,  Inrix’s data software aggregates and enhances traffic-related information from hundreds of public and private sources and then sells this data to mobile app developers and websites. 
Currently the company offers data for 22 countries across North America and Europe and reaches more than 100 million users. Inrix’s partners include Audi AG, ADAC, ALK, ANWB, Coyote, the Ford Motor Company, I-95 Coalition, MapQuest, Microsoft, NAVIGON, Tele Atlas, Telmap, TeleNav, Texas Transportation Institute and Toyota. 
For example, Audi and Toyota are using Inrix traffic services in their vehicles starting with the new Audi A6 in Europe and Toyota Entune-equipped Prius V and Camry in North America. Inrix currently powers Ford SYNC traffic and navigation services. 
Inrix also offers traffic apps for the iPhone and Android platforms, which have seen 1.5 million downloads. The company also white labels traffic apps for Ford, Navigon, and Pioneer. And Inrix partners with U.S. and European regional transportation agencies to help manage their road networks and provide travel information to the public, and more. 
With all these partnerships and licensing agreements, Inrix, which is profitable, is growing revenue by nearly a 100 percent year over year. The company’s CEO Bryan Mistele tell us that his goal is to “be the Google of traffic info.” 
Mistele says that the company didn’t necessarily need to raise money but decided that a cash influx would help scale Inrix to the next level. The new investment will be used to fuel acquisition efforts, continued global expansion and research and development.

670,Lego Cased Computer Crunches Efficiently For A Good Cause,https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/23/lego-computer-crunches-efficiently/,2011/07/23,"
For many people, building with Legos brings back fond memories. For Mike Schropp, the memories are still being built. Schropp loves Legos, often incorporating them into technology. For his latest project, Schropp built a 12-core PC tucked into a custom made case he designed using some 2,000 black Lego bricks. The finished product is not only awesome looking, but also energy efficient.
Schropp was interested in building a machine that could contribute some of its computing power to a community grid, helping crunch data to solve medical challenges. He originally intended to build a machine from scratch, but thought adding a fourth computer to his home seemed excessive. 
Instead, Schropp challenged himself to optimize and speed up his existing setup by combining the best of his machines into one super box. He hoped to spend no more than $2,000 on parts, and to build a machine that could process 100,000 “points” per day towards the World Community Grid. Since the machine was intended to crunch around the clock, energy efficiency was of particular significance in the design process. 

With help from his collection of Lego bricks, Schropp turned three computers into one. The finished product contains a trio of CPUs, coolers, motherboards, SSDs, DDR3 memory and eight fans. The unit runs on only one power supply, which Schropp modified to power all three systems. Schropp designed the Lego case to allow for as much airflow as possible between the CPUs and motherboards. 
Through the new, giant box, Schropp’s ‘folding farm’ contributes to humanitarian and medical research using less power than the sum of three boxes running independently. 

The three-in-one box consumes approximately 670 watts of power to crunch about 135,000 points per day, as compared to just one of Schropp’s old workstations PCs, which used 350 watts to crunch close to 10,000 points per day. Even so, the power supply is greater than what the system needs, in anticipation of adding another level in the future.

While I’m sure these are 100% safe, it’s a little odd to see this wee one sitting in a Belkinz cardboard high chair that folds flat and is completely disposable if/when junior goes lateral on the mashed potatoes.
The kit, made by an Australian firm, is available for purchase but it might be a little hard to find around these parts. It is good for kids who are up to 20 months of age and seems like a perfect solution toting to restaurants, grandma’s house, and other places you might not want to drag your entire high chair.
The Feedaway is “safe, strong and stores away in a tiny space” and it is also presumably, in some way, water and fireproof. It takes about three minutes to assemble (once you’ve assembled a few of them). It is cut out of one sheet of cardboard “to minimize waste.” It’s been around for quite a while, actually, but only is just rolling out in retail quantities, which is kind of exciting in a boring, parents-of-a-young-child kind of way.

Centuries from now, archeologists will come upon a cache of these Sprout biodegradable watches and find only their movements, the thin wafers of silicon corroded into each other like the Antikythera mechanism and surrounded by Big Gulp cups and Pringles cans, a testament to a brand’s dedication to eco-friendliness.
See, the cases, bands, faces, and bezels of these watches, which range from $30 to $75, are made of biodegradable products include bamboo, cotton, resin, and mineral crystals. 

While I doubt they’re much healthier for the environment than a $10 drug store Timex, you can at least pretend you’re heeding the Lorax while wearing one of these thanks to the eco-friendly bill of materials shown on their website.
You can buy these guys online and, sadly, they all feature quartz movements (but they come with mercury-free batteries).

673,More Evidence There’s No Bubble: VC Investments Were Flat in Q2,https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/22/more-evidence-theres-no-bubble-vc-investments-were-flat-in-q2/,2011/07/22,"
Dow Jones VentureSource released its second quarter numbers for the venture industry today, and there’s a reason they’re not dominating the headlines. They’re pretty boring: Overall investors put $8 billion into 776 deals in the US in the second quarter, a decrease of 5% in terms of invested cash and 2% in terms of deals. The median amount raised per deal was $5.2 million, up from $4.6 million a full year earlier. Yawn, right?
But the fact that the numbers are so unremarkable is what makes them interesting. It reinforces what people like me have been arguing for months: A handful of hot companies does not a bubble make.
The venture business has always been an outrageously lopsided one: 95% of the returns come from 5% of the deals. But while that was still true in the late 1990s, the overall numbers soared astronomically. That’s what happens in a bubble: A rising tide lifts all boats.
That’s clearly not happening here. In the public markets: LinkedIn has come down in price from its highs, but held on to a healthy price around $100 a share, as you’d expect from a 10-year-old, still growing company with few market comps that didn’t float many shares to begin with. Pandora is trading around $18 a share, closer to its 52-week low than its 52-week high. A smaller issue like Zillow has cooled off dramatically since its huge opening pop, but about 30% higher than its initial pricing. And again, Zillow is a pretty mature business. There’s some crazy volatility in the early days of these stocks, no question. But there doesn’t appear to be a broader market impact from any of them, and they each have quickly settled into a more rational price-territory. Not what you see in a bubble.
Let’s look at the secondary markets: Most of the attention still goes to the big five or six social media names. The real opportunity for this market to take off is creating liquidity for the companies “below the fold”– so to speak. Companies that have built solid $100 million in revenue or so businesses that are too small to go public and have employees who need some liquidity. There’s just no raging speculation there; no middle-America grandma buying shares in these names. Indeed, many of these companies are just now trying to wrap their heads around how they could best use the secondary markets to their advantage. This is why the secondary markets remain a pretty small phenomenon in the world of finance.
And now, we’ve got new numbers from the venture world that back up the same sentiment. When you dig a little deeper, the point is made further. Dealmaking in the healthcare space is down 12% and the capital invested is down 17%. Investments in biopharmaceuticals where decimated with a 25% deal drop; investments in medical devices were flat. Software-related companies were a relative brightspot in healthcare but deals were only up by 5%.
Likewise, the cash going into clean tech took a nose-dive in the second quarter. The sector raised $556 million for 29 deals, less than half the cash that 30 clean tech companies raised in the second quarter of 2010. This in the year John Doerr predicted cleantech would finally start to produce those Netscape-moment-like IPOs. Doerr is one of the smartest investors in the industry. You’d think in a raging bubble, his prediction would have been easy to prove true. Instead, the category looks colder than ever. Many VCs seem to be wondering whether the cynics were right back in the early-to-mid-2000s when they said that cleantech is too capital intensive and long-term to payoff in a modern venture capital ecosystem dominated by the instant gratification of the consumer Web.
Even enterprise software– a sector with some bonafide hot names and recent liquidity– had a slight dip in overall activity. One hundred and twenty-five companies raised $1 billion, which represented a 15% increase in capital over last year, but there was a 3% drop in deal making overall.
Now, did consumer services do well? Of course. But that’s easily skewed by just a handful of mega-financings. Indeed, the numbers showed the increase was mostly in cash, not overall deals. Capital raised by consumer companies jumped 51% over the second quarter of 2010, but deal making was up just 7%.
When you dig in deeper, the sub-category that includes social media, entertainment and consumer Web only saw a pop of 25% in cash raised over a year ago, and saw a slight drop in deal making activity. In aggregate, consumer Web companies raised less than $1 billion in the quarter. Clearly a few big mega-financings are driving those numbers, and there’s not even enough of them to lift the top line numbers.
I’ve said it before, I’ll say it now and I’ll likely keep saying it: A handful of surging companies with heady valuations do not constitute a macro-economic phenomenon. That constitues, at worst, a handful of really overvalued companies. The only thing to suggest Silicon Valley is in a bubble are the headlines, because the numbers just still aren’t there.

674,Nissan Adds New Features To The Leaf For 2012 Including A Higher Price,https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/19/nissan-adds-new-features-to-the-leaf-for-2012-jacks-up-the-price/,2011/07/19,"
Consumers have spoken and Nissan has listened. The 2012 Nissan Leaf will now pack more standard features — and a noticeably higher price. Starting July 25 the second model year Leaf will be available for order in the Southeastern United States and Illinois. Consumers with existing reservations have first dibs, though. That is if those consumers are still on board after they see the new price.
The SV trim level is jumping from $33,720 to $35,200 with the SL trim level increasing from $34,650 to $37,250. The higher price is likely caused by the new standard features on both models. A cold weather package will now come standard and feature a battery warmer, heated steering wheel, and front and rear heated seats. All SL trim level vehicles will also come equipped with a DC fast charge port, which allows the vehicle to be charged to 80% in 30 minutes from a 480V station.
Even with the features, the new price puts the Leaf in the Chevy Volt range. GM recently dropped the price of the Volt a bit and it now features a $40,280 MSRP. Both the Leaf and Volt still qualify for up to a $7,500 tax credit. When that’s considered, the Leaf is still available for less than $30k, although just barely.
I’m not so sure my review of the Leaf would have been so enthusiastic if the Leaf featured these new prices. The heated seats and steering wheel should decrease the battery’s draw by reducing the need for the traditional heater, but I’m not sure the new features justify the higher price.

PRESS RELEASE
NISSAN TO LAUNCH ALL-ELECTRIC LEAF AS UPGRADED 2012 MODEL IN NEW U.S. MARKETS
Nissan North America Inc. is expanding availability of the all-electric Nissan LEAF to U.S. consumers for the 2012 model year, with upgrades based on feedback from the thousands of owners who already have driven several millions of miles in the first 100-percent electric car for the mass market.
The Nissan LEAF, enriched with additional standard equipment including quick charging and cold-weather features for the 2012 model year, now will be available for order in the Southeastern United States and Illinois.
“Many enthusiastic consumers have eagerly anticipated ordering a Nissan LEAF of their own, and now we can make zero-emissions mobility a reality in more markets,” said Brian Carolin, senior vice president, Sales and Marketing, Nissan North America. “In response to direct feedback from Nissan LEAF owners, the features that customers want most will come standard on the 2012 Nissan LEAF – including quick charging and cold-weather features.”
Nissan on July 25 will open up the ordering process to consumers with existing reservations in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and Washington, D.C.
After the prioritized ordering phase for existing reservations in those markets, Nissan on Aug. 4 will open new reservations and orders to the general public, both in these new markets, as well as places where the Nissan LEAF already has been on sale (Arizona, California, Hawaii, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington). Expected delivery of the first 2012 Nissan LEAFs will begin in the fall.
The MY12 vehicle features product enhancements that incorporate feedback from early LEAF drivers, including standardizing the most popular options. These features include:


DC Fast Charge capability standard on Nissan LEAF SL: The vast majority of MY11 consumers have opted for the DC fast charge port, which allows the vehicle to be charged at 480V – reducing charging time to under 30 minutes for charging the vehicle to 80 percent from a fully depleted state. As DC fast charge stations proliferate across the country, Nissan expects this feature to become even more popular. For 2012, fast-charging capability will be standard on the SL trim level.

Cold weather features standard on Nissan LEAF: As the Nissan LEAF rolls out to U.S. markets with colder climates, cold weather features become standard equipment on all trim levels of the Nissan LEAF. These include a battery warmer, heated steering wheel, and heated seats in both the front and rear.

The manufacturer’s suggested retail price of the 2012 Nissan LEAF is $35,200 for the SV trim level, and $37,250 for the SL trim level. The monthly lease price will begin at a highly competitive $369.
Nissan will expand into additional new markets as the year continues. In the fall, orders from existing reservations and new reservations will begin in Connecticut, Colorado, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York. By the end of the year, Delaware, Indiana, Louisiana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island will be added as markets where the Nissan LEAF will be available for order.
More than 4,000 Nissan LEAFs have been delivered to U.S. customers, and Nissan, as it begins the next phase of the launch, continues to learn from them. While 82 percent have never previously owned a Nissan, a full 75 percent considered no other vehicle than the Nissan LEAF in their purchase decision. On a whole, these early adopters report that they are using the Nissan LEAF as their primary car, and driving it far more than was originally anticipated. These consumers, most of whom are highly educated and have high income levels, are technologically savvy, environmentally conscious, and consider themselves advocates for electric-car technology.

“In short, we need to reinvent the toilet.” That’s what Sylvia Mathews Burwell, president of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s Global Development Program, recently declared. She was speaking at the AfricaSan Conference in Kigali where she called on called donors, governments, the private sector, and NGOs to reinvent the toilet. Yep, the toilet.
The idea is noble. The majority of the developing world does not have access to flush toilets. As Burwell points out, no other innovation in the last 200 years has saved lives and improved health as the flush toilet but the defecation revolution only reached one-third of the world. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation hope to rekindle the fire and improve the life of untold millions.
The foundation is standing behind its call to arms with $42 million. The aim is to improve the capture and storage of waste, as well as turn it into some usable like energy, fertilizer and fresh water. These new grants join the foundation’s commitment to Water, Sanitation & Hygiene which now total $265 million.
Of course it’s not going to be easy. More than 2.6 billion people are lacking a proper toilet, but more importantly, a proper waste disposal infrastructure. A next-gen toilet would have to be sustainable, hygienic, but yet not reliant on sewers. The end-all goal would be a device that actually converted the waste into fuel or even safe drinking water.
This innovation challenge joins the United Nations’ 2015 Millennium Development Goals to cut in half the number of people who do not have access to basic sanitation. The World Health Organization states that proper sanitation doesn’t just counter health concerns. It also increases productivity, reduces health care costs and every $1 invested can be worth $9 in the backend.
So inventors and tinkers, you’ve heard the call. It’s time to start building a better shitter.

Solar@Work hopes to sign on at least 20 building owners in the San Francisco area by the end of the year, which could translate to as much as 2 megawatts of solar power.
While the program is innovative in simplifying solar for commercial buildings, it is not the first to harness group buying power for solar. 1Bog has a similar model for home-based solar installations, and SolarMosaic provides a crowdfunding platform for bringing solar to community buildings such as schools and churches.
The group buying model could discount the panels by 10-15% and reduce the cost of administrative fees by as much as 75%. That doesn’t sound like a steal by consumer group buying standards, but given the price tag on solar panels, it could add up to significant savings. The city says the high upfront cost of solar is the main barrier to entry into solar for most commercial property owners.
San Mateo’s SolarCity won the bid to provide the panels, and participating businesses are expected to pay less for solar than what they pay for power from the grid. Currently, commercial buildings fewer than four stories are eligible to participate in the program. If the pilot is successful, it could be expanded to other parts of the country, or even globally.

677,Sony Plans To Make Batteries For Electric Vehicles,https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/13/sony-plans-to-make-batteries-for-electric-vehicles/,2011/07/13,"
There is probably no one left doubting that electric vehicles will be a huge market in the future, and now it seems that Sony is agreeing, too. The company yesterday announced it will start making lithium-ion batteries specifically for electric cars and hybrids “from the middle of this decade”.
A Sony VP said his company expects demand for such batteries to grow drastically in the years to come, adding big S is ready to build dedicated plants in Japan and elsewhere if necessary. Details are scarce at this point, but a first battery prototype for electric vehicles that was shown to the press yesterday measures 257 x 182mm and apparently boasts a long life.
According to reports in various Japanese newspapers from today, Sony has already started offering its batteries to major electric car makers in Japan and elsewhere.

678,Printable Solar Cells Could Lead To A More Robust Energy Supply,https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/12/printable-solar-cells-could-lead-to-a-more-robust-energy-supply/,2011/07/12,"
MIT professors Karen Gleason and Vladimir Bulovic, along with a team of students, have created a printed solar cell that can “print” solar cells onto paper or fabric, thereby allowing for foldable and rollable cells that do not lose their conductivity.
Building solar cells used to require high temperatures and precluded the use of paper and fabric. Now, however, sub-120 degree Celsius temperatures and vapor-based printing techniques mean that you could place the material on almost anything. Rather than having a substrate of glass or other material, this method allows for manufacturers to reduce materials costs and resource use. This also reduces installation costs as you could, feasibly, lay this on a flat surface like a roof and connect to the mains.
Sadly, these solar cells aren’t yet particularly efficient, topping out at about 1%. Plans are in the works to improve this technology considerably over the next few years.

679,Power To The People,https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/10/power-to-the-people/,2011/07/10,"
As I type this, a UPS beeps furiously behind me, over the growl of half-a-dozen diesel generators on the street outside. I’m in an Internet café in Leh, a city nestled in a Himalayan valley surrounded by 6,000-metre / 20,000-foot peaks, the fast-growing capital of India’s northernmost territory Ladakh. It’s clearly outgrown its electrical capacity; power cuts hit several times a day.
Power generation is a deeply unsexy but profoundly important subject in the developing world. Technology is busily transforming lives all around the globe even as you read this—but a dearth of reliable electricity is a massive obstacle even in major cities, much less faraway villages.
People do find various imperfect and ingenious ways to cope. I was once on a riverboat in Guatemala whose captain distributed newly powered phone batteries to inhabitants scattered along the river, and collected their old ones to charge when he returned to civilization. You’ll find stores selling small-scale solar power equipment in remote small towns throughout Uganda, and occasional microhydro generators in the Himalayas; and people everywhere burn through enormous (and toxic) amounts of scarce (and expensive) diesel to power generators when their lights go out.

But there has to be a better way: and, increasingly, there is. In particular, I’ve had my eye on Fenix International for awhile now. Their ReadySet battery has two cigar lighter and two USB outputs to charge radios, lights, and batteries, and can itself be recharged via solar, bicycle, or wall power. Plus, they’ve recently released a universal charger that can power up almost any lithium-ion battery via a USB plug. (I wish I’d known this before I’d set out on this trip; I could have left both of my camera-battery chargers at home.)
It gets better, and wackier. There is also this BioLite stove that charges your cell phone And the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation recently awarded $100,000 to a project that seeks to use soil microbes to power fuel cells, which, it is claimed, could be built from scratch, in a few minutes, for pennies. I have to confess I’m a little skeptical, but I’ll be watching with interest.
In the long run, of course, localized micropower projects aren’t enough for serious economic development; you need a sizable and stable electrical grid. But in the interim, a little power is a whole lot better than none, and can and does make a huge difference. So here’s hoping that those microbes are a megahit.

680,How Hydrostor Aims To Change The Power Game By Storing Energy Under Water,https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/09/hydrostor-power-storage-under-water/,2011/07/09,"
Editor’s note: Guest writer Joseph Puopolo is an entrepreneur and start-up enthusiast, who blogs on a variety of topics including green initiatives, technology and marketing.
There has been a fair bit of concern in recent years about the ability of our power plants to supply adequate electricity during periods of peak demand. Hydrostor, a Toronto-based company, is taking a different approach in offering a solution that allows plants to store their power using compressed air in underwater storage tanks.
More specifically, Hydrostor takes the excess energy created during periods of off-peak consumption and converts that energy into compressed air via an air compressor, which in turn inflates accumulators placed under the surface of a body of water. The depth of the water keeps the air at a constant pressure, helping to store the energy potential.
When power is required, the air is released through an expander and electricity is produced. Through the heat-exchanger, modern compressors and expanders, the system approaches adiabatic operation, achieving efficiencies over 70 percent.
This technology has the potential to address the intermittent nature of renewable energy, help decongest transmission and distribution lines, and create better efficiencies of existing generation.
To date, Hydrostor has relied heavily on government and research grants to get started. They are now seeking further funding from both private sources and government groups to expand. They are currently in the pilot stage of a number of projects.
The benefits are obvious—tapping into a store of power when consumers demand it, rather than constantly maintaining a higher-than-normal supply would create a more efficient network. Hydrostor estimates that over 50 percent of the world’s biggest load centers are located by water and would therefore be candidates for their system. If this model proves true, it would save billions of dollars and the years it takes to build new generators. Hydrostor is not looking to replace new generation projects, but merely to make the existing grid more effective and reliable.
The company was founded by Cameron Lewis in 2010 when he identified the need for a more efficient way to store electricity. Cameron estimates that the cost of storing energy using his system is 50 percent cheaper than storing electricity via batteries.
He came upon the idea while working at a wind farm in Northern Ontario, and saw the potential of power storage. Alternative power sources, such as wind, require some sort of power storage mechanism to create an augmented base load. For the uninitiated, “base load” refers to the minimum amount of power that a utility or distribution company must make available to its customers at any time. A base load is traditionally created by running plants 24/7 to generate the required energy.
One of the traditional knocks against renewable energy comes over the question of what to do when wind isn’t blowing or the sun isn’t shining, since demand for power never stops. Cost effective storage of that power would make it possible to create a reliable base load and enable smart grid technologies.
The ripple effect from this application would be widespread as there becomes new opportunities for energy arbitrage and increased viability for renewable projects near large bodies of water. One of the potential limiting factors of the success of Hydrostor will be its adoption at a larger scale.
All current projects are 1 to 4 Megawatts (MW) in design, while larger plants start in the hundreds of Megawatts. Cameron insists not only that this system can scale, but as soon as they have a demonstration facility to prove out costs to the industry, there can be large scale adoption across the industry.
Hydrostor is based in Toronto, Ontario Canada and is part of the MARS Cleantech Portfolio of companies.

681,BioLite Stove Charges Your Phone While Cooking Your Dinner,https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/08/biolite-stove-charges-your-phone/,2011/07/08,"
Wood-burning stoves aren’t known for being particularly efficient, and their smoke not only contains high carbon emissions but causes health risks to those who inhale it. A portable design from BioLite aims to tackle this problem and turn the stove into a cell phone charger in the process.
The stove converts heat energy into electricity, powering a small fan to improve the wood’s combustion. Beyond this, one to two watts are available to charge a cell phone or LED light via a USB port.
The company sees two markets for their stove: Families in developing countries, and avid backpackers and campers. BioLite will release the CampStove version first, in spring of 2012. They hope profits from this product will help subsidize the cost of the HomeStove model for families in developing countries.

 BioLite claims to require half the amount of wood as an open fire and to cut smoke emissions by as much as 95%. Because billions of people depend on wood as cooking fuel, the stove has potential to improve health and, perhaps, slightly curb deforestation.
The CampStove model weighs just under two pounds and boils a liter of water in less than four minutes. A variety of materials can be used to power it, including sticks, pine cones, dung, rice husks and underbrush. This could be convenient for campers tired of carrying cans of gas or petroleum to power their stoves.
BioLite has already won awards for its designs, including the St. Andrews Prize for the Environment and first place in the 2010 Sustainable Brands Innovation Open.
BioLite’s COO Jonathan den Hartog explains how the stove works:

682,"Clean Urban Energy Raises $7 Million To ""Turn Buildings Into Batteries""",https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/07/clean-urban-energy-series-a-7-million/,2011/07/07," A Chicago startup Clean Urban Energy (CUE) raised $7 million in a series A round from Battery Ventures and Rho Ventures, the company announced today.
CUE’s software-as-a-service “exploits the thermal mass of commercial office buildings to make [them] more efficient,” according to a company press statement. The software was developed at the University of Colorado, which struck an exclusive, research and development and licensing agreement with CUE in 2008.
CUE claims it can lower buildings’ energy expenses by 15-30 percent through predictive modeling and optimization. The company can also aggregate energy demand across portfolios of buildings in cities, which means it has the potential to provide more macroscopic benefits.
Utilities and grid operators in big cities could use CUE technology to understand how their biggest customers are using electricity, and to introduce price elasticity in cities, encouraging commercial customers to shift power use away from high- to low-price (and lower demand) periods. Power generated outside of high demand periods generally causes less pollution, today. It also relieves power companies from the need to develop new power generating facilities— like coal or nuclear plants that nobody seems to want in their back yard.
With its new found capital, CUE aims to grow sales throughout cities in the U.S. including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Houston. Jason Matlof from Battery Ventures and Joshua Ruch from Rho Ventures are joining CUE’s board of directors with this round.

683,New Wifi Tech Could Double Your Phone’s Battery Life,https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/02/wifi-phone-battery-life/,2011/07/02,"
If you ever get the sense that someone on the wifi network you’re using is hogging all the juice, you may be right. Not only does sharing wifi with others downloading large files interfere with your enjoyment of the latest viral video, but it can majorly drain your battery as well.
A new solution from a Duke University computer science graduate student could alleviate your frustrations and potentially double your battery life by allowing your wifi device to “nap” until more bandwidth is available. This means you might have to wait a couple minutes to watch your video, but that could be a productivity boon anyway.
Justin Manwelier‘s SleepWell is a piece of software that helps maximize download efficiency by alerting the wifi device in your phone when a download is finished on a neighboring device. Most wifi devices have to “stay awake” while waiting for their turn to download, draining a good deal of battery in the process.
“The SleepWell-enabled wifi access points can stagger their activity cycles to minimally overlap with others, ultimately resulting in promising energy gains with negligible loss of performance,” Manwelier said in a statement.
The proximity of wireless devices affects their performance as well, with longer download times in more crowded areas, like cities. And, as cloud computing continues to grow, the reasons for connecting to wifi will increase. Putting a wifi-connected device on standby until a download from another device is complete increases both devices’ battery life.
No word yet on when SleepWell will be released, but once it is, we can all look forward to having more time to surf before seeking out an outlet.

684,"Luca Technologies Files To Go Public, Producing New Natural Gas From Old Wells",https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/29/luca-technologies-s1-natural-gas-tech/,2011/06/29," A Colorado cleantech venture, Luca Technologies, filed an S-1 today revealing its intention to go public, and raise up to $125 million (though that number could vary with the receptivity of the market by the time they actually go public).
The company stimulates microbes with a “proprietary formulation of nutrients,” in already-drilled natural gas wells, which enables the wells to produce more methane, the primary component of natural gas.
Luca Technologies owns and operates wells and infrastructure, then sells natural gas into existing markets. Its end users include power utilities, and government entities that use natural gas for power production.
Today, Luca’s chief executive Bob Cavnar (image, below) explained:

“Our technology activates the microbial communities that are already native in substrata [of existing natural gas wells]. We restore those substrata with water that has nutrients in it— like yeast extracts, some acetates, and stuff you could put into processed food today— which is fully consumed by the microbes, and then as a result, they produce natural gas. This does not require new wells or ‘fracking.’

There are tens of thousands of wells in places like Wyoming and New Mexico, about half of which have been shut down because they were depleted… If we can restore those, recycle and not degrade the water there, but still produce natural gas, that’s sustainable. I think of it like farming natural gas.
We’re definitely economic versus big shale gas wells that are drilled for millions of dollars. The more gas we can produce, the more independent we can become of Middle Eastern oil.”

Cavnar is a serial energy entrepreneur. He survived a gas well pit fire in 1981, which he wrote about on his blog DailyHurricane.com, and in his book Disaster On The Horizon.
Why is Luca considering the IPO? Cavnar said:
“We have a growth plan that involves acquisitions of wells. [Going public could] provide us a source of capital that can take us to that commercial trajectory where we can deploy our technology at scale…”

Today, Luca Technologies owns 1,350 wells in Wyoming. The company intends to expand there, and is looking for wells to revitalize in Alabama, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Appalachia. The company’s venture backers include: Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, One Equity Partners, Oxford Bioscience Partners, and BASF Venture Capital.

 SoloPower— a manufacturer of flexible, thin-film solar cells and modules— has raised another $43.7 million in an equity round this month, according to a new SEC filing. Investors in the round include: Greentech Capital in New York, and Thomas Weisel Partners in San Francisco. Earlier investors in the SoloPower include: Hudson Clean Energy Partners, Crosslink Capital, Convexa, and Firsthand.
In February this year, SoloPower locked a $197 million loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Loan Programs Office to build a “facility that, when completed and at full capacity, is expected to produce approximately 400MW of thin-film Photovoltaic (PV) modules annually,” according to a company press statement.
Based in San Jose, SoloPower is currently building its largest manufacturing plant (with the aforementioned funds) in Oregon. The company expects to spend $364 million on building the plant, and to employ about 500 people, full-time, once the facility is running at full capacity.
The company uses a roll-to-roll electroplating processes to manufacture its roll-up solar panels, a technique it has claimed will keep the costs of its CIGS (or thin-film) solar panels competitive versus other technologies on the market. While SoloPower has attracted a lot of cash and support, it faces stiff competition from Chinese manufacturers like Trina Solar, and public companies like First Solar, also in the thin-film game.

686,"IBM ""Buildings Whisperer"" Dave Bartlett On The Dumb Ways We Waste Energy",https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/27/ibm-intelligent-buildings-mgmt-solution-tctv/,2011/06/27," 



IBM’s Smarter Planet division released a new solution recently that can make buildings energy efficient— even if they are huge and 100 years old like the company itself. Vice president of the Smarter Buildings division at IBM, Dave Bartlett, visited TechCrunch TV to talk about the stupid ways that people waste energy in medium to large buildings, and how the company’s new Intelligent Building Management solution can change that.
According to an IBM press statement:
“Buildings consume 42 percent of all energy worldwide; energy costs represent about 30 percent of a building’s total operating cost— up to 50 percent of energy and water are often wasted. By 2025, buildings will be the number one consumer of energy in the world. IDC Energy Insights estimates that the global Smart Building market was $3.1 billion for 2010 and is expected to grow to $10.2 billion by 2015.”

To address this rampant power consumption, IBM’s new “Intelligent Building Management” solution does something with all the data from smart devices that have proliferated through the years. Sensor makers like Honeywell, Siemens, Eaton and Johnson Controls have made everything from refrigerators and water heaters, to computer labs and gymnasiums “smart,” Bartlett pointed out, so now it’s time to give people using them an easy way to read and act on the data they transmit.
Known as “the buildings whisperer” in retrofit and construction circles, Bartlett further explained:
“We’ve packaged up some recommended rule sets and technology [that can] essentially read a building, and say ‘if this is happening, do that.’ Customers can add their own rules, but we are taking what we’ve learned from working with partners and at our own campus [in Rochester] to be able to share general best practices, and make them easy to follow.”

One problem that IBM’s new solution diagnoses and eliminates in buildings is called “concurrent heating and cooling.” That’s where occupants have the heat on in one part of the building, but the air conditioning on somewhere else. It’s more common than you’d think, Bartlett reported, and it’s generally a big un-necessary waste of power.

IBM’s solution is being used to control energy consumption and costs at the Cloisters museum in New York City, at Boston University, and Tulane’s campus in New Orleans (image, right). The company is reaching out to everyone from neighborhood residents, to building owners and local power providers to figure out where the most energy goes in such buildings, where it can be safely reduced, and which systems maintenance tasks can be automated, leaving building owners and operators to focus their time and money on more critical repairs and upgrades.
Previously, IBM used its own industrial and commercial buildings as a test lab of sorts. According to the company’s new, sustainability reports, the Intelligent Building Management solution saved IBM’s Rochester campus— which consists of three million square feet inside of 35 interconnected buildings— 8 percent on energy used, year over year.
IBM’s move into smarter buildings technology could prove a challenge for growing startups like EcoFactor, Retroficiency and Hara. Then again, IBM could become one of the top buyers of their services, or possibly an acquirer of these type of tech ventures.

687,"These Car Prototypes Built By Kids Can Do Close To 2,000 Miles Per Gallon",https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/25/car-prototypes-kids/,2011/06/25,"

What’s more impressive than a car that can do over a thousand miles per gallon? One that was designed by school kids.
In the UK, students from regional schools and universities took part in the annual Mileage Marathon Challenge near Leicester, England, each team vying to set new gas mileage efficiency records in a race around a track. Cars were allowed to coast, but had to maintain a minimum speed of 15 miles per hour. Students worked on the vehicle prototypes, many in partnership with design and engineering firms.

The winner of the 20-team competition, pictured above, was a vehicle driven by 14-year-old Sam Chapman-Hill, which reached a 1,980 mile-per-gallon efficiency. Its aerodynamic design, reminiscent of something from a sci-fi film, weighs just under 100 pounds and is made mostly of plastic reinforced by glass.
One driver, 11-year-old Kitty Foster, completed her race in a model that used a Cambridge Design Partnership oxygen concentrator and micro-diesel engine to reach 1,325 miles per gallon:

The car was also tracked using GPS to optimize its strategy during the race, communicating to Kitty when the perfect moment to stop the engine and start coasting arrived. Those with smartphones were encouraged to track the car’s speed and location during the race.
The Challenge is organized to excite students about tech and engineering, and the prototypes built are unlikely to be mass produced anytime soon. They do demonstrate what’s possible, however, and could inspire car manufacturers to keep innovating towards greater efficiency.

The second phase of the challenge sought green tech ideas to power the home, specifically addressing household energy efficiency including management software, appliances and air conditioning; and renewable power, from solar, wind, hydro and biomass.
The 10 new concepts that received funding from the challenge include Ember, GMZ Energy, Hara, Nuventix, On-Ramp Wireless, Project Frog, SunRun, Viridity Energy, VPhase, and WiTricity.
GE says it will commit an additional $20 million in funding  for scaling and commercializing ideas from the Challenge through a new ecomagination Innovation Council.

689,Google Invests $102 Million More Into California's Alta Wind Energy Center,https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/22/google-invests-102-million-more-into-californias-alta-wind-energy-center/,2011/06/22," According to an official company blog post today, Google is increasing its investment into California’s Alta Wind Energy Center (AWEC) by $102 million, bringing its total investment in the renewable energy facility to $157 million.
The AWEC is being developed by Terra-Gen Power, primarily. The first development within the massive facility is the Alta-Oak Creek Mojave Project. Google’s latest funding commitment would go to build an extension at the facility. The AWEC has a transmission line, the Tehachapi Renewable Transmission Project, dedicated to it which makes it distinct from many, large-scale renewable energy projects that have been proposed in the U.S.
Over the years, Cape Wind faced challenges winning public opinion and regulatory approvals due to a lack of a transmission line that can send power generated offshore back to Nantucket or Boston, two large markets nearby. In 2010, as reported by Reuters then, Google, along with cleantech investment firm Good Energies and Japans’ Marubeni Corp., agreed to take an equity position in Cape Wind’s transmission line.
This year, Google has invested about $700 million into renewable energy projects, according to press statements by Rick Needham, the company’s director of green business operations.
Google also recently dedicated funds to financing SolarCity residential solar development, and to other large-scale solar and wind projects including at Ivanpah a solar power tower project in Nevada, and Shepherd’s Flat, the wind farm in Oregon.
A hearty tax appetite is partly responsible for Google’s move to become a clean energy financier of this magnitude. Google will reap the benefits of many tax credits currently available to investors in clean energy in the U.S.
Supporting clean energy and new additions to the grid could also help Google maintain a stronghold in search and big data; users will inevitably search for and process bulk amounts of information about energy production and use via Google, its APIs and apps as new sources of energy get plugged into the grid, and as utilities are forced by regulators to report more carefully on their environmental impact.

690,"To Help Companies Curb Their Environmental Impact, Enablon Raises $15 Million",https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/22/enablon-15-million-series-a-funding-etf/,2011/06/22," A French software company with U.S. headquarters in Chicago, Enablon, has raised a series A round of $15 million from the Environmental Technology Fund (ETF) in the U.K. Enablon’s enterprise software helps companies understand how much water, energy, chemicals and other resources they use, and how much they waste or pollute so that ultimately they can defray costs— financial and otherwise— associated with their environmental footprint.
In April, Enablon gained accreditation from the Carbon Disclosure Project, an independent not-for-profit organization that collects climate change data from thousands of companies. CDP maintains a comprehensive database of corporate greenhouse gas emissions and climate change information, and helps governments and corporations understand the risks of greenhouse gas emissions.
According to a CDP report earlier this month:


“[Of 42 of the world’s major cities] 93 percent recognize significant physical risk from climate change and 79 percent of cities believe that the physical impacts of climate change could directly or indirectly threaten the ability of local businesses to operate successfully.
Cities are feeling the immediate impact of climate change, with 43 percent identifying that they are already dealing with the effects of climate change in their areas…[including] temperature changes resulting in more hot days, increased frequency of heat waves, more intense rainfall, increased severity of storms and floods and rising sea levels…62 percent of [these] cities are establishing climate change action plans and 57 percent are adopting greenhouse gas reduction targets, today.”

The trend among city governments should compel companies that seek to do business there to report more about their emissions, which is good news for Enablon in terms of increases in demand. The company faces fierce competition, however, as the field grows ever more crowded with energy-management and carbon focused software providers like: Hara, ENXSuite and Silver Spring Networks in North America.
 Enablon’s client roster includes more than 250 companies among them: Accenture, Nike, UPS and American Airlines.
Chief executive and co-founder of Enablon, Phil Tesler, explained in a phone interview:

“Our typical customers have been global 2,000 or multi-billion dollar businesses with offices in multiple locations. Reporting has become increasingly important to them, internally and externally.
Depending on the breadth and depth of reporting a company wants to do, Enablon software and systems can be installed and running within as little as two weeks, or an install may take as long as 9 months.
We will use the series A funding to work on some cloud computing initiatives, and to internationalize. We have experienced very strong growth in Europe and the U.S. and now we need to replicate this in Asia.”

The company’s chief executive and co-founder, Mike Cheney spoke at the Renewable Energy Finance Forum in New York, today revealing a goal to help bring more than 1,000 megawatts of clean energy to the U.S.
A managing director with CleanPath Ventures, John Balbach (formerly a managing partner at The Cleantech Group) told TechCrunch in a phone interview on Tuesday:


“We’re in a new era in cleantech investment where it’s less about innovation and more about financial solutions to put things in the ground at scale. The build out of solar in the U.S. is just hitting a stride like it did in Europe 5 years ago. We see tremendous potential in emerging markets in the U.S., and just south and north of the border.
We will invest where solar power can be price competitive [with traditional energy sources]. Exactly where we decide to invest will be influenced by a number of factors. The regulatory framework is important, but so are the natural resources and issues like transmission, population and solar resources in a given area. That mix, like the economic equation for solar, changes over time.
Texas will be a very interesting market, as will the Midwest over the next five years. These areas have gone through some wind development, already.”

Serial solar financiers Matt Cheney and Karin Berardo started CleanPath after spinning out and selling an earlier energy fund, MMA Renewable Ventures to Fotowatio in 2009. Fotowatio is a solar-focused fund and developer of utility-scale power generating facilities based in Spain, with a significant role in developing solar projects throughout Europe and Australia.
CleanPath’s new fund will provide capital, credit and expertise in large-scale solar photovoltaics facilities to: project developers, utilities, builders, businesses, governments and land owners primarily in the U.S. The projects it funds will range in size from 5 to 100 megawatts and will use photovoltaic equipment rather than other, less-tested solar technology for large-scale facilities like BridgeSource’s solar power towers.

The thing is, OnGreen can’t take direct credit for any of that funding. The site still lacks accreditation and other features that will enable it to track its impact, and act as a direct broker down the line. For now, it is just a free marketplace for deals and investors.

The incoming CTO, Mark Richards, explained:


“While a green tech marketplace may have content that’s very different from [the entertainment content] I’ve worked with before, this is about scaling and becoming more international. I’ll be ensuring that OnGreen can handle multiple users in any location, and making sure we maintain high performance and reliability as we grow.
The technology foundation of OnGreen does not rely on an out of the box social code base. It’s all being developed in-house, with an extensive number of custom Drupal modules. We’ll be growing a full-time tech team to support and expand on this, both in China and the U.S.”

693,Good World Games' MyConservationPark Helps You Save Endangered Species,https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/19/good-world-games-myconservationpark-helps-you-save-endangered-species/,2011/06/19,"
Combining social games with a cause has become a popular way to engage game players on Facebook with raising money for various philanthropic causes. For example, Zynga has raised funds via its games for the earthquake relief efforts in both Japan and Haiti over the past few years. Startup Good World Games is developing Facebook games devoted purely to marrying the power of causes with the viral explosion of social gaming. The startup’s first Facebook game, MyConservationPark, allows you to protect an endangered animal from environmental and human threats while enriching the park with fauna and flora to create a sustainable habitat.
There are 2 modes of Play in the game: Play and Decorate. In Play mode, new challenges constantly appear that you must overcome in order to save and protect your endangered species (i.e. there’s a fire in your park, hire a firefighter to put it out) In this mode, your eco-system and hero levels are affected by your success in conquering these challenges.
In Decorate mode, you can create a haven for your species and add people and creatures, trees, food and water, watchtowers and sheds, and arrange your park as you see fit. You can purchase virtual good such as park rangers, native species such as antelopes, structures such as watchtowers and camps, flora (indigenous trees and bushes), water and insects.
All purchases of virtual goods directly benefit Good World Games’ non-profit partners with 15% of in-game purchase revenue donated to select causes. Each park benefits a different partner, which include Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, Sea Shepherd, Wildaid and Orangutan Outreach. You can see what percent of revenue from your game interactions have been donated as well.
Each park contains species native to its location, with different art and challenges. And top scorers in game will, on a periodic basis, receive real world rewards such as an all-expenses paid trip to help (as a volunteer) one of the non-profit partners in the field.
Eventually Good World Games plans to roll out similar games that allow Facebook users to play games towards social good.

694,Bill And Melinda Gates Foundation Grants $1.5M To Turn Human Waste Into Biofuel,https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/17/bill-and-melinda-gates-foundation-grants-1-5m-to-turn-human-waste-into-biofuel/,2011/06/17,"
Two of many challenges developing countries face are unsafe water and a lack of affordable energy. With the help of a new $1.5 million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Ghana may be able to combine these lacks into an asset in the form of biodiesel.
The grant, for a “Next-Generation Urban Sanitation Facility” in the country’s capital of Accra, will turn human waste from sewage into biodiesel and methane that can be used as fuel.
The project not only produces energy from waste, but tackles a major sanitation problem common in cities that are unable to pipe sewage to treatment plants. Bacteria in sewage can easily make its way into water sources used for cooking, drinking and irrigation, leaving locals, especially children, susceptible to dying of diarrhea-related diseases such as cholera.
Columbia University’s Dr. Kartick Chandran will lead the project. In collaboration with Moses Mensah, a Chemical Engineering professor at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, and Ashley Murray founder and director of Waste Enterprisers, the team will build a biorefinery to recover energy from fecal matter, turning it into a useful resource instead of something to be inconveniently discarded. When completed, the project will reduce fecal sludge in Accra’s water supply and offer an affordable energy source to its residents.
The Gates Foundation estimates that 2.5 million people, or half of the world’s developing world population, doesn’t have access to safe sanitation. Chandran is familiar with Ghana, having worked for two years as faculty advisor to the an Engineers without Borders team there.
This isn’t the first time fecal matter has been used to create energy, but it could be a step towards a brighter future for areas struggling with wastewater sanitation and high fuel costs.
Here is video of Chandran discussing some of his wastewater treatment research.

695,"Brand-To-Fan Connector, Crowdtap, Hits $1 Million Revenue With 115,000 Members",https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/17/crowdtap-connects-brands-to-fans-jun-2011/,2011/06/17," A New York City startup that helps brands connect with and reward their fans via Facebook, Crowdtap, recently crossed the $1 million revenue mark for 2011, with 115,000 active members and about 50 major brand clients, chief executive officer Brandon Evans reported today.
Crowdtap members earn redeemable points for taking “brand actions” like: completing “quick hit” surveys, voting in a poll, participating in a live-online discussions or sharing brand-related content with a few friends via social media and the Crowdtap platform. The points that Crowdtap gives its members can be redeemed for an array of real world incentives, among them: an Amazon.com gift card, or a cash donation to a charity chosen from the company’s list of approved organizations. These range from environmental non-profits like the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and The Nature Conservancy to The American Red Cross, Autism Speaks and Invisible Children.
Crowdtap requires that users donate five percent of their points to a charity of their choice. They can give more if they choose. Since launch, users have racked up $20,000 worth of points in donations to these charities (not all of that has been paid out, yet). Evans said his company aims to give users more and more choices over time; he is constantly adding causes and charities to the list.
To prevent Crowdtap members, who are brand fanatics, from turning into spammers the site only rewards points to users for sharing brand-related content that they “like” with up to four friends online. The points are doled out to the sharer once the recipient rates the content they’ve received.
Users who agree to either create content about a brand — like a video they made about their latest shopping trip to Old Navy— or who volunteer to host a party where they’ll pass around sample products provided by the brand, can gain a stronger reputation (and badges) within Crowdtap. Users with a higher reputation score become eligible for product freebies and other incentives that new or lighter users won’t get.

Marketers and media planners are embracing Crowdtap, Evans explained, because:
“The motivation we provide is not to get someone to simply post something. We motivate members to participate in a [brand’s] community and with our site in a way that’s as authentic as it can be. We can provide measurement that’s granular. We factor in proximity, intensity, engagement, and memory— time users spent with a brand in addition to [how many users the brand] reaches.”

[Ed’s note: See the screenshot below for a look at the marketer-side of Crowdtap.]
More than 75,000 of Crowdtap’s users signed up after the company launched its site in March at SxSWi, Evans said. The company charges its clients per interaction— if a user agrees to share a brand’s content, or take other actions, that generates a fee for Crowdtap. The number of brand-sponsored actions that Crowdtap members have completed in May 2011 totaled 385,000 Evans said. About 50 major brands and agencies are currently using Crowdtap, ranging from AOL (which owns TechCrunch) to Diesel, GolinHarris public relations, Pinkberry, Entenmanns and the ad agency Mullen.
Crowdtap ran a poll in May 2011— of the type it would run on behalf of an automotive brand or environmental group— for TechCrunch Greentech. We asked the site’s users who are parents: when would you buy an electric vehicle (if ever)?

696,"Cleaner Flight: Virgin America's Efficient Engines, UOP Biofuels Go Transatlantic",https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/16/cleaner-flight-virgin-america-cfm-uop/,2011/06/16,"
Air travel promises to become cleaner, if industry actions ahead of the huge, annual Paris Airshow are any indication… 
Branson Still Backing Biofuels
Virgin America— a company that’s been reporting on its own greenhouse gas emissions since 2009— ordered $1.4 billion worth of new, super fuel-efficient engines from CFM International the companies announced on Wednesday. The move should help keep energy costs down, and reduce the negative environmental impacts of air travel by Virgin America as the company triples the size of its fleets, as promised back in January.
According to a joint press statement from the companies, CFM’s LEAP Engine will power 30, brand new Airbus A320 aircraft slated for delivery to Virgin America in 2016, and CFM’s 56-5B engines will power 30 of Virgin America’s current-edition Airbus A320-line aircraft.
Promoting the deal, CFM Engine and its parent companies GE and Snecma, agreed to purchase carbon offsets via Carbonfund.org for the first 5,000 flights booked on Virgin America online, following the announcement. Virgin America also threw a one-day fare sale.
Virgin America claims that in pairing the A320neo and the LEAP engine, it will deliver 15 percent better fuel efficiency and 50 percent greater reductions in NOx emissions, over levels that environmental regulators require today. The company also forecasts that it will save $1.9 million per aircraft per year in fuel costs at current fuel prices.
It’s worth noting that while the airline bets on efficiency technology, it has also invested in biofuels. The company tested its first flights using at least some biofuel in 2008 (as TriplePundit reported then).
Sir Richard Branson, famed founder of the Virgin group of companies, also backed Gevo a biofuels company that went public back in February. Virgin plans to use at least ten percent drop-in biofuels, or plant-based fuels that work with existing engines, by 2020.

Boeing Going To Paris On Camelina-based Biofuels
Jet biofuels made by Honeywell UOP from a non-food crop, camelina plants, will power a Boeing 747-8 freighter en route to the Paris Air Show on June 20th. The companies announced their plans today, while members of the U.S. house and senate were pushing to end ethanol subsidies and the U.S. Department of Agriculture secretary Tom Vilsack was campaigning to save the subsidies which bring money to farms large and small.
The Boeing plane will use not corn ethanol, of course, but a blend of 15 percent camelina-based biofuel, mixed with 85 percent kerosene jet fuel, which is the traditional jet fuel (a.k.a. Jet A). Boeing Captains Keith Otsuka and Rick Braun, along with Cargolux Captain Sten Rossby will pilot the historic 5,000-mile flight.
It’s kind of funny how Boeing is backing the use of plant-based fuels, here.
The company is still struggling to get its new line of efficient 787 Dreamliner planes (image, above) to market. These aircraft are supposed to burn 20 percent less fuel than other passenger planes of their size, and are lighter with more cargo space.
As Katie Johnston Chase at the Boston Globe recently reported: “The 787 is in the process of being certified by the Federal Aviation Administration and is expected to be delivered to its first airline, All Nippon Airways Co., in August or September. A total of 56 airlines, including United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, have placed orders for the 787.”

697,"EcoMotors And Generac Developing Fuel-Efficient, Backup Power Generators",https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/16/ecomotors-generac/,2011/06/16," EcoMotors struck a parntership with Generac (NYSE: GNRC) this week to jointly develop fuel-efficient, backup power generators.
Generac is a large manufacturer of backup power generators for home, light commercial and industrial use. The company went public in February 2010. When natural disasters strike, Generac and other companies that make backup power generators (like Honda, GE and Kohler) tend to experience sales and stock price increases.
EcoMotors is cleantech startup formed in 2008 and backed by Khosla Ventures and Bill Gates. The company designs and manufactures efficient combustion engines that could work anywhere gas or diesel power is typically used, like in cars and trucks, boats, tractors, planes and backup power generators.

EcoMotors claims its “opoc engines” are 15 to 50 percent more fuel efficient than traditional internal combustion engines, as well as smaller and lighter to boot.
Chief executive officer of EcoMotors, Don Runkle (who spoke at TechCrunch Disrupt in New York last month) explained the impact of the partnership with Generac to his business:

“We’re going to work with Generac to qualify the ‘EcoMotors opoc engine’ for applications in gen sets, or the power generation area. We’d expect to begin to see [generators equipped with our engines] on the market in 2013. We have engines in prototypes, now in a wide variety of applications.
Partnering with a market leader in generators— which is about an $8 billion market, compared to a larger market in automotive— we hope to get through development quickly.
It can be easier to get engines tested for this application because you don’t have to do crash [tests] to see what happens to an engine like you would with vehicles. Gen sets run at one speed, also. In the U.S. that’s 60 cycles per second, and in EU that’s 50 cycles per second. Whereas with automoative, marine and aerospace applications, you have the engine going up and down in speed, obviously. It is easier to calibrate for generators.”

Based in Allen Park, Mich., EcoMotors is currently generating some revenue from engineering services, but does not yet sell its opoc engines. In the first quarter of 2011, Waukesha, Wisc.-based Generac sales totaled $124 million, according to the company’s last available earnings report.

Runkle spoke about other partnerships and explained more about his company’s approach to clean vehicles backstage at TechCrunch Disrupt in NYC last month. Watch the video (or read the transcript) for more…

698,#Winning: EcoFactor Software Puts Thermostat On Auto-Pilot To Curb Energy Waste,https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/15/winning-ecofactor-software-puts-thermostat-on-auto-pilot-to-curb-energy-waste/,2011/06/15," EcoFactor, an energy efficiency startup based in Redwood City, Calif. was named a winner at the Utility Technology Challenge today in Boston. The other two winners were Ideal Power Converters and Power Tagging, according to a press release from the event.
EcoFactor’s flagship software as a service (SaaS) helps electricity consumers and utilities to diagnose and curb energy waste related to heating and cooling. This technology works with any kind of grid-enabled, or two-way thermostat. According to Scott Hublou, a senior vice president of product and a co-founder of EcoFactor, here’s how it helps curb energy waste:

“We look at the way outside weather conditions correlate with indoor heating and cooling needs at home. Then, we ask ‘how effective are your heaters or air conditioners at overcoming that?’ Once our system calculates and can understands the correlation, we can adjust the thermostat. We have an objective of reducing the energy required to keep the house comfortable. We can also help power companies reduce peak demand, and shift the load…”
Businesses that provide power, or energy management services to home owners— including cable operators and telecommunications providers, electric and gas utilities—  are EcoFactor’s current and targeted customers. EcoFactor is available to end users in 10 states through a combination of pilot and commercial programs today.
The company recently found that homes that put their heaters and air conditioners on auto-pilot— via EcoFactor pilot programs across the country, and one commercial program in Dallas, Texas— realized a 17 percent reduction in energy use related to heating and cooling, on average. According to the most recent available D.O.E. study, half of the average Americans’ home energy bill is spent on heating and cooling.
The Utility Technology Challenge was started in 2009 (with funding by the U.S. Department of Energy) by the Clean Technology & Sustainable Industries Organization (CTSI). EcoFactor competed against fifteen semifinalists, listed below:
    *  7 AC Technologies, Massachusetts (www.7actech.com)

699,It's Official! Oil And Gas Giant Total Now Owns $1.3 Billion Controlling Stake In SunPower,https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/15/total-sunpower-controlling-stake/,2011/06/15,"Total, the fossil fuels giant, just gave itself a renewable energy makeover by finishing up its $1.3 billion purchase of a majority stake in SunPower, the San Jose, Calif.-based designer and manufacturer of solar panels and systems.
SunPower sells its solar technology and services to customers of about any size, including at the residential, business, government and utility level.
Let’s put the scope of the Total-SunPower deal in perspective. According to research by the Cleantech Group and Deloitte, for all of 2010, venture investments in cleantech companies of any stripe worldwide totaled $7.7 billion across 715 deals, and the solar segment attracted 24 percent of those dollars. Worldwide venture investments in solar companies for 2010 totaled $1.83 billion across 117 deals. In 2009, venture investments in solar companies totaled $1.34 billion.
[Ed’s note: Cleantech VC money has never looked so Monopoly! The traditional oil and gas purse, on the other hand, looks bottomless.]
In a press statement about the SunPower acquisition, Total touched on its previous involvement in solar:
“Through its joint venture affiliates Tenesol and Photovoltech, Total has built expertise along the photovoltaic solar power chain to make this technology more reliable, efficient and competitive. Tenesol is a French solar panel manufacturer with an industrial footprint in Toulouse (France) and Cape Town (South Africa). Total is also a large minority shareholder in [U.S.-based solar technology businesses] Konarka and AE Polysilicon.”

The company is expected by industry insiders to reorganize its entire business, globally, around its latest acquisition.
With traditional energy companies like Total buying up solar at this level, and huge amounts of competition from Chinese solar manufacturers and developers, do U.S. startups and newly public companies in solar have a chance to survive without ceding control?
Cleantech Group chief executive Sheeraz Haji believes,

“We will see a number of winners in solar. In the U.S., category leaders like Brightsource and MiaSole will thrive as independent companies, while a number of others will struggle on their own and be acquired.
I do not see the SunPower acquisition as a sign of weakness, at all. They sold for a big premium and gained access to a huge new balance sheet, including a $1 billion debt facility that Total did through the equity deal.”


Making the case that worldwide demand will remain strong enough to support new entrants in solar (yes, even American ones) a report today from the International Energy Association (IEA) forecasts that “by 2050, solar photovoltaics will provide 11 percent of global electricity production.” That amount of solar power represents a potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by about 2.3 gigatons, equivalent to reducing emissions from electricity use from 253 million homes per year, nearly the combined populations of Russia and Japan the report said.

700,Could Efficiency 2.0 Eclipse Solar? CEO Tom Scarmellino Thinks So (TCTV),https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/14/efficiency-2-0-ceo-tctv/,2011/06/14," 



The founder of Efficiency 2.0, Tom Scarmellino, sat down with TechCrunch TV this week to talk about how his company motivates consumers to curb their power-hogging behavior at home, and what kind of impact that makes from an environmental perspective.
A New York City cleantech company, Efficiency 2.0 runs loyalty rewards programs on behalf of its clients, big electric companies that are legally required to convince customers to use energy more efficiently.
The Efficiency 2.0 platform crunches massive amounts of data— like homeowners’ demographic information, weather forecasts and more— to tailor power-saving tips, and reward offers for consumers that will matter enough, hopefully, to persuade them to make energy-related changes around the house.
Unlike OPower (perhaps the best-known brand in this space today) Efficiency 2.0 delivers its power saving suggestions mostly online, and is more about setting a personal best, than it is about outpacing your neighbors on energy efficiency.
Doing anything from installing a smart meter, to simply switching off the coffee maker the second the brew is done, can help get customers points and save money on their electricity bills. The points are redeemable for rewards like a $10 discount at Staples, or a gift card for Omaha Steaks. Efficiency 2.0 sets up some of the merchant partnerships, but also works with another NYC cleantech company, Recyclebank, to make the incentives possible.

Scarmellino confessed in the TCTV green room that one his worst indulgences, environmentally speaking, was eating too many steaks. That’s a lot of saved kilowatts, though. The CEO believes that with a majority of 120 million homes in the U.S. not yet participating in an energy efficiency program, Efficiency 2.0 could make an impact that’s “bigger than the entire solar industry to date,” in terms of mitigating pollution and more.

701,ClearEdge Power Wins $2.8 Million Grant To Evangelize Fuel Cells,https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/14/clearedge-power-pnnl-doe-grant/,2011/06/14," On Tuesday, ClearEdge Power— a cleantech startup that makes 5-kilowatt stationary fuel cells— announced that it won a $2.8 million grant from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to gets its technology out to the market more quickly. Targeted customers for ClearEdge Power include the owners and operators of hotels, groceries, schools, medical centers and fast food restaurants, among other light industrial power users.
The ClearEdge5 fuel cell (image, below) is about the size of a regular home refrigerator and produces power from natural gas. It is also designed to recycle the heat it generates for use within a facility where it is installed. Heat generated by the fuel cells’ power production can be harnessed, for example, to warm up a pool, a laundry room or the air in a building.
The PNNL grant project is part of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Fuel Cell Technologies Program, and is one of a slew of activities designed to: “support the development and deployment of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies, [domestically]” according to a PNNL press statement. Through the grant, PNNL funds up to 50 percent of the total project cost for each system ClearEdge Power installs.

Given $2.8 million in funding, ClearEdge Power agreed to install 38 systems for ten organizations that the company hand-picked because they were reputed sustainability leaders in their industries or geographic regions. As part of the deal, the organizations that get the half-priced systems and services agreed to allow PNNL access to their fuel cell’s performance data for five years [updated: Jun. 14, 2011 7:45 p.m. ET].
The grant is a first-of-its-kind award, according to PNNL project manager Mike Rinker. Most D.O.E. grants are to advance research and development and manufacturing, he explained.
Rinker’s team chose ClearEdge Power for the grant because, he said, “They had a system that was commercially available already in the 5-kilowatt to 100-kilowatt range, and could be deployed quickly.”
The ClearEdge5 uses an electrochemical process to convert natural gas (or propane) to electricity and heat. It’s a smaller unit than those offered by Bloom Energy, UTC Power or Fuel Cell Energy.
The company claims its systems: reduces the environmental impact of producing electricity by reducing carbon dioxide emissions by about 35 to 40 percent compared to traditional combustion power generation, and by avoiding the emission of volatile organic compounds, ash and particulates, to trace levels.
PNNL’s Rinker also noted:


“It’s hard to determine which sectors within the category of light industrial power users are the biggest consumers of energy from fossil fuels. It varies regionally, for one. Most companies in this category are grid-connected so they take what the utility can give them.
In Southern California and Northern California, a lot of that power comes from coal*. That’s why it makes sense to introduce businesses in this area, and in this category, or in areas that have access to a natural gas pipeline to fuel cell alternatives.
With companies like a 24-7 medical center, a hotel or a fast food restaurant that needs reliable electricity and heat, constantly, you can use both the heat and the power generated by a fuel cell to offset greenohouse gases, and make the case for the efficiency for this technology.
We’ll be starting to track the data in September this year.”

[*Ed’s note: coal is generally regarded as one of the most polluting forms of energy, if one of the more affordable, in the U.S.]
According to Mike Upp, vice president of marketing at ClearEdge Power, his company currently has 225 full-time employees, has so far sold 100 fuel cell systems and is headquartered in Hillsboro, Oregon with plans to expand operations on the east coast this year.

702,"Google Scaling Solar, Commits $280 Million To Finance SolarCity Installations",https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/14/google-scaling-solar-commits-280-million-to-finance-solarcity-installations/,2011/06/14," Google today announced a new partnership with SolarCity, committing $280 million from its coffers to finance SolarCity installations, namely solar rooftops for homes in North America.
The partnership brings Google employees a discount on residential solar installations and services from SolarCity. On a worldwide basis, according to the company’s last quarterly earnings report, Google employs about 26,300 full-time.
Earlier this month, SolarCity locked a commitment from U.S. Bancorp that put them past the $1 billion mark in terms of financing capacity. Google becomes the company’s seventh major financing partner.
Rick Needham, director of green business operations at Google wrote about the deal in a company blog post this morning:

“[At Google, we] believe the world needs a wide range of clean energy options in the future, each serving different needs. We’ve already invested in several large-scale renewable energy projects…We think ‘distributed’ renewable energy (generated and used right at home) is a smart way to use solar photovoltaic (PV) technology to improve our power system since it helps avoid or alleviate distribution constraints on the traditional electricity grid.”
Google also put $168 million in project financing into the BrightSource Ivanpah solar power tower project. Back in 2006, Google installed solar panels at its own Mountain View campus, too.
Google’s support of solar infrastructure dovetails nicely with Google Ventures’ investments in smart grid startups. Their portfolio includes Silver Spring Networks and Transphorm, for example. The more homes and businesses are rigged up with solar panels, and able to generate and distribute power back through the grid, the more data such companies will have to process on behalf of utilities.

703,ClarianLabs: Rethinking The Battery As A Tiny Engine,https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/14/rethinking-the-battery-clarian/,2011/06/14," An energy technology incubator, ClarianLabs in Seattle, has published a patent for a device called the Rotary Piston Generator (RPG) which the company hopes will challenge the idea of what batteries are, and how they’re used, especially in vehicles.
The RPG is a mechanical rather than chemical approach to portable energy storage. Its energy capacity is potentially ten times greater than a typical battery, company representatives wrote in an email exchange with TechCrunch. That depends on the kind of fuel it uses— the invention is essentially a very tiny, highly efficient engine.
ClarianLabs’ published patent shows the RPG contains: “induction armature that rotates around a fixed shaft inside a rotary piston.” As they rotate relative to one another, the parts generate electricity (kind of like a diesel engine).
The RPG doesn’t require a separate generator, starter or gearbox. It can ostensibly run on a variety of fuels, including: gasoline, kerosene, propane, natural gas, ethanol, methanol or hydrogen.
ClarianLabs is pre-revenue, with 5 employees. The company previously won GE’s Consumer Innovation Award in the 2010 Ecomagination Challenge, for its SmartBox Solar module design, which is a “plug-n-play” solar concept for the home. Basically, it’s a small solar panel you can plug your appliances into directly.
According to Chad Maglaque, president of ClarianLabs (and ClarianPower):
“We’re a technology developer and licensor, akin to a Dolby or a Dyson for cleantech. This is a very early stage technology. We are now looking for a partner to develop [it] — like the Department of Defense or the Department of Energy, an automobile or aerospace manufacturer. We think a natural for this would be in electric vehicles as a lightweight, compact range extender, something akin to a bike rack that you clip on or put in your trunk for a weekend trip.”

There isn’t any data that demonstrates this thing works, yet.
[Ed’s note: It’s always exciting to see new ideas to deliver more efficient portable power. While we can’t highlight every patent published, I selected this one because the company has a track record of winning awards and recognition on the cleantech competition circuit from judges in the field who know what’s commercially viable, better than I do.]

The investment was led by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (KPCB) and joined by GM Ventures, Mitsui & Co., Vision Ridge Partners and 88 Green Ventures.
According to a press statement today, Proterra will use its new funding to: complete federal testing of its buses; supply vehicles and systems to pilot fleets; and increase the number of buses and systems its Greenville, South Carolina plant manufactures each year. The plant is supposed to have the capacity to produce 400 buses annually, when fully operational.

Proterra’s brands currently include the EcoRide (image, above) bus and FastFill charging station. The company promises that the EcoRide bus can be fully recharged in ten minutes or less on the FastFill charging station. Of the components and content in a Proterra, EcoRide bus, 80 percent are made in the U.S. across 33 states.
Manufacturing industry veteran, David Lehmann, joined Proterra as its new chairman with this deal. Lehman previously worked with General Electric (GE) and Solar Turbines Inc., a subsidiary of Caterpillar. Michael Linse, a partner at KPCB, also joined the board.

Grants $83 Million To Biofuels Startups (Not One Of Them In Silicon Valley),https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/13/doe-biofuels-funding-anti-valley-bias/,2011/06/13," Maybe it’s just a biofuels thing this year, but it seems like the feds are giving cleantech grant money to companies and institutions that are based anywhere but in the nation’s capital of venture capital.
The U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu announced six recipients of $36 million in total grant funding via the Department of Energy’s Biomass Program on Friday. That non-dilutive funding went to organizations working to make the production of “drop-in” biofuels and plant-based chemicals better, and to ultimately bring affordable alternatives to petroleum-based products mainstream in the U.S.
Despite the region’s reputation as a cleantech hotbed, not one Bay Area organization or business scored a piece of this funding. They also missed out on a previous grants round from the same program, announced in May, which doled out $47 million to eight companies in the sector.
The grant receiving companies in Friday’s announcement are from San Diego, Calif., North Carolina, Michigan, Texas and Wisconsin. They included: General Atomics, Genomatica, Michigan Biotechnology Institute, HCL CleanTech, Texas Engineering Experiment Station and Virent.
The organizations in the earlier grant funding announced by the Biomass Program are based in: Florida, Hawaii, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey and South Carolina. They included: the U.S. Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station, the University of Kentucky, University of Kansas Center for Research, University of Florida at Gainesville, Metabolix, Exelus, the Domtar Paper Company, and Cellana.
Where were the Bay Area’s bio-fuels and -chemicals companies, schools and labs? We’re talking to you, L39 in South San Francisco, Solazyme, and Amyris. Maybe they were too busy hiring, and going public to apply for grants from the D.O.E.
A 2010 study of Clean Tech Job Trends by Clean Edge ranked the San Francisco Bay Area number one among major metropolitan areas in the U.S. for cleantech jobs. The study looked at job listings, early stage investment activity, job presence and patent activity.
[Ed’s note: We’ll be watching this space to see if there’s some kind of disadvantage, when it comes to government grant getting, for cleantech companies in and around the Valley.]

706,Household Air Conditioning Unit Doubles As Water Heater,https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/12/air-conditioning-water-heater/,2011/06/12,"Storing heat may be the last thing you think of when turning on an air conditioning unit, but one model takes advantage of the sweltering weather to heat water while cooling the air.
The aptly named Air Conditioner Water Heater, or ACWH, from Hotspot Energy has a condenser unit that sits outside of the building, collecting heat that the air conditioner compresses and expels from inside. The heat passes through a copper heat exchanger that connects to a home or building’s hot water tank. According to the company, the unit can cool a 1000-square-foot room and heat about 100 gallons of water per day. At its peak, the ACWH can provide 18,000 BTU, or 1.5 tons of cooling using 1333 watts per hour.

Heating water while cooling a building can help save energy, since the heat recovery process eases the load of the air conditioner. The unit has to be installed relatively close (ideally within 150 feet of) the water heater, however, and only heats water when the air conditioner is running and there is enough hot air to warm the water. Using the unit on a mild summer day won’t make a significant dent in water heating costs, but it could have an impact for homes with multiple residents who use hot water throughout the day to shower or wash dishes.

HotSpot Energy, which makes the ACWH, sees buildings as large solar thermal collectors, ripe for gathering heat. Although the unit can be installed anywhere, it was designed with the southern U.S. in mind, where many residents use air conditioners during spring and fall, in addition to summer. Commercially, the company envisions restaurant kitchens, laundromats and server rooms benefiting from their technology.

707,"Joulex Raises $17 Million To Cut Energy Costs, Consumption At Large Data Centers",https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/10/joulex-raises-17-million-intel-sigman/,2011/06/10,"JouleX– an Atlanta tech startup promising a way to cut energy consumption and reduce costs at large data centers by about half– closed a $17 million round of financing, the company announced today. Investors included: Sigma Partners, Flybridge Capital Partners and Intel Capital, along with earlier investors Target Partners and TechOperators.
The U.S. EPA has not updated national statistics about how much power data centers are using in the country, in years. However, in 2007 the agency estimated that in a year, the nation’s servers and data centers consumed about 61 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) or 1.5 percent of total U.S. electricity, costing around $4.5 billion for electricity alone. The EPA at that time, predicted national energy consumption by servers and data centers would double by 2011 to more than 100 billion kWh, representing a $7.4 billion annual electricity cost.
A recent survey by The Uptime Institute found 36 percent of data center operators and owners believe they’ll run out of space to add the power and cooling systems they need in their facilities by the end of 2012.
It’s not really a surprise that IT infrastructure is pushed to the limit, and energy consumption by data centers is on the rise, now. In general, businesses are relying more heavily on IT for operations, telecommuting and the like, and consumers’ appetite for features that require greater bandwidth and storage capacity — like mobile video, real-time data access and personal data storage in the cloud— is on the rise.
According to the JouleX’s website, its JEM for Data Centers product:
“…Measur[es] dynamic energy consumption and utilization of any device attached to the network, and supports devices such as physical and virtual servers, core routers and switches, storage, power distribution units (PDUs) and others.”

Joulex faces competition from a variety of companies that want to cut energy cost and consumption in large data centers. Some of these — from Calxeda to VMWare — could be competing in the sense that they want a piece of a data center’s budget. However, they could just as likely turn out to be collaborators whose technology works with Joulex solutions. (Calxeda, formerly Smooth-Stone, shares some investors with Joulex.)
[Ed’s note: Edited the passage above at 11:55 ET after initial publication to reflect Joulex’s potential to collaborate with other players in this space, while competing for a piece of data center budgets.]

708,Google HQ Now Equipped With Coulomb Electric Vehicle Charging Stations,https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/09/google-gets-ev-stations-from-coulomb/,2011/06/09," At its worldwide headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. today Google installed 71 electric vehicle charging stations made by Coulomb Technologies. They will be used to power up employee-owned hybrid and electric vehicles (EVs) as well as the company’s GFleet vehicles.
GFleet is Google’s car sharing program for employees. So far, it includes Chevrolet Volts and Nissan LEAFs.
Google plans to install 250 more charging stations on its campus, according to a press statement from Coulomb today. Its goal is to make 5 percent of Google campus parking EV-ready. The project represents the largest workplace charging installation for electric vehicles in the country, Coulomb and Google claim. The chargers will be managed by Coulomb via their ChargePoint Network.
According to a new blog post by Rolf Schreiber, Google’s Technical Program Manager of Electric Transportation: Google will be adding EV models to its GFleet from other manufacturers as they become available; and between the company’s Gfleet and its biodiesel employee shuttles, the company saves more than 5,400 tonnes of CO2, net annually. That’s compared to an equivalent of typical, single drivers of traditional, combustion engine vehicles. Google estimates it’s “like taking over 2,000 cars off the road, or avoiding 14 million vehicle miles every year.
[Ed’s note: What’s next, Mr. Schreiber? How’s about solar canopies over the parking lots to generate power for the chargers?]

Avantium produces “chemical building blocks” that industrial plastics, textile and fuel makers need to churn out green products that are as affordable and work as well as petroleum-based equivalents.
Avantium uses a catalytic process to convert carbohydrates into furanics, which are bio-materials that can be made from sugar or non-food sources.
The company plans to use its new funds, in part, to create a 100 percent plant-based, 100 percent recyclable polyester. It also aims to complete and begin operating a production plant in Geleen, the Netherlands. The plant was expected to be up and running already, according to earlier reports by Green Car Congress.
The EUR 30 million included EUR 25 million in financing from: Sofinnova Partners, Aster Capital and De Hoge Dennen as well as existing investors Aescap Venture, Capricorn Cleantech Fund, ING Corporate Investments and Navitas Capital. The company also obtained a subsidy and innovation credit of EUR 5 million from the Dutch Ministry of Economy, Agriculture and Innovation. Part of the overall round was used to buy out shares held by DFJ Esprit, AlpInvest, Eastman, EDBI and Pfizer.

710,"Google Earth, Columbia University Map Seafloor Area Bigger Than North America",https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/09/goog-earth-mapping-ocean-floor/,2011/06/09,"
Thursday marked World Oceans Day, a United Nations effort to “raise global awareness of the challenges faced by the international community in connection with the oceans.”
Getting in the spirit, Google Earth and about a dozen research labs paired their data, talents and technology to create high res maps of seafloor terrain. Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory led the charge contributing its Global Multi-Resolution Topography (GMRT) Synthesis and some 20 years worth of data from 500 ship cruises.
The interactive topo maps they created portray an underwater area bigger than North America. Such visualizations help scientists understand natural and man-made disasters including: tsunami events and runups, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, changes in coastal and deep-ocean sea levels, storm surges and contaminant dispersal, according to the website of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a research participant in this project.
A post on The Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory website explained, from what’s already mapped:

“…Scientists have learned much. For instance, researchers can see details of earthquake faults and underwater landslides. Shifts in the seafloor can trigger tsunamis, as shown by this year’s disaster in Japan, and the 2004 wave that swept Sumatra. The sharper imagery helps scientists assess the risk in various regions, including along the U.S.-Canada west coast. The maps also bring erupting mid-ocean ridges into sharper focus and help scientists understand volcanic eruptions on earth, the vast majority of which occur hidden far from view on the ocean floor.”
Other research entities that contributed to the World Oceans Day 2011 seafloor mapping effort with Google Earth include: the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of Hawaii, University of New Hampshire, University of Washington, the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Navy, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of Kiel and the Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service of the Chilean Navy.
Even though this group just collectively doubled what had been mapped before, Google estimates that only 5 percent of the world’s ocean floors have been mapped to date. So. There’s far more eye candy to be had! [hat tip: Julia Whitty at Motherjones].

While he’s no Steve Jobs, Cupertino Mayor Gilbert Wong has his unique charm. In a press conference today responding to yesterday’s amazing Steve Jobs pitch, Wong said emphatically, “Cupertino is ready for this” referring to the 150 acre “Mothership” Apple campus.
Jobs hopes the fantastic building will be ready to house over 12K employees by 2015 (if everything goes as planned).
“There is no chance that we’re saying no,” insisted Wong, who started his life with Apple IIs and Apple II +s, “The Mothership has landed in Cupertino.”
In his statement Wong referred to the fact that his daughter attends the same middle school as Jobs did as a boy, but insisted that no preferential treatment was given to Apple in this decision, “Every time that we have a large company [which] has a large sales tax produced we are very accommodating to that company.”
Wow, an unabashed “Yes,” and Jobs didn’t even have to include free Wifi! But seriously, how would you react?

712,The i3 Platform: A (Paid) Crunchbase For Green Startups?,https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/08/cleantechgroup-i3-launch/,2011/06/08," A research firm focused on clean energy and green innovation, the Cleantech Group, launched its i3 Platform today— and it’s something like a paid Crunchbase, with a dash of Alltop and Gartner, for green tech ventures.
The product became privately available to some of Cleantech Group’s clients in late May. Now, some of the i3 Platform is available for free public use via Research.cleantech.com. Free users get basic search and brief— as in one sentence— company profiles.
Paid subscribers to i3, however, get access to detailed company profiles, complete search results, market mapping tools (see: image below) regular Industry Insights and quarterly investment reports from the Cleantech Group.

The product is meant to help the firm’s clients see how green tech players are connecting, and what relationships have led to the successful commercialization of energy, and environmental problem-solving technologies.
The i3 Platform is populated with Cleantech Group’s new and archived research about: investments, acquisitions, companies and their inter-connectedness in the cleantech space. Cleantech Group also invites entrepreneurs to submit to or update their company profiles within the i3 system.
Any user-submitted content that it publishes via i3 will be verified and edited by Cleantech Group analysts, said the firm’s chief executive officer Sheeraz Haji. He calls this not user-generated, but “structured contributed content.”
On its submissions page, i3 requires users to disclose whether or not they are seeking funding, currently. Could the i3 Platform become a kind of specialized AngelList? Haji said it’s not in the cards:
“We have always connected fund seekers with prospective investors by providing good visibility, and information across the board. Our customers can log in and search for which companies in the system are raising capital, maybe in this state or that region, or in these sectors or subsectors of cleantech. We’re not building that to take a piece of equity or to get a transaction fee, though.”

713,Multiplayer Facebook Game Trash Tycoon Trains You To Be Green (But In A Fun Way),https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/08/multiplayer-facebook-game-trash-tycoon-trains-you-to-be-green-but-in-a-fun-way/,2011/06/08,"Guerillapps, a social game maker, debuted a cool new Facebook game at Disrupt NYC that is adding a new spin to green games. What’s more, from what I can tell, Trash Tycoon is the first “upcycling” game to hit the Facebook platform. But what is this “upcycling”, you ask? Upcycling is the process of converting waste materials into new products of better quality and higher environmental value, so when gamers play Trash Tycoon, they take on the role of recycling entrepreneurs responsible for doing just that.
Gamers become the stewards of their city, a la Sim City, fighting litter and trash wherever it rears its ugly head. Players earn game money and points by collecting trash and upcycling it to create new products out of trash, just like its sponsor TerraCycle does in the real, green world.
Guerillapps, which recently received a $500K in seed funding from Rhodium, will be keeping Trash Tycoon in private beta until later this month, but TechCrunch readers can get an early taste of the game here.
One of the many cool parts about Trash Tycoon is that it’s trying to separate its game from the traditional Facebook social game model by adding synchronous play, offering realtime multiplayer, so that users can communicate and collaborate in realtime during play, banding together with friends to attack their city’s trash heaps.
Trash Tycoon is also putting an interesting spin on its revenue model, offering seamless inclusion for green brands right in the gameplay. This may sound slightly off-putting, after all, who wants to play a game with brand logos stamped on every object? But Trash Tycoon’s brand integration isn’t offensive: The energy items players need to collect may be branded products, as will the factories players build to recycle waste. But these brand tie-ins have real world justification. The piece of gum you collect might be Wrigley’s, and so on.
“We integrate the same real world dynamics of TerraCycle brands in the game in attempt to avoid things like banners, or in-your-face branded items, for example”, said Guerillapps Co-founder and CEO Raviv Turner.
And the great thing about Trash Tycoon’s brand integration is that it’s enabled by TerraCycle’s business model. Just as TerraCycle works with major partners to run packaging reclamation programs, which pay schools and other community groups to collect the sponsors’ packaging to later be upcycled into items that bear the sponsor’s brand, this process is mirrored in Trash Tycoon. The company is also able to leverage the existing user bases of its partners, like the 24 million at TerraCycle, which significantly helps write off user acquisition cost. It’s a ready-made user base.
For Guerillapps, it’s not just about offering a game-ified product or game-ified approach to green behavior and upcycling, it’s about creating a playable social game that incorporates reality into the virtual world. Waste Management built a Facebook game to teach users how to use its interactive recycling kiosks last year, but the game still hasn’t taken off (only 6,400 montly active users), and Guerillapps hopes that by incorporating brands and real world concepts like recycling and upcycling organically into the game, as opposed to a game-ified, education-entertainment gameplay experience, the player will learn but do so with greater enjoyment.
To build a more playable game, Guerillapps brought on two veteran game designers Greg Costikyan and Naomi Clark (who has consulted and developed concepts for clients and publishers including PBS, Disney, Fisher Price, Wizards of the Coast, Electronic Arts, Nintendo, Major League Baseball), who are both responsible for Trash Tycoon’s addictive design and gameplay. The veteran designers goes towards alleviating any concern that this is just another Facebook game ported from another medium or whipped off in 24 hours.
Trash Tycoon has partnered with Treehugger.com and also donates 10 percent of revenues from its virtual currency to CarbonFund.org and plans to later introduce a “Play to Offset” icon, so that if you, say, order an Amtrak train ticket, or buy a flight ticket online, CarbonFund partners will present the “Play to Offset” icon so users can go play Trash Tycoon and offset their carbon footprint, instead of just paying with a credit card.
Turner says that that Guerillapps next steps involve taking the Trash Tycoon model to other verticals, like energy, health care, parenting, and more. The company isn’t looking to be the next CityVille, he says, the team wants to design games around affinity groups, which offer a more active and social (and socially active) community of users looking to learn and have fun while doing it. The startup is also currently in the process of raising its second round.

More and more consumers are looking to purchase eco-friendly and natural products in the fashion, beauty, personal care and toys industries. Enter LovingEco, a recently launched flash sales site which is essentially a Gilt Groupe for eco-fashion and natural goods.
LovingEco, which was founded by Justine Lassoff and Melinda Moore, features daily sales on discounted eco-friendly, natural items. For example, one of today’s sales is for organic cotton clothing. Another sale features handbags that are made from inner tubes collected at local truck stops.
Similar to OneKingsLane and Gilt, LovingEco features ‘tastemaker pics,’ where celebrities and environmental experts curate their favorite products from the sales. The site also features a V-Wall for the community to share their donations and eco-friendly content.
And LovingEco takes sales a step further and donates 3 percent of net proceeds from each purchase to a ‘tastemaker charity’ to help support a social or environmental cause.
LovingEco, which faces competition from Pure Citizen and Blissmo, has raised a seed round of funding from angel investors that include Allen Debevoise;  CEO of Machinima; Emily Della Maggiora, VP of comScore Marketing Solutions; Douglas Abel, former VP at Sapient; and Jackie Wilgar, SVP Marketing at Live Nation Entertainment.

716,"Jobs To Cupertino: We Want A Spaceship-Shaped, 12K Capacity Building As Our New Apple Campus",https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/07/steve-jobs-cupertino/,2011/06/07,"


After having a banner WWDC start yesterday, Apple founder and CEO Steve Jobs humbly presented his idea for a new Apple campus at the Cupertino City Council today. Jobs wants to build one building that will hold 12,000 Apple employees on a former Hewlett-Packard property in the area between Tantau North Wolfe, Homestead and the 280 freeway.”It’s a little like a spaceship landed,” Jobs says. No kidding.
Jobs began the presentation referring to the fact that Apple is growing “like a weed,” and that its current campus at D’Anza and the 280 isn’t enough — fitting only about 2,800 people. Apple currently rents buildings to house its other 6,700 employees in the area. The new building will augment the current campus.
Paving the way for these plans, Apple purchased about 100 acres from Hewlett Packard in 2010 and added them to the 50 it owns adjacent. Jobs says he has corralled “some great architects … some of the best in the world” to come up with a design that will house 12,000 people in one four story high building on the property. The area is now mainly apricot orchards.
With the futuristic design Apple apparently is relying heavily on its experience building retail stores, and it will be creating one massive piece of curved glass if the proposal goes through. “There’s not a single straight piece of glass in this building,” Jobs says. The parking will be underground.
Jobs also wants the building to function as its own power source, with an “energy center” as its primary source of power (“with natural gas and other ways that are cleaner and cheaper”), using the grid as a backup.
The campus will include amenities like its own auditorium similar to Apple’s current Town Hall (“We’ve got an auditorium, cause we put on presentations, much like we did yesterday but we have to go to San Francisco to do them.”) and a cafeteria that will feed 3,000 people at one sitting.
“We do have a shot at building the best office building in the world,” Jobs told the Council members, “Architecture students will come here to see this.” Ideally Apple wants to move into the campus in 2015.
The individual members of the Cupertino City Council seemed like they were in awe the entire time the infamously charismatic Apple CEO spoke (which isn’t surprising), asking Jobs for free Wifi and iPads for constituents as well as for an Apple store that’s actually in Cupertino and not in the Valley or Los Gatos. Jobs shyly responded to the requests, “I think we bring a lot more than free Wifi.”
Key facts about the new Apple campus:

Design will include a courtyard in the middle and curved glass all the way around.
Jobs is planning on transforming an area that’s 20% landscaping to 80% landscaping by putting most of the building’s parking underground.
There are 3,700 trees in the area at the moment, Jobs has hired an arborist from Stanford to take the area up to 6,000 trees.
The plan is to build a four-story high building and four-story parking structure.
The campus will incude an energy center, and natural gas will be the primary source of power, using the grid as backup.
There will be an auditorium, fitness center and some R & D buildings.
Jobs plans a 40% increase in Apple employees going from 9,500 today to 13, 000 in 2015.
He wants to increase the campus’ space 20% from 2.6 million to 3.1 million square feet.
Landscaping will increase 60% from 3,700 to 6,000.
Surface parking will decrease 90% from 9,800 to 1,200 .
The building footprint will decrease 30% from 1.4 million to 1 million.
Cafeterias will fit 3,000 people at a sitting.
The whole building will be designed with the utmost concern for employee safety.
Apple currently has 20 buses running on bio-diesel fuel for its employees and Jobs thinks that system will work well with the new campus.
The plan for the new design will submitted asap. Jobs hopes to break ground next year and eventually move in 2015.

Update: Cupertino Mayor Gilbert Wong says “there’s no chance” they’re going to say no to this thing. Mission accomplished.

The round was joined by undisclosed angels and one chip manufacturer, reports managing director of the Ho Chi Minh City-based venture fund, Phuc Tan.
Greenvity’s chips could be used in everything from energy meters, home appliances, electric vehicles and solar inverters to mobile phones and routers, Tan confirmed.
In an e-mail interview with TechCrunch, the investor also explained:
“[Today] only a small number of devices and appliances in the home incorporate energy saving features, partly because of cost…and the lack of a robust enabling technology. Greenvity’s [chip technology] paves the way for a larger number [of these] to have smart, energy saving features.”

Greenvity plans to generate revenue by selling chips to manufacturers, but hasn’t ruled out the possibility of licensing its technology. So far, the startup— which has significant operations in Vietnam— is working with prospective customers that manufacture: home appliances, smart meters and set top boxes, so far. Its customer list is confidential due to non-disclosure agreements, however.
Designed to work with a range of CPUs including: the X86 Intel embedded CPU, Atom CPU, ARM CPU, and custom embedded CPUs, Greenvity’s chips will also include encryption and security features. That could make Greenvity’s technology distinct from competitors’ offerings. The “system on a chip” space is crowded. A handful of U.S. based competitors to Greenvity range from: Conexant to Palmchip and Texas Instruments.
Greenvity will focus on markets in countries where smart grid infrastructure is taking off, affordable smart devices are in demand, and energy costs or consumption are on the rise. Its sales efforts in the near term will be throughout the U.S., Europe, China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan, Tan confirmed.

719,Could This Be The First Solar Powered Laptop?,https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/04/first-solar-powered-laptop/,2011/06/04,"
While there are plenty of solar-powered peripherals that plug into your laptop to boost its battery power, we haven’t yet seen a model that runs solely on solar. Industrial Designer Andrea Ponti‘s concept for the Luce Solar Panel Powered PC could become the greenest laptop ever made.

The computer has two solar panels: One on the back of the monitor and one underneath a touch keyboard. Ideally, the two panels would be able to power the computer continuously, though it’s unclear whether this has been successfully tested. Using a laptop in the sun is far more battery intensive than indoors since the screen brightness needs to be cranked up to compete with the sun’s bright light.

One solution could be to use an electronic ink display in place of the usual backlit flat panel. Although the laptop includes a battery, the cordless design means your productivity will plummet in the evening — at least until you reach for another digital device.
The Luce, which means light in Italian, is made from a clear polycarbonate and weighs about four pounds. It was shortlisted in Fujitsu’s 2011 design competition.

There’s no word on whether Fujitsu plans to turn Ponti’s design into reality, but either way they’re not the only ones thinking about integrating sunlight into computer design. Last year Apple filed a patent for “harnessing external light to illuminate a display screen.”

In Apple’s vision, a reflector could fold down to brighten the display, and the company is rumored to be looking at integrating solar cells as well.

CEA also estimated that just 10.2 million U.S. households are enrolled in electricity management programs, now. That’s a mere 8.6 percent of 119 million households that have access to these things.
Overall, energy management programs help consumers control most anything that’s plugged in at home — from heaters and air conditioners to dishwashers and lighting — so that the devices keep them comfortable and happy without hogging as much power. One aim of these programs would be to decrease pollution caused by large-scale electricity generation. Another aim is to keep the cost of electricity reasonable as demand rises.
A number of software and hardware startups— like eMeter, Grid2Home, OPOWER and Green Energy Options—  are working with huge power companies to make these programs, and devices and software to support them, mainstream.
It’s hard to see how the U.S. will achieve national goals to reduce energy related pollution and emissions, when not even 10 percent of the American adults who have access to energy management programs try them out.
Some of the harmful environmental impacts of traditional electricity generation are acid rain and air pollution. The Federal Government aims to reduce its own greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 28 percent by 2020; and the EPA has proposed new national standards for mercury, arsenic and other toxic air pollution from power plants.
However, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) page projects energy demand in the U.S. will rise by 1% a year through 2035.
The growth in demand and consumption of electricity has, in recent years, led to growth in pollution globally. The International Energy Agency reported last week that global emissions of energy-related carbon dioxide in 2010 were the highest ever measured at 30.6 gigatonnes.
Attitudes aren’t all bad stateside, though. The CEA survey found 55 percent of U.S. consumers are at least interested in an electricity management program that’s sponsored by their local utility or electric company. Forty-six percent of those who are aware of electricity management programs say they want to enroll in coming years.

721,Tesla Taps Public Markets Again; Raises Over $200M To Develop Model X Vehicle,https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/03/tesla-taps-public-markets-again-raises-over-200m-to-develop-model-x-vehicle/,2011/06/03,"Electric car company Tesla Motors has priced its follow-on offering of 5,300,000 shares of stock at $28.76 per share, the closing price for Tesla shares on June 2. Tesla CEO Elon Musk also plans to purchase 1,416,000 shares of stock directly from Tesla at the public offering price and Blackstar Investco, an affiliate of Daimler AG (a Tesla investor), plans to purchase up to 637,475 shares of stock directly from Tesla at the public offering price. Tesla has also granted the underwriter a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 795,000 shares of stock. Excluding the underwriter option, Tesla will raise around $211 million in this follow-on offering.
This money is primarily going towards the development of its Model X crossover vehicle, says Tesla The Model X will be Tesla’s first SUV, and will cost around $30,000. Musk has said that this car, which is expected to become available in 2013, will be appeal to mainstream car buyers because of its lower price point.
Currently Tesla offers a sports car, the Roadster, and in 2012 its sedan vehicle, the Model S, will go on sale to the public.
Tesla shares started trading on the NASDAQ last June at around $19 per share. Shares over the past year have performed moderately well of late—the high has been around $36.42 and currently Tesla is trading at $28.76.
While secondary offerings take place often with public companies, there are a few questions that are raised with this offering. First, will Tesla tap the public markets every time they want to develop a new vehicle? Second, Musk continues to bankroll Tesla. Through the private placement, he’s putting nearly $41 million towards the development of the Model X.

722,"New Records In Cleantech Offer Hope For More Affordable Solar Power, LED Lights",https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/02/record-setters-solar-and-led/,2011/06/02," Cleantech companies— especially in solar— love to talk about how they’re breaking records. They issue press releases left and right about the most efficient this, that and the other. Such claims fizzle if they haven’t been verified by a third-party lab. They can also feel like greenwash, or Cola War style brand standoffs.
Broken records we love to hear about, though, are like these from cleantech ventures Lighting Science Group and Flisom (in Switzerland). Here’s what they’ve done and why it matters…
1. One Million LED Bulbs Made In One Quarter
On May 31, Lighting Science Group — makers of light emitting diode (LED) bulbs that are Energy Star rated — reported that during the first quarter of 2011, they produced and sold 1 million bulbs. In 2010, Lighting Science produced and sold 1 million bulbs in the second half of the year, according to company statements.
Bulk production and sales increases like this suggest that LED lights, which are more energy-efficient and durable than flourescent and incandescent bulbs, are becoming mainstream and more affordable.
2. Flexible Solar Technology Reaches 18.7 Percent Efficiency
Flexible, thin-film solar cells can now deliver more electricity per square inch than ever before.
Scientists from EMPA, Switzerland’s Federal Laboratory for Materials Science and Innovation, along with a Swiss startup called Flisom broke the energy conversion efficiency record for flexible thin-film CIGS solar cells, last week. They hit 18.7 percent efficiency for their CIGS (copper indium gallium selenide) flexible solar cells.
A previous record of 15.7 percent was announced by MiaSole in December 2010 (as TechCrunch reported then).
The new record means that electricity generated by thin-film solar will become more affordable, hopefully alleviating reliance on petroleum and coal for power somewhat.
The improved efficiency also means that the flexible, lighter-weight solar panels could catch up to rigid, silicon solar panels in terms of performance which would allow more consumer choice and competition in solar.

723,Recargo App Helps Electric Vehicle Drivers Find And Review Charging Stations,https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/01/recargo-app-for-ev-drivers/,2011/06/01," Another app to help electric vehicle (EV) drivers find a place to power up? Yep. This one, Recargo, was made by the founder of Dictionary.com, Brian Kariger, and launched stealthily in July last 2010. So far, the app has attracted hundreds of users, Kariger told TechCrunch. The company added new features and is pushing for wider adoption today, with a version 1.5 release.
New features on Recargo include: Yelp-like, user contributed reviews and photos of charging stations that EV drivers encounter and use, and news content about clean transportation syndicated in-app from Recargo’s partner, PlugInCars.com.

Recargo, currently available for iOS only, generates revenue through in-app advertisements, and shares revenue with PlugInCars.com.
Here’s why user-generated, and real-time updated reviews and photos of EV charging stations should prove useful to EV drivers, Kariger said:

“I took a trip to Ventura up from L.A. and I drove to where there was supposed to be a charging station. Nobody on the lot had used it, though. Not knowing where it was, and driving anxiously around this lot was just frustrating. Having an image of the charging station in context, or some directions from another driver that used it would have been helpful.
You don’t want to start driving hundreds of miles away from home and not know you’ll be able to go somewhere to charge before reaching your final destination. We use crowd sourced reviews and data from open APIs to let drivers know about things like this.”


Recargo is distinct from others in the field, like PlugShare by Xatori, in part because it is generating revenue already.
Some of Recargo’s earliest users have been in Hong Kong and Germany, according to Kariger. The serial entrepreneur is the proud owner and driver of different alternative vehicles, including: a Tesla Roadster, a Nissan Leaf and a Volkswagen Touareg that uses biodiesel.
Down the line, Recargo aims to become a mobile app development studio whose products help the makers and drivers of electric vehicles, worldwide. Near-term Kariger hopes to get an Android app out, and to add traffic data to Recargo, to let driver plan their commutes more energy-efficiently.

724,SolarCity Can Now Finance $1 Billion In Solar Projects,https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/01/solarcity-financing-funds-1bil/,2011/06/01," On Wednesday, SolarCity added $158 million to the pool of funds that it uses to finance, design, develop and install commercial or residential solar power projects in the U.S. The latest fund came through a partnership with U.S. Bancorp (a subsidiary of U.S. Bank) and gives SolarCity more than $1 billion in financing capacity.
According to a SolarCity press statement, the San Mateo cleantech company now boasts: 14 solar project financing funds via six financial partners; 14,000 solar customers; and 24 centers of operation in 11 states and more than 1,000 employees.
In February, SolarCity acquired two solar installers with an established market on the East Coast — a division of groSolar and the solar division of Clean Currents — to expand its business well beyond the sun belt. The company plans to use its newly established fund to finance its SolarLease and power purchase agreement offerings.
SolarCity’s nearest competitor, SunRun, also offers financing help to prospective customers, enabled via partnerships with banks and energy companies. About a month ago, SunRun closed a $200 million fund for solar project financing via U.S. Bancorp. Overall, SunRun boasts $600 million in financing capacity, compared to SolarCity’s $1 billion.

725,"Algae Biofuels Maker Solazyme Goes Public, Finally, Raking In $197.6 Million",https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/27/solazyme-ipo-nasdaq-szym/,2011/05/27,"  Shares in Solazyme, the makers of algae biofuels and algae-based oils and chemicals used in health and beauty products, began trading on Nasdaq under the symbol SZYM.O on Friday. The business set an initial public offering price at $18, but its stock opened at $20 and traded between $19.60 and $22.00 throughout the day, with 10.98 million shares sold, raising about $197.6 million for the company.
Solazyme’s S-1 filing on March 11, 2011 confirmed its intention to go public, officially. Speculation about an IPO for the company preceded that by many months in the cleantech industry, however.
Algae-derived marine and jet fuels made by Solazyme have been used and tested by the U.S. Navy. Prior to going public, the company also sold dietary supplements and skin care products, made from algae-based oils, via retailers including: Whole Foods, GNC, Sephora and QVC. It also struck deals to expand production and sell its fuels and oils to Chevron, Dow Chemical, Unilever, and Qantas Airlines Ltd.
Founded in 2003, and headquartered in South San Francisco, Solazyme’s venture investors include: the Roda Group, Braemar Energy Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Sir Richard Branson, a well-known advocate for the use of renewable fuels.
Competitors to Solazyme include biofuels makers like Gevo and Amyris, also public companies, that convert plant-based sugars — from sugarcane and other starchy crops, rather than algae — into fuel and oils that can displace petroleum-based products.
Other privately held cleantech startups in the algae biofuels space could prove significant competition. One interesting player, LiveFuels, is a next-generation fishery and biofuels maker, that uses living fish to process all forms of algae, and then presses the oil out of the fish before selling the edible fillets. LiveFuels’ business would avoid the cost of phosphorous — which is used in food farming, and is in shorter and shorter supply these days, globally — through its unique methods; but the company has not scaled up to commercial sales of biofuels and fish, yet.
Several others that have already begun to produce and sell biofuels from a variety of feedstocks — including food waste, jatropha, sugarcane and algae — have struck huge partnerships with, or drawn venture investments from traditional oil and gas companies, already.
A few examples: earlier this month, BP Alternative Energy Ventures led an investment round of $9.4 million (out of a targeted $15 million) in Verdezyne, a startup using yeast to produce biofuels and chemicals; in June 2010, Cargill and Shell led a $46.4 million investment in Madison, Wisconsin-based Virent Energy Systems, the makers of biogasoline; and Synthetic Genomics, which is genetically engineering algae for biofuels, attracted a $600 million research and development deal from Exxon in 2009.
On May 24, the U.S. federal government announced plans to “Contribute to meeting national goals of reducing oil imports by one-third by 2025 and putting one million advanced vehicles on the road by 2015,” by making all of its new, light duty vehicles — leased or purchased by agencies — “alternative fueled vehicles” by the end of 2015. That government definition includes hybrid or electric, compressed natural gas, or biofuel vehicles — that’s good news for Solazyme, and its competitors.

726,Accoya Uses Chemistry Trick To Detoxify Exterior Wood Treatment Process,https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/27/accoya-uses-chemistry-trick-to-detoxify-exterior-wood-treatment-process/,2011/05/27,"
Most options for wood used in decks, outdoor furniture and siding are rarely entirely earth friendly, since they are often treated with heavy metals or toxic chemicals, or logged from unsustainable forests. One company is innovating in the space by altering the chemistry of the wood itself to make it weather and decay resistant.
After several years of research and development, Accsys Technologies began producing Accoya, a treated wood designed for outdoor exposure. The process uses acetylization, a chemical reaction that bonds together the hydroxyl group of molecules in the wood  and replaces them with an acetyl group of molecules. The hydroxyl group is what microorganisms feed on, a cause of rot and decay, says Lisa Ayala, who represents Accsys’ North American branch. It is also what causes wood to shrink and swell.
To perform the molecular swap, wood goes through a vessel where heat, time and the addition of acetic anhydride creates a byproduct called acetic acid. In its simplest form, acetic acid dilutes to vinegar.

“When people smell the wood, they say it smells like pickles,” Ayala said. Less than 1% of the acetic acid remains in the wood after treatment, though even this small amount can cause zinc-plated or galvanized steel fasteners to corrode. The company offers recommendations on what kinds of fasteners and glues have been successfully tested with the treated wood.
Accoya could be used in place of pressure-treated wood, although Ayala said the company sees itself as more competitive with tropical hardwoods such as teak and ipe. According to the company, Accoya wood requires less maintenance than its tropical counterparts, and comes with a 50-year warranty for wood used above ground.

Currently, the company only sells products made from Radiata Pine, though it is exploring other species. The Netherlands-based factory hopes to expand production into other countries, where it can offer wood made from trees native to each area.
Accoya sells its products through distributors in 25 countries.  The wood is generally more expensive than something like red oak, but is as much as half the price of teak or ipe, said Royal Plywood Company Materials Consultant Bruce Halvarson.
“No natural moisture can penetrate that wood,” Halvarson said. “If you try and put a water based stain on it, it won’t take at all, but an oil based stain will wick all the way through the wood from one side to the other.” Since the wood is treated from the inside out, it can be cut and modified in a variety of ways without compromising protection.
Accys was awarded a Cradle to Cradle Gold Certification by MBDC for its sustainable products and manufacturing processes.

727,"EcoMotors Chief Don Runkle: ""Electric Vehicles Are Not 'Zero Emissions'""",https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/26/disrupt-transportation-brammo-ecomotors/,2011/05/26,"
 



The chief executive officers of two very different clean tech startups, Brammo and EcoMotors, discussed the relative merits and limitations of clean vehicle technology at TechCrunch Disrupt in New York on Wednesday.
Oregon-based Brammo designs and manufactures all-electric motorcycles and the battery technology and software that powers them, while Michigan-based EcoMotors designs and makes more efficient combustion engines.
EcoMotors’ CEO Don Runkle roundly criticized clean tech advocates who say all-electric vehicles (EVs) are “zero emissions.” Causing a bit of a stir in the conference hall, Runkle, the former VP of engineering at GM, went on to claim that EcoMotors’ engine technology enables car companies to produce diesel-powered vehicles that have a lower, overall carbon footprint than any electric automobile available today.
Given that electric vehicles don’t produce diesel exhaust, and don’t use fossil fuels, how can this be? Runkle explained: more than 50 percent of the world’s power is generated by the burning of coal, today, and that had to factor into the “carbon footprint” assessment of all-electric vehicles.
Brammo CEO Craig Bramscher said that he refrains from calling his company’s plug-in, electric motorcycles — including the Enertia, Empulse, Engage and Encite (some models have yet to hit the road) – “zero emissions vehicles.”
During a live broadcast backstage following the session, Bramscher noted that power generation is changing, and coal will become a smaller piece of the overall energy equation over time. He also said, “The argument you have to burn coal to generate electricity is true but [electric vehicles] still 92 percent more efficient [than combustion]…”
On the main stage, Bramscher said that personally, he didn’t want his children fighting to defend an oil field as petroleum resources become strained. He would be much happier when they grow up if they could find work designing or making batteries, instead.

730,BioPro Takes DIY Approach To Biofuels,https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/21/biopro-makes-biofuels-diy/,2011/05/21,"
Passionate biodiesel hobbyists have long relied on their local diner’s supply of used cooking oil to power their cars, but a unit that automatically converts oil to fuel could help restaurants do it themselves.
The BioPro 190, made by Springboard, is a tall stainless steel box containing a biodiesel processor that that mixes, heats and separates used cooking oil, producing ready-to-pump biodiesel in about 48 hours. Both animal and vegetable oils can be used, and though the oil requires the addition of methanol, sulphuric acid and a catalyst to be processed, these are the only steps in the recipe to to fueling any diesel-run vehicle. While vehicles typically require biodiesel conversion to run on on biofuels, Springboard claims their fuel can power any diesel engine without being converted.
This could be a big step forward for biodiesel which is often inconsistent in quality when manually produced. It could also provide a new revenue stream for the restaurant industry.
BioPro 190 units sell for $9,995, but buyers will have to find suppliers for the sulfuric acid, methanol and catalyst to mix with their cooking oil on their own. A smaller BioPro 150 model sells for $5995, with an additional charge for a fuel pump.

731,"Toshiba To Acquire Smart Grid Tech Firm, Landis+Gyr, For $2.3 Billion",https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/19/toshiba-acquires-landis-gyr/,2011/05/19," Toshiba — the diversified tech company best known for its consumer electronics, lighting and HVAC systems — is coming after the smart grid market in Europe and the U.S. with the acquisition of a Swiss smart grid tech firm, Landis+Gyr. Toshiba announced a commitment to acquire Landis+Gyr for $2.3 billion today.
The company makes power distribution, metering and smart home software and systems, which will supplement Toshiba’s utility-related offerings and give Toshiba reach into new markets in Europe, the U.S., China, India and Brazil, where Landis+Gyr has already gained some traction, according to a company statement (link, above).
While Toshiba sells hardware used by utilities — in substations, on poles and transmission lines, for example — this is their first major move to grab a piece of the energy management business on the metering and consumer side.
Toshiba’s acquisition of Landis+Gyr could impact the likelihood, or pricing of an initial public offering by Silver Spring Networks, the smart grid company backed by Google Ventures, Foundation Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Northgate Capital.
Silver Spring Networks closed a round of financing in December 2010, which brought its total capital raised to about $250 million. It also prepared to go public last year, at one point hiring Morgan Stanley and Jeffries & Co. to do so, with an alleged goal for a $3 billion valuation reported Fortune’s Dan Primack, then.
Silver Spring Networks already counts large North American utilities like Florida Power & Light, and Pacific Gas & Electric among its customers. The company did not respond to a request for comment on its IPO plans or the impact of the Toshiba deal to the industry in time for publication.
Reuters reported that Bill Maris of Google Ventures at a venture capital conference in New York today, said that Silver Spring Networks’ revenue is growing rapidly.

Bob Gohn, research director for the Smart Grid sector at Pike Research, told TechCrunch:


“Landis+Gyr itself once planned an IPO. We’re not certain why the business took the private sale route. It’s not clear how this could impact Silver Spring Networks’ IPO plan.
It seems that Silver Spring Networks may have had expectations of a valuation that would be pretty high relative to their global reach, and breadth of products. One challenge in this market — there are a lot of big, smart grid investments to be made — is that growth is likely to happen in waves, by region.
Pike forecasts growth in North America reaching $1.7 billion for smart meter, hardware related revenue by the end of 2012, then declining in the region followed by growth in Europe, then Asia.
It will be interesting to see what Toshiba can do for Landis+Gyr in Asia, or vice versa. The big prize of the market in China remains relatively closed. Smart metering vendors from outside of China itself don’t see a lot of business there. But the 15 to 20 smart metering companies that manufacture there, do.”

Smart grid companies that have exited through successful M&As, of late — including Mincom which was acquired by ABB this month, or Opal Software which was acquired back in October 2010 by GE Energy — have been involved in operating software, and back-end, IT management more than metering for the consumer, like that provided by Tendril or EnergyHub, or on metering in general.
Gohn predicts better exits in the smart grid sector for software and services startups serving the U.S. market, rather than hardware and metering, in the near future.

Venture capital firm Khosla Ventures is raising $1 billion for its new fund, Khosla Ventures IV, an SEC filing reveals. From the looks of it, the new fund will be roughly the same size as the previous one (raised in September 2009).
The news comes a few weeks after former YouTube and Facebook CFO Gideon Yu left the firm after joining them less than two years earlier, to go work for the San Francisco 49ers.
The Menlo Park, California-based investment firm was founded in 2004 by Vinod Khosla, the iconic co-founder of Sun Microsystems and former general partner of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and focuses on investments in early stage companies in the Internet, computing, mobile, silicon technology and cleantech industries.
Portfolio companies include Square, Jawbone, BOKU, Hunch, GroupMe, Meebo and Xobni.
I’ve contacted Khosla Ventures for more information, but haven’t heard back yet.
In the meantime, here’s an awesome piece of text from their website, which you may find inspirational:

Change depends on unreasonable people. Don’t assume–analyze. Brutal honesty trumps hypocritical politeness. Have courage. Build companies instead of cutting deals.
Thrive on technological risk. Ignore the nonsense of conventional wisdom. People matter. Care about genuine issues: a healthy environment. Sustainable power. Free information. Go for GREAT, not just good. Be willing to fail but aim for revolutionary success.

733,"WaterSmart Raises $900,000 To Help Utilities Promote Efficiency",https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/18/watersmart-seed-round/,2011/05/18,"WaterSmart Software, a green tech startup that’s frequently compared to the energy management startup OPower has closed a $900,000 round of seed financing led by Menlo Incubator and joined by Sand Hill Angels, Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Physic Ventures.
The company’s co-founder Peter Yolles explained the concept of the technology in an interview with TechCrunch ahead of the funding announcement:
“WaterSmart Software is really about creating a relationship between the water utility and the homeowner. Most residential consumers don’t understand how much water they use and where it goes in the home. We’re trying to create a way for them to ask and answer questions like: how do I compare to my neighbors, in terms of water use? What are the two or three best things I can do in or around my own home to save water? What costs me the most money?”

Another WaterSmart Software co-founder, Rob Steiner said:

“We white label our analytics, so they appear online and in print like a tool from the water utility that helps people monitor their water use, break down the meaning of their water bills, and take advantage of all the incentives, rebates and freebies a utility already offers.
We have hundreds of parameters and variables that we analyze, including: water consumption and water billing, census, demographic, real estate, climate and weather information. We even include some details that are about how much you can cut down on gas and electricity use, when you cut down on things like hot water.
We’re making it easier for consumers to save money, and making it easier for utilities to market water and energy efficiency better.”

WaterSmart’s executives found — through a combination of the company’s own research and outside market intelligence — that a typical household of 4 people including children in the U.S. will use between eight and ten thousand gallons of water per billing month, and that in most U.S. markets, the price of water is going up 1.5 times faster than any other utility bills each year. They believe they can help utilities and consumers reduce water consumption by 2 percent, this year.
Does that amount to significant savings on a dollar basis? In some markets more than others, perhaps.
According to Circle of Blue: “In the last year, the price of water in 30 U.S. metropolitan areas has increased an average of 9.4 percent for residential customers with medium consumption levels… Yet the median increase for medium consumption was 8.6 percent.”
Steiner said the startup will use its new-found capital to complete pilot projects already under way with major water utilities in California, and to get beyond the proof of concept phase with their technology. They also seek to hire ten people this year; they currently have six full-time employees and are based in San Francisco.
Not affiliated with the WaterSmart Innovations conference, or U.S. Department of Interior program to help states and water companies adhere with the SECURE Water Act — WaterSmart Software won the inaugural, ImagineH2O competition in May 2010. The competition rewards businesses with technology that can curb, and help people cope with a growing, global water crisis.
Scott Bryan, director of operations with ImagineH2O said:
“Natural resources are over drafted, and there’s an increasing risk affiliated with climate change that makes water supplies more variable around the world. Companies like WaterSmart will make it easier for anyone to understand their water footprint. Most importantly, they have hit upon a capital efficient way to make a difference and to raise awareness. Many other water and cleantech ideas require tens of millions of dollars to even try to get something up and running.” 
Serial startup CFO, and angel investor Steve Bennet, with both Menlo Incubator and Sand Hill Angels, said the company locked the substantial seed round because:
“The co-founders are water geeks with a lot of domain expertise. They had already developed a great portal, and analytics. They also managed to sign up two, municipal water providers to homeowners in Northern and Southern California to use their software. Having these pilots lined up made us enthusiastic. Though there are a lot of unknowns, here, the investment will help the company get proof points about how well software, including some game dynamics, can drive efficiency.”

734,One Day Will People Be Living In Shroom Houses?,https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/14/shroom-houses/,2011/05/14,"
Construction material manufacturing often produces hazardous byproducts that are either toxic or difficult to recycle, as are many of the materials themselves. Brooklyn based Planetary ONE is experimenting with the idea of grow-your-own construction materials by making bricks from mushrooms.
Their latest project, Mycoform, places mushroom roots known as mycelium spores into a mold and feeds them with agricultural byproducts like buckwheat husks. In just over a week at 80 degrees, the spores grow to fill the form, resulting in a light yet solid structure. The brick is heated to above 100 (optimally 200) degrees when complete to kill the spores, preventing further growth.
Maria Aiolova, a Planetary ONE team member, said they have been working on the idea of growing building materials for more than a year to develop materials for a variety of uses. In addition to construction materials, Mycoform can be used to make acoustic tiles, insulation, shelters for disaster-stricken areas, and temporary structures such as street fair booths. Another company, Ecovative, uses a simliar process for creating shipping materials.
In their experiments, the Mycofoam team found the edible Reishi mushroom provides consistent results. The finished structure is entirely biodegradable.
Although Mycofoam by itself is sun, mold and water resistant, biodegradability makes it a poor solution for longer-term structures. To address this, the team makes brick molds out of recycled aluminum sheets. When grown inside this aluminum casing, the bricks are expected to last between 25 and 30 years. Each brick can withstand about 2000psi, equivalent to the strength of a regular brick.

As much as half the cost of manufacturing traditional bricks can go to energy for kiln firing and drying. Traditional brick production also produces up to 1.3 pounds of carbon dioxide per unit. Mycoform bricks require very little energy, produce no carbon, and cost as little as a quarter of a penny per unit. The startup cost of Mycoform brick manufacturing include a $150 hydraulic press and $50 steel mold for shaping the aluminum, and a greenhouse structure, which can be made from plastic and wood, for growing the spores.
The team has applied for grants to expand their production capacity and, in the future, hopes to send Mycoform kits to developing countries.

735,"Only YOU, Or A Wireless Network And Sensors, Can Prevent Forest Fires",https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/12/insight-stop-forest-fires-with-sensors/,2011/05/12," Networks and wireless sensors have been used for years — by companies like Lighting Science Group, Arch Rock (acquired by Cisco) and D-Link — in a variety of smart building, smart grid and security applications. Their systems can sense occupancy, control lighting and temperatures, and make energy-sucking devices a little more efficient, or make buildings a little easier to patrol and keep safe.
Now, a startup called Insight Innovation & Technology Ltd. (a.k.a. Insight) is using wireless sensors and networks in the wild to predict, prevent and track forest fires. The company installed its technology in Hong Kong’s Tai Lam Country Park with the cooperation of the Guangdong Forestry Department.
The sensors were placed strategically (image, right) to monitor environmental factors like temperature and humidity throughout the forest. The data they pick up is transmitted in real-time via 4.2Ghz radio frequency communication networks. Insight won two awards today for this project, from a major research park and incubator: the Honk Kong ICT 2011 silver award for the “Best Innovation & Research (Postgraduate & Open),” and a certificate of merit for “Best Social Responsibility.”

736,GridGlo Raises $1.2 Million To Help Utilities Understand How Customers Use Electricity,https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/11/gridglo-seedround-cubrc/,2011/05/11," A New York research firm that turns massive amounts of data into streamlined information, CUBRC (pronounced “coo-brick”) invested $1.2 million in seed finance, and established a strategic partnership with GridGlo — a smart grid technology startup from Delray Beach, Florida, the companies revealed today.
GridGlo sells software and services that help utilities see how and why their customers, primarily homeowners, are using electricity in real-time. They also provide utilities with an Energy People Scoring Mechanism, or EPM score that the company hopes will become a standard like the FICO score is to credit card issuers and other financial institutions.
The EPM (see screenshots, below) is based on four criteria: how much power a customer uses and from which sources including things like rooftop solar panels (consumption); how efficient a consumer is compared to neighboring customers or their own past behavior (efficiency); whether or not they frequently try or are willing to try things that the utility suggests like buying a more efficient refrigerator or shutting off the air conditioner during peak hours (engagement); and whether or not the consumer is consistent in their energy related habits (predictability).

How is GridGlo’s offering different from those of well-established smart grid intelligence businesses, like OPOWER, Silver Spring Networks and Comverge?
The chief executive of GridGlo, Isais Sudit, explained:

“Several companies doing great things to move the market forward, here. At GridGlo, we’re using a deeper level of analytics, though, and handling a greater amount of data — 1,300 criteria to start — than any other companies in the energy space. Also, we focus strictly on helping the utilities. We don’t have a consumer-facing app or product. It is our aim to help the utilities offer what works best for their business, and their market to the energy consumer.
Our technology can tell a utility if their customers are married, have kids, living in a 5,000 square foot home, if and when they installed solar panels, if they  drive a hybrid electric vehicle, if they had the same job for the last ten years, haven’t moved in that time and more. You put those components together and you begin to build an understanding of how this is all related to energy consumption.
When that happens, your relationships with customers improve, and your business becomes more predictable.”



Ostensibly, if utilities can make sense of a plethora of energy data — coming in every fifteen minutes or even more quickly from smart meters, smart appliances and home energy management systems — and fuse it with other available information about their customers, they will be able to motivate those customers to use electricity more efficiently, or to use electricity from renewable and clean sources more often.
GridGlo is still in a proof-of-concept phase, Sudit admitted. He could not yet provide firm evidence that the EPM, or other GridGlo technology will actually help utilities engender this behavioral change — yet.

737,"America's First Pipeline-Fed, Hydrogen Fueling Station Now Open In Los Angeles",https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/11/us-first-hydrogen-fueling-station/,2011/05/11," America’s first pipeline-fed, retail hydrogen fueling station opened in Torrance, California, within Los Angeles county on Tuesday. The station will provide hydrogen for fuel cell and hybrid vehicles in the area. It was built through a joint effort by Toyota, Air Products and Shell alternative energies, with funding from the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The station’s first customer was the owner of a Honda FCX Clarity.
A handful of hydrogen fuel cell black cabs have already hit the streets in London. Hydrogen fuel cell forklifts are already widely available, and used in warehouse fleets from Wal-Mart to Whole Foods. Fuel cell cars — promised by manufacturers including Toyota, Daimler, GM, Honda, and Hyundai — are not slated for mass market availability until 2015, though. The dominant clean vehicle technology available in the U.S. remains the battery electric vehicle.
Fuel cells cars are said to* produce no greenhouse gas emissions. In actuality, they produce H2O (water vapor is a greenhouse gas) and CO2 depending on the source of the hydrogen used. Most industrial hydrogen is produced from the reformation of hydrocarbons. [Ed’s note: Before publishing this post, I was unable to verify from Shell, Toyota or Air Products what the exact source of hydrogen was for this L.A. station, or how carbon intensive its production process might be.]
They have a 130- to 430-mile range (according to Toyota’s statements about its own fuel cell vehicles). Battery electric vehicles, so far, offer a much shorter range, and can only go up to 200 miles before recharging, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. On the other hand, battery electric vehicles can be charged at home, while fuel cell vehicles require special fueling stations at this point.
Among others, Honda is working on a “home energy station” for to generate hydrogen at home for fuel cells. A bevy of electric vehicle chargers are already on the market, however, including from Coulomb, Aerovironment and ECOtality.
As noted on the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) Fuel Cell Test and Evaluation Center (FCTec) website: Sir William Grove developed the first fuel cell in England in 1839, and in the 1950s, NASA and General Electric (GE) scientists developed the “Grubb-Niedrach fuel cell,” which became the first in the world to be used commercially.
Is the U.S. still leading the commercialization of fuel cells, globally? The executive director of the Fuel Cell & Hydrogen Energy Association (FCHEA), Ruth F. Cox, put things in perspective:


“There are somewhere around 600 [highway legal] fuel cell electric vehicles on the road, today. There are probably fewer than 50 different vehicle models in very limited production, now. That’s worldwide. We have about 150 of these vehicles [driving around] in the U.S.  We also have twenty some hydrogen fueling stations here, in California.
While the U.S. has led in terms of innovation, here, other countries have taken the lead in terms of building government and industry partnerships that bring together the oil and gas industry, alternative fueling companies, and the auto industry around an orchestrated plan for the deployment of infrastructure to support fuel cell vehicles.
Japan has made a commitment to deliver hundreds of refueling stations by 2015. Germany has committed to delivering thousands of stations by 2020.
As the technology matures, this will improve. Looking at battery electric vehicles, only thousands have been sold in the U.S. so far. It’s simply going to take some time.”

*The passage above was corrected and appended, May 11, 2011, 12:10 ET. A representative of the Fuel Cell & Hydrogen Energy Association referred to fuel cell vehicles as zero emissions vehicles in an interview. That statement was not meant literally, but I repeated the phrase in an earlier edition of this post. I’ve added details to clarify and maintain accuracy at the suggestion of commenter @Ben Kellie.

738,"Cattle Vaccine, Chip Verification Software Take Top Prizes At 2011 Moot Corp. Competition",https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/09/bplan-winners-mccombs-2011/,2011/05/09,"
 TNG Pharmaceuticals, developers of a vaccine to keep cattle free of blood-sucking horn flies, took top prize at the “Moot Corp.” business competition this weekend.
Formally renamed the Venture Labs Investment Competition(VLIC) in 2010, but still widely referred to as “Moot Corp.,” the annual event began in 1984 at the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas, Austin. At Moot, TNG Pharmaceuticals won a prize package including: $25,000 in cash; a range of free and discounted consulting and business services, and a full-page ad in Inc. magazine. The total value of the prize package, according to a McCombs spokesman is around $135,000.
TNG Pharmaceuticals’ chief executive, Jenny Corbin, said the company plans to use its winnings from McCombs — and from previous competitions held by the University of Cincinnati, the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, and at Rice University — to develop and test manufacturing processes for their cattle vaccine, FlyVax, then advance it through federal regulatory processes.
Corbin, who grew up and has worked around horses and cattle her entire life, explained the vaccine’s potential impact to the cattle industry:
“The horn fly causes an economic pain of $1 billion to the [cattle] industry in North America, annually. It makes cows lose weight and it decreases their dairy yield. It stresses them so that beef producers get less steak, dairy producers get less milk, and have to spend more time taking care of their cows.” 

According to competition finals judge Mike Dodd, a partner at Austin Ventures, TNG Pharmaceuticals locked first prize because:
“The team was experienced and well-versed in [biosciences] and intellectual property, while understanding the dairy, meat and leather industry. They told us about the way the industry is dealing with the horn fly problem today. It is with something like a flea collar. It’s actually a tag that goes around the cows’ ears, and it doesn’t really work that well. Looking at an average annual population of 94 million cows in North America, there’s a huge problem. This vaccine could solve it.”

Another finals judge, Betty Otter-Nickerson, president of Sage North America’s Healthcare Division, added:
“TNG Pharmaceuticals’ biggest risk is a regulatory risk. Can they get through all the U.S.D.A. and F.D.A. stuff in the time period that they said they could? They have credible people on their board, supporting a time frame they’ve outlined. That helped them win.”

Second-place winners at the competition, Reveal Design Automation, created software to help chip makers avoid costly mistakes, and long delays in the verification and manufacture of their chip designs. The team is spinning its technology out from the University of Michigan.
Tech entrepreneur and investor Mike Maples, Sr. (who is also the father of Floodgate’s Mike Maples Jr.) judged at the Moot Corp semifinals this year, and observed:
“Reveal Design Automation is working on some very big problems. Their technology is supposed to do things like verify that millions of circuits are lined up properly, and make chip design verification thousands of times faster than what’s possible today. Even if the company has just a hundred potential customers — who would be [the makers] of next generation ARM processors — these are customers spending an awful lot of time and money on engineers to design, test and release those chips.”

Reveal Design Automation took hom $5,000 in cash from Moot Corp.
Last year’s Moot Corp. winners, Biologics MD, went on to secure a $2.3 million grant from the U.S. Department of Defense in January this year to continue testing and developing a drug that treats osteoporosis.
Biologics MD president Paul Mlakar wrote to TechCrunch this weekend: “We have actually started some of the pre-clinical work, and hope to move into our own lab space in July. We are also evaluating additional technologies that fit within our expertise and will add value to the company.”

739,Hybrid Motoryacht Design Powered By Diesel And Electric Jet Skis,https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/07/hybrid-motoryacht-design-powered-by-diesel-and-electric-jet-skis/,2011/05/07,"
Hybrid cars have been around for a while, but one German grad student is taking the concept to the water. A new hybrid propulsion motorboat designed by Stefanie Behringer, would reduce drag thanks to its three-hull, or trimaran, form.
A jet ski attaches to either side of the main hull, helping stabilize the boat. While the jet skis are electric-powered, the 49-foot long watercraft is also powered by two diesel engines that use Audi’s turbo-charged injection technology. Audi’s Concept Design team in Munich worked with Behringer on the project.

The motoryacht is designed to reach speeds of close to 30 knots. The boat can be operated using only the 100-horsepower jet skis for a mellow, emission-free cruise around the bay. At faster speeds, the diesel engines recharge the jet skis’ batteries.

Twelve people can fit on the deck, with room for a few more below. The main deck is designed to feel like a lounge, and a glass roof shields passengers from wind and sun exposure.

This is a neat concept, but it might be a while before this boat is spotted in the harbor. Audi has not announced plans to move the motoryacht yacht beyond the concept phase.

740,"Who's In? U.S. Solar Industry Bands Together To Cut Costs, Make Panels Better",https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/06/pvmc-solar-collaboration/,2011/05/06," The U.S. solar industry is banding together to fend off an onslaught of global competition, and to lower the cost of manufacturing solar technology domestically. To make it happen, the newly formed U.S. Photovoltaic Manufacturing Consortium (PVMC) secured a $57.5 million federal grant from the Department of Energy Sunshot Initiative, along with financial commitments totaling $400 million from various state and corporate entities.
Today, the PVMC revealed (in an exclusive to TechCrunch) who its earliest members are, including cleantech businesses more often seen as competitors, not collaborators. The list, which follows at the end of this post, encompasses raw material suppliers, the makers of metrology, modules and other solar equipment, major universities, and high-tech research and development laboratories. They are focused on thin film, or copper-indium-gallium-selenide (CIGS) technology in particular.
Some thin film solar basics…
CIGS solar photovoltaics work by absorbing solar photons and converting part of that energy into electricity, or storing part of it in a chemical reaction. CIGS solar panels, unlike others, can be manufactured so that they’re flexible and comparatively lightweight, which means they can be incorporated into a variety of architectural designs and space-limited applications.
In the first quarter of 2011, according to research by the Cleantech Group, venture capitalists invested $641 million in 26 deals in U.S. solar companies. MiaSolé, a thin-film panel maker, closed the largest round in that period, $106 million from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Firelake Capital and VantagePoint Venture Partners.

PVMC members will share high-tech facilities and equipment, and academic resources at the U-Albany (in New York, image above) and the University of Central Florida.
It’s high-tech collaborative consumption.
Michael Fancher, an associate professor of nano-economics at U-Albany’s College of Nanoscale Science & Engineering, who helped set up the PVMC explained:

“As academic hosts, we help each company pursue and protect their own product development, and work in a collaborative way that lets them recoup part of their overhead.
You could easily have competitors with similar process steps who are making CIGS solar photovoltaics. They’d typically operate within a facility they own. They might have one proprietary tool for one part of their manufacturing process that they’re changing up, and testing out.
With this facility and consortium, if you have to demo how your company’s new process step performs in an integrated process flow, you can put your tool in a [manufacturing] line, then another tool. You run the line on each, then compare the results. One might deposit materials using thermal deposition. Another might use sputtering deposition. You can reconfigure the line to demo these, and see where thing improve. But you don’t have to go out, and build your company its own entire line.”

This concept is nothing new. Years ago, the Austin-founded, now Albany-based SEMATECH did for the chip industry what PVMC aims to do for solar. (Sematech helped fund and form the solar consortium.)

Is this enough to mainstream clean energy?
Cleantech investor Michael DeRosa, managing director at Element Partners, believes:

“Early stage tech development gets more attention from cleantech investors in the U.S. We don’t have enough big money invested in the types of things that really need massive deployment, and are ready for that today. The private sector is not investing nearly enough in clean energy— not even close given the magnitude of the opportunity, and the problem, especially in the last couple of years.
Part of this is because government regulation [favoring renewable energy] isn’t happening, and it isn’t likely to happen this year. We could see a bunch hedge funds that used to pull in millions continue to drop out. What’s going to fill that gap?
Certainly government grants and collaboration can help. In the whole history of cleantech investing, though — and you’ve heard this before— we’ve invested less than a handful of days of Exxon’s revenue. I’d like to see the next half billion spent on deployable technology that can put a dent in our foreign oil dependence, now.”


Element Partners’ investments range within the cleantech sector from a natural gas vehicle technology company, Agility Fuel Systems, to an electric vehicle manufacturer, Think Global AS, from solar and wind businesses (Petra Solar and Wasatch Wind) to companies that help coal and oil businesses generate more energy from existing resources, with lower impact to the environment.

742,"Bill Gates On Nuclear Energy: Compared To Coal, It Is Still Safer In Terms Of People ""Killed Per Kilowatt Hour""",https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/03/bill-gates-nuclear/,2011/05/03,"

After the nuclear disaster in Japan at the Fukushima reactors, the general public is understandably skittish about nuclear energy once again.  But not Bill Gates. Speaking today at a Wired business conference in New York City, he is talking up the benefits of nuclear energy, particularly next-generation designs.  The backlash, he thinks, is overblown.  “If you compare it to the amount that coal has killed per kilowatt hour,” he points out, “it is way, way less.”  When an accident does occur, however, its effects are much more visible.  “Coal kills fewer people at one time, which is highly preferred by politicians,” he says.
Gates is putting his money where his mouth is.  He is an investor in his friend Nathan Myrhvold’s nuclear reactor startup Terrapower, which is designing one such next-generation nuclear reactor which produces one thousandth as much radioactive waste.  But he also has investments in “dozens” of other energy companies, from battery companies to solar to biofuels.  “We should pursue them all,” he says. “The amount of IQ working on energy today and the tools they have to simulate compared to 20 years ago is night and day, but it is unpredictable whether we will get a breakthrough.”
Solar and wind power have great potential, but they are intermittent sources of power.  That is why Gates is bullish on nuclear.  Advances in energy are necessary for the economy in general to keep moving forward, he argues.  Gates sees three main problems which need to be addressed: cost, security, and environmental impact: “Other than it is too expensive, you can get cut off at any time, or it can destroy the planet, it’s okay.”
Cost is the key challenge new energy sources must surmount.  “We get sloppy” in the rich world, he says, because we can afford to pay extra for solar or wind power.  But in order to make a real impact, the costs have to become competitive with current fossil-based energy.  “In 80% of the world, energy will be bought where it is economic.” says Gates.  “You have to help the rest of the world get energy at a reasonable price.”
WHat about distributed energy where every house generates their own and feeds it back into the grid?  Gates thinks that is a “cute” idea, but “it’s not gonna happen.”  Bigger power generation facilities, such as solar fields in the desert, are necessary.  “If you are going for cuteness, go after the those things at the home.  If you want to solve the energy problem go after the big things in the desert.”

743,"Enecsys Closes £25 million ($41 million) To Sell Solar Microinverters, Stateside",https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/03/enecsys-series-b/,2011/05/03," A Cambridge, England cleantech company, Enecsys, closed a £25 million ($41 million) series B round which the company plans to use to take its solar microinverter technology to more international markets including Canada and the U.S.
Solar microinverters convert the DC power that’s produced by solar panels into AC power, that can be either be used on-site, or sent back to the electrical grid. The Enecsys microinverters are designed for residential use and smaller, commercial solar installations instead of for huge, utility-scale solar farms.
Climate Change Capital led the round with an investment of £11 million ($18 million) in Enecsys. The remaining £14 million ($23 million) came from the company’s existing backers: Wellington Partners, NES Partners and Good Energies. To date, the company has raised about $55.3 million in venture capital.
According to a company press statement, Enecsys’ solar inverters are: “installed on the rail behind solar modules, either one inverter per solar module or one for every two modules.” The technology is meant to help the owners of installed, solar PV systems to: monitor and optimize the performance of their solar panels, remotely via web apps; and to harvest more power from the panels than alternative technologies like DC wiring around an installation would. The company claims it can harvest 5 to 20 percent more energy than a traditional set-up.
In a market that’s increasingly commoditized, a huge number of microinverter companies have attained significant venture funding, including: Enphase, Petra Solar, SolarBridge and DirectGrid. The startups also compete against incumbent, global players like SMA Solar, which makes inverters and software that help optimize the performance of both solar and wind systems, and Transform Solar, which makes and installs a wide range of solar technology. Only a few can lead the market, of course.

744,Cobalt Technologies Raises $20 Million To Make Plant-Based Jet Fuel And Paint,https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/02/cobalt-tech-series-d/,2011/05/02,"Cobalt Technologies, a cleantech startup in Mountain View that develops and makes biobutanol, closed a $20 million series D funding round, the company revealed today. The investment arm of Parsons & Whittemore (the Whittemore Collection) led the round, joined by all of Cobalt’s earlier venture backers: Pinnacle Ventures, Malaysian Life Sciences Capital Fund, VantagePoint Capital Partners, Life Sciences Partners (LSP), @Ventures, Harris & Harris and Burrill and Company.
Primarily, Cobalt Technologies turns non-food crops into “n-butanol,” which is used to make a variety of paints and coatings, as well as renewable chemicals used to make jet fuel.
The U.S. Department of Energy defines biobutanol as: “…an alcohol that can be produced through processing of domestically grown crops, such as corn and sugar beets, and other biomass, such as fast-growing grasses and agricultural waste products.” Biobutanol generally has greater energy density than ethanol.
According to its own press statement, Cobalt will use its $20 million series D capital to build a 470,000 gallon-per-year demonstration plant in Alpena, Michigan. The company’s chief executive officer, Rick Wilson, explained further, in an interview by phone on Monday:
“Our Alpena facility will start up around April 2012. We located this facility by a factory called DPI. What they do is make decorative panels from wood. They bring in wood chips and shavings, and cook it so it sticks together. From that process, you end up with sugars, not the kind you’d necessarily want to eat. We ferment and use a non-genetically modified organism to convert that to butanol. We could use corn or sugar, but that’s $300 to $500 a ton. Wood chips are $60 to $80 a ton.”

The company will generate some revenue from the biobutanol it produces in Alpena. It will use that revenue and the remainder of its series D round to begin development of its first commercial facilities; and continue developing bio jet fuel(s) for use by the U.S. Navy, which struck a partnership deal with Cobalt in late 2010.
In January 2010, the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Department of Agriculture set up several goals, including that by 2020, the Navy’s total energy consumption for ships, aircraft, tanks, vehicles and shore installations would come from alternative sources, including biofuels.
Unlike other sector players such as Solazyme* — a company that uses algae to make biofuels and chemicals, and supplies these to the U.S. Navy as well — or SG Biofuels, which uses non-edible jatropha seeds, Cobalt’s process draws on feedstocks that are often a byproduct of food and paper makers.
*Correction: In an earlier version of this post, I mistakenly called Solazyme a public company. Solazyme filed to go public but has not yet had an initial public offering.

745,"More Funding, Fewer Deals For Cleantech In Q1 2011, Solar Dominates And Storage Rises",https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/02/cleantech-vc-up-yoy/,2011/05/02,"According to a report out today from Ernst & Young and Dow Jones VentureSource, American venture capitalists invested 54 percent more, by dollar amount, in cleantech companies for the first quarter in 2011 versus the same period last year. The sector attracted $1.14 billion for the quarter up from $743.3 million in Q1 2010. The number of deals attracting venture capital in the sector declined, however, by 13 percent from 79 to 69.
Energy or electricity generation, especially solar businesses, and later stage rounds dominated. The energy and electricity generation segment raised $450.3 million through 16 deals or about 39.5 percent of total dollars raised for the quarter. Solar ventures attracted $362.7 million, or about 32 percent of total dollars raised for the quarter, a 162 percent increase for the segment over the same period last year.
MiaSole, makers of copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) thin-film photovoltaic solar panels, was the largest deal of the quarter. The company raised $106 million in a series F round led by Voyageur Mutual Funds III; its earlier backers included Kleiner Perkins, Firelake Capital and VantagePoint Venture Partners. Another CIGS manufacturer, Solopower, raised about $52 million from Crosslink Capital, Hudson Clean Energy Partners, and Norwegian firm Convexa.
Alta Devices, raised $72 million to improve the efficiency of solar photovoltaics, and deliver them at very low costs, using gallium arsenide. Investors in that round included their earlier backers: August Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, Crosslink Capital, DAG Ventures, New Enterprise Associates (NEA), Presidio Ventures, Technology Partners, Dow Chemical, and newer investors Alberta Investment Management Corporation (AIMCo), Good Energies, Energy Technology Ventures (the joint venture involving GE, ConocoPhilips and NRG Energy), and Constellation Energy.
All three of the above-mentioned solar companies are based in California. The state drew 56 percent of total dollars funded, about $637.2 million, an increase of 41 percent year over year for the California cleantech sector. Cleantech companies in the southeastern U.S. raised $150.2 million, a huge leap for the region, and New England cleantech businesses drew $174.23 million.
The energy storage segment also saw larger investments. Energy storage deals rose 671 percent (by dollars invested) versus the first quarter of 2010, reaching a total of $262.4 million through 14 deals. Battery companies attracted $121 million of that, having raised only $8 million from January through March 2010. Fuel cell businesses attracted $106 million for the quarter. Two deals accounted for 64 percent of dollars raised for the whole energy storage segment— Bloom Energy, whose technology has been both ballyhooed and scrutinized, raised the lion’s share with a $100 million round.
Alternative fuels, a category that includes both natural gas and biofuels, raised $160 million, or 14 percent of the total dollars raised in the quarter with the majority of those dollars going to biofuels businesses.
One subsegment of cleantech, energy efficiency, dipped by 49 percent. These companies raised $95 million in the first quarter, versus $187 million for the same period in 2010 according to the report.

746,Can I Get Some Sustainability With That Shake?,https://techcrunch.com/2011/04/29/epa-impact-fried-food/,2011/04/29," This week, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued Energy Star ratings for large vat commercial fryers. These appliances are used by high-volume dining establishments — like fast food chains, institutional cafeterias and full-service restaurants— to make french fries, hush puppies and anything else Paula Deen would promote, in bulk.
Encouraging the industry to upgrade to more energy-efficient fryers could help reduce the overall environmental (if not health) impact of kitchens in the U.S. catering to the collective appetite for fried foods, an appetite that seems pervasive, and permanent here. One Texan cook, Mark Zable, has even invented a method to make deep-fried beer.
According to a press statement and calculations by the EPA:
” If every large vat fryer in the [country] met the new Energy Star requirements, energy cost savings would increase approximately $81 million per year and reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to the emissions from nearly 95,000 cars.”

The lifetime costs and footprint of commercial frying goes beyond the electricity and gas that it takes to run kitchen equipment, of course. Certain vegetable oils are more sustainable than others. Spent grease, and even vegetable oil, can become a pollutant unless disposed of properly.
Many food businesses are opting to give or sell their spent grease to biofuel producers, these days, thankfully.
Bon Appétit Management Company — which provides sustainable food in cafes at SF Giants stadium, eBay, Oracle, Google and college campuses including U-Penn, Duke and MIT — has been doing this for years, in collaboration with local biofuel companies like Kelley Green Biofuel for example.
This month (as Tilde Herrera reported for Greenbiz.com) U.S. Foodservice went so far as to acquire a “grease diesel” company, WVO Industries. The foodservice business will begin to power its truck fleets with their own spent cooking oil, allowing them to avoid the rising costs of gasoline here.
Ultimately, foods that are sautéed, boiled, toasted, roasted or prepared raw will prove better for the body and planet than deep-fried with rare — no pun intended — exception.
There is no official carbon footprint label for food here, but a sustainability blogger and small business owner in Germany, Peter Graf  (not to be confused with Peter Graf, chief sustainability officer at SAP) has shared some rough calculations via his blog Ecofriendly-Company.com. He wrote:

“The path from potato to french fry takes 9 steps.The potatoes are…

   1. Steamed and peeled,
   2. Cut
   3. Blanched
   4. Dried
   5. Par-fried
   6. Cooled
   7. Frozen
   8. Transported
   9. Stored frozen

Then, they’re fried in hot oil in the canteen and served. All this transforms a single kilo of potatoes (140g CO2) into a real climate-killer (5700g CO2).”

747,Genomatica Exporting Sustainable Chemicals Technology To Asia,https://techcrunch.com/2011/04/28/genomatica-mitsubishi-jv/,2011/04/28," One of the largest chemical companies in Asia, Mitsubishi Chemical Corp. in Japan, has formed a partnership with San Diego, Calif.-based Genomatica, a sustainable chemicals startup, the companies revealed today.
Genomatica converts sugar from corn wet mills, sugar cane and sugar beet — among other sources — into butanediol (BDO), a chemical used to make everything from the plastics in consumer electronics and cars, to the spandex and foam found in athletic shoes and apparel.
The chief executive and founder of Genomatic, Christophe Schilling, explained:

“Our scientists used computational modeling and simulation of metabolism to study how living cells function, then designed and developed organisms that produce BDO directly from sugar. No other company does this, and there’s no naturally occurring organism that makes BDO. We project — using renewable feedstock and our proprietary processes — we will save on the order of 70 perecent of CO2-emissions, and use 60 percent less energy to produce BDO, and other chemicals.”

Through their partnership Mitsubishi Chemical and Genomatica plan to: build the first commercial “bio-BDO” plant in Asia as a joint venture; and to develop additional, sustainable chemicals and applications using Genomatica’s technology.
Mitsubishi is an equity investor in Genomatica, and was part of the company’s recent, $45 million Series C-1 funding round. In total, the startup has raised about $85 million from investors including: Alloy Ventures, Bright Capital, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, Mohr Davidow Ventures, TPG Biotech, VantagePoint Venture Partners and Waste Management.

748,"Sizing Up Apps For EV Drivers: Coulomb Upgrades, ECOtality Goes Mobile, And Xatori Grows Community",https://techcrunch.com/2011/04/25/apps-for-electric-vehicle-drivers/,2011/04/25," How many apps does it take to recharge a vehicle? Apparently, one is not enough. Several companies offering mobile apps to drivers — to help them find a place to charge up or refuel in an environmentally sustainable way — made product and milestone announcements around Earth Day. Here’s the run down.
ECOtality (NASDAQ: ECTY) — a San Francisco company that’s building electric vehicle (EV) technology and infrastructure in the U.S. and China— unveiled its Blink Network mobile app (screenshot, above) to help users find and reserve a nearby, available charging station at the Electric Drive Transportation Association conference in Washington D.C. Reservation and status-update features made ECOtality’s app distinct from other charger-finders for about a minute.
On Monday, however, Coulomb Technologies announced an upgrade to the ChargePoint app, including similar functionality. ECOtality’s app will be available for English-language users of iOS and Android devices in the next few weeks via BlinkNetwork.com, while Coulomb’s ChargePoint app is available now.
Both companies map the charging stations within the networks that they install, own and operate on behalf of their customers. Both companies supply stations and software to: companies with large vehicle fleets; employers that want to offer EV charging at work; retail store and garage owners; homeowners; and municipalities or utilities.
Several other web and mobile charging station finders, however, map any and all charging stations — which could make more sense for cross-country drivers. One such app is provided by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the Alternative Fueling Station Locator. The app uses Google Maps technology to show the location of publicly accessible EV charging stations, clean vehicle equipment suppliers, and biodiesel, hydrogen and other alternative fueling stations.
The open source site CarStations.com, which is expected to spin out a mobile product this year, includes user-contributed data a la Wikipedia to show charging and clean fuel stations.
A newer entrant, the PlugShare app by Xatori (images, below) maps publicly accessible charging stations, along with volunteer homes or businesses that are willing to share their outlets with EV and hybrid-plugin drivers.

PlugShare today claimed that its users comprise the “largest consumer electric vehicle charging network” in the United States. According to company reports, about 1,500 outlets have been shared under the PlugShare collaborative consumption model to-date, across 48 states in the U.S. The app has 13,000 some users so far.
Xatori chief technology officer*, Armen Petrosian, said that PlugShare is functioning as a kind of social network, and discussed features the company plans to add to it:

We are seeing two main types of communication occurring in the [PlugShare] network. One type of communication occurs between members who have shared outlets 10 to 100 miles apart…and are making a request to charge when one member is away from home. Users who are 5 miles apart or less— [sometimes want] to chat with a like-minded individual. I’ve experienced this first-hand as several members in my neighborhood have contacted me just to say hello, see if I have an EV, etc.
There are a number of features that we hope to add [to PlugShare] but a couple stand out right now. One is a reputation system so users can rate charging locations (private and public) and add comments. The second is a way to add or edit public charging station information, so that it can be kept up-to-date by the community.


Xatori has not yet determined how the open data and volunteer-inspiring app will generate revenue. The company is focused on building a large user base, first.
Meanwhile, Coulomb’s ChargePoint app helps the company generate fees from mobile payments— fifty cents per transaction, plus 7.5% of whatever the station-owner adds as a transactional fee for drivers.
 A veteran engineer and advocate for clean vehicles, Kristen Helsel, vice president of EV Solutions at Aerovironment, believes that apps of the greatest use to electric vehicle drivers, and the industry, should present data about charging stations agnostically. Aerovironment’s own EV charger technology is sold on a “white label” basis, and is included in a number of other brands’ stations and networks. Helsel explained her position further:

“At Aerovironment, we work to enable all of the mapping services to have the most up to date information about where we install public charging stations. We don’t expect customers just to rely on us. What’s really important is that the information is available, and that drivers experience confidence when they want to access EV infrastructure.
It will be just as important in the future to make data available about all renewables; where are the chargers that are powered by wind or solar, where are the biofuel stations? The networks can go up, and can be limited. But we have to have open architecture in terms of the data.”


Richard Lowenthal, founder and chief technology officer of Coulomb Technologies noted:


“Home grown apps are great. They don’t offer features, and real-time data like we can. We offer [back-end] support with billing and asset management that tells you which stations are working and not, lets our customers [who purchase Coulomb’s charging stations] set pricing and more. We have phone support for drivers; if someone is having trouble charging, they don’t go into the store, or to the receptionist, they call our 1-800 number.
As long as we need to offer our own app to show off all of the benefits and features of our network, we will add to and offer it as a standalone. We do have an open API and offer data to everyone who wants it, PlugShare, TomTom, NREL or anyone. We are not trying to stifle any of them, in fact it’s quite the opposite.”

ECOTality’s president and chief executive officer, Jonathan R. Read, believes there is value in providing an app that’s brand-specific, as well. In an interview with TechCrunch he said:

“I take my hat off to the community service providers, I really do. There’s sort of a brotherhood in the industry. I think that for this EV movement and charge infrastructure to succeed, though, it has to be commercially viable. We cannot rely on good will and trust, or government completely.
We need to make sure that EVs and charge infrastructure can stand alone, make money, be profitable so [clean energy] can proliferate with or without subsidies and volunteers.
I think the task of building EV infrastructure in the U.S. will be somewhat like the early stages of the cell phone business. We look to create the largest network, and provide the greatest depth of service through our apps. We’ve built the Blink Network app to be a part of an overall system that will eventually include not just the ability to make reservations, but also to make payments, use home energy management programs and devices on the go, experience connectivity and access a network of hundreds of thousands of charging stations.” 

ECOtality — with the help of a recovery act grant from the DOE — is set to install approximately 5,700 commercial charging stations in the U.S. by the end of this year.

749,Food Is The New Frontier In Green Tech,https://techcrunch.com/2011/04/24/ali-partovi-fix-food/,2011/04/24,"
This is a guest post from Ali Partovi, angel investor, startup advisor and serial entrepreneur. He co-founded iLike, acquired by Myspace in 2009, and LinkExchange, acquired by Microsoft for $265 million in 1998. His portfolio has included successes as far-ranging as Zappos, Facebook, DropBox and OPOWER. He was among the first to recognize the significance of the Facebook platform, and among the earliest to grasp the business opportunity of search.
Around Earth Day, we’re reminded about global warming and pollution, as well as the “green” technologies and consumer choices that may save our planet. We don’t hear as much about agriculture, one of the world’s largest polluters, nor do we appreciate the environmental impact of our diet.
According to research by the World Resources Institute, agriculture is mankind’s biggest contributor to climate change, generating at least 26 percent of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide — more than from all electricity and industry or from all the world’s planes, trains and automobiles. Other estimates suggest agriculture generates 36 percent of emissions.
Feeding the growing world population using today’s practices is increasingly unsustainable. Just as we need new technologies in areas like renewable energy, we need more “renewable” approaches to producing the most primal form of energy: food. Brace yourself for this two-minute video from the University of Minnesota, which summarizes the problem with some startling facts:

As an Internet entrepreneur and investor, my interest in food and agriculture began at home, taking care of my body and my kids. In 2008, my wife and I decided to adopt a healthier and more sustainable diet for our family. We switched to exclusively grass-fed meat and ate a bit less meat altogether, added more vegetables, and began raising egg-laying chickens in our backyard. That enabled our seven-year-old daughter to run a startup selling our egg surplus (image, below).
I was pleased to lose about 35 pounds within six months. But I was also surprised to find how inconvenient, obfuscated, and expensive it was simply to eat healthful, natural foods. I began studying the business and politics of food, convinced there must be investment opportunities that align with improving the system. Surely, I thought, there must be healthful, sustainable, yet scalable and profitable alternatives to our unsustainable food and agriculture sectors.
As a student of the space, I’ve seen enough parallels between food and energy to posit that food may be the next frontier in green tech. Like energy, food and agriculture are big, slow, and highly regulated sectors. But also like renewable energy, there might be opportunities for innovation and profit in “renewable food,” fueled by consumer preference today and by shifts in policy tomorrow.

Within the giant food sector the “organic” segment is growing fast thanks to a combination of consumer consciousness and government support. Organic food has enjoyed double-digit growth in the U.S. for two decades (from $1 billion in 1990 to almost $25 billion in 2009) and is growing to over $100 billion globally by 2015. Yet, organic agriculture still represents only one percent of U.S. farmland today. That leaves plenty of room for growth and opportunities for entrepreneurs and investors, especially given the increasingly apparent ties between food and global warming.
“The Other Inconvenient Truth”
We cannot forever feed ourselves on fossil fuel, deforestation, and greenhouse gas emissions.
Today’s food and agriculture practices consume enormous amounts of fossil fuel for transportation, operation of farm machinery, and chemical production of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides: roughly 10 calories of fossil fuel go into every calorie of food we eat, representing 19% of all U.S. energy consumption.
Agriculture emits greenhouse gases with an order of magnitude worse global-warming potency than CO2, such as methane (from intensive livestock operations and rice fields) and nitrous oxide (from fertilizers and factory farm waste lagoons). Another agricultural emission, nitric oxide, is the main driver of the new acid rain that is killing forests and fish. Run-off of excess fertilizer from cropland and excess manure from factory farms is the primary cause of enormous aquatic dead zones in coastal waters globally, devastating marine life (and ironically, threatening human seafood supply). These marine dead zones in aggregate represent 95,000 square miles (about 20 times larger than the area impacted by last year’s BP oil spill).
Agriculture is overwhelmingly the biggest cause of global deforestation (image, below), driven by livestock and growing Western demand for food commodities like palm oil.

There is hope of mitigating these issues. Via “new” techniques it should be possible for the food and agriculture sector not only to reduce its own emissions, but also to offset emissions from other sectors by removing carbon from the atmosphere. (I say “new” because in many cases the solution involves a return to nature-based, less industrial processes.) More importantly, it should be possible to make money and improve the environment – because the current system is inefficient and wasteful, leaving enormous room to move the needle by eliminating waste.
I’ve encountered promising opportunities, and in several cases personally invested in startups tackling these problems as an angel investor.
Reducing Food Emissions
One way to reduce the carbon footprint of our food is by eating locally grown food, reducing the fuel spent on transportation. However, the practicality of this varies regionally. Here are some companies making local food more widely available.
In the San Francisco area where I live, farmers’ markets and CSA (community supported agriculture) programs enable consumers to buy food from local farms rather than from thousands of miles away. A CSA is a subscription that delivers weekly food from a local farm. Although this offers advantages to both consumer and farmer, such programs are less prevalent in other regions and represent a negligible fraction of the food sector.
A tech startup I invested in, Farmigo,  is stimulating this alternative food system for consumers to purchase directly from local farms, removing middlemen and reducing food transportation. Farmigo’s Web platform enables buying directly from a farm while simplifying logistics for farmers.
What about regions that simply don’t have the climate to produce fresh food year-round? If you live in the East Coast or Midwest, your lettuce and tomatoes have likely spent an expensive week riding thousands of miles in a refrigerated truck from Mexico or the West Coast. Another startup I’ve invested in, BrightFarms, aims to eliminate shipping costs by building greenhouses on the roofs of supermarkets, producing the most “local” food imaginable.

The business model is directly analogous to what’s scaled successfully in solar electricity– and not a coincidence, because both represent techniques of converting sunshine to energy that humans can use. BrightFarms is an excellent example of aligning environmental goals with profit by eliminating waste, because photosynthesis is very efficient, whereas trucking a tomato 3,000 miles in a fuel-guzzling fridge is not.
Transportation aside, agriculture’s carbon footprint includes the natural gas and petroleum consumed to produce chemical fertilizers and pesticides, as well as the nitrous oxide released to the air due to over-application of those fertilizers. A startup named Solum hopes to help on both sides, by enabling farmers to reduce fertilizer usage via more accurate, real-time measurement of soil chemistry. Solum is backed by Khosla Ventures, one of the world’s leading green-tech investors.
Carbon Sequestration
For millions of years, atmospheric carbon was trapped by photosynthesis and stored in the ground. Human agricultural practices have upset this balance.
For example, much of North America, once covered by carbon-trapping grass, has been transformed to grow corn, using fuel-intensive inputs and releasing greenhouse gases into the air from tilling and over-fertilization, largely to feed animals that eat grass in the first place. Cornfields require annual tilling, which releases soil carbon to the atmosphere. They conduct photosynthesis only part of the year, and most of the carbon and calories they capture stay in the kernels, soon to return into the air via digestion. Grass, on the other hand, is a carbon sink, burying most of its carbon and calories in the soil, where it remains.
Americans eat only a small fraction of the corn we produce and much of it in the guise of ingredients like high-fructose corn syrup that aren’t essential for human nutrition. About seven times more corn than what we eat is used to feed livestock like cattle (which can digest grass more easily than corn).
Livestock represents a disproportionate part of food’s carbon footprint. If more sustainable techniques are scalable, they might be among the most leveraged ways available to combat global warming. The Union of Concerned Scientists has recently stated that raising cattle on grass can be a net carbon sink whereas feedlot cattle operations are a net carbon emitter. Studies suggest that grassland sequesters more carbon than a forest. There is also evidence that grass traps more carbon when grazed, provided that the livestock be moved periodically (moderate grazing causes grass to grow back healthier, whereas clear-grazing kills the grass).
This sounds great for the environment, but is it economically feasible? The Savory Institute is using managed rotational grazing (MRG) techniques to restore America’s grassland while often doubling or even quadrupling livestock capacity at the same time.
The premise of MRG is to mimic the behavior of roaming ruminants that evolved over millions of years: a herd chews the grass, stimulating plant and root growth and letting sunlight reach the growth points. Then the herd moves on to greener pastures, leaving behind manure (fertilizer) and hoofprints that soften the soil and help water retention and seed germination. MRG mimics this by moving cattle from one plot of grass to another daily. Wild birds also fit in nature’s cycle: they follow a herd to feed on dung beetles, in the process providing pest control and spreading the manure. A new breed of farms mimics this by raising chickens in mobile cages and coops that are moved into a plot of land once the cattle have left it. Essentially, MRG uses livestock to do the job of fuel-intensive tractors, fertilizers, and pesticides.

Increased consumer awareness is fueling demand for 100 percent “grass-fed” or “pasture-raised” meat and poultry raised using these practices. A growing sustainable food movement, the culinary equivalent of renewable energy, is enabling Bay Area meat and poultry producer Marin Sun Farms (image, right) to enjoy an enviable combination of high-margin sales and exponential growth.
The biggest obstacle impeding Marin Sun Farms’ growth today is inadequate capital. It cannot secure land, water, and animals fast enough to meet the growing demand. This dynamic reminds me of the early days of Zappos, when Tony Hsieh was desperately seeking capital to secure shoes fast enough to meet the growing demand.
One might ask, is this scalable, or is it an anomalous niche? As it was for Zappos, that is the billion-dollar question, and I don’t know the answer. But it certainly makes basic economic sense. Feeding livestock on grass is patently efficient. The animals convert inedible, naturally occurring vegetation to human food, while recycling nutrients to sustain the grass, without requiring costly fuel-intensive chemicals or machinery.
How did we end up with a system so inefficient?
In the U.S., we’ve had decades of corn subsidies that motivate farmers to over-produce corn, resulting in a surfeit of corn that has skewed market dynamics. This has made it artificially “affordable” to feed corn even to animals that were never evolved to digest it (salmon, for example). Such subsidies might have made sense if America’s problems included a shortage of food calories. But today, we face different problems, such as a health-care and budget crisis, a fuel crisis, and a climate crisis. Our policies ought to reward farming practices that alleviate these problems. Consumer consciousness may be enough to make sustainable food profitable in the short-term; but in the long-term, shifts in policy are necessary.
The good news is that governmental policy can be aligned to help in more ways than one. The most elegant but most politically infeasible solution might be to cut corn subsidies. But there are many other regulatory levers. For example, government could offer a “grass subsidy” to reward land use that traps carbon in the soil, aligning with a broader carbon policy. The FDA has suggested that it might regulate antibiotic use in livestock, which would make our food system not only safer but also better for the environment.

Health-based efforts to combat obesity will likely help the environment as well. Carbs in our diet and carbon in our atmosphere are closely linked, and generally lead back to corn subsidies (AKA “carb subsidies”). Lastly, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture“Certified Organic” labeling program is a huge marketing boon to environment-friendly practices and can be expanded.
The government could offer additional subsidies to help farmers bridge the transition to organic, or tighten its criteria for animal products to support more carbon-neutral practices. For example, last year, the USDA released tightener standards for organic dairy, requiring that dairy animals be at least 30 percent grass-fed to qualify as “Organic.”
Conclusions
Our food and agriculture system is particularly broken, but we can’t simply wait for the government to fix it. As with clean energy, there are many opportunities for private enterprise to stimulate progress while making a profit. Some of the short-term opportunities in food might be to leverage consumer awareness and build a brand that stands for environmental consciousness, while aligning for longer-term regulatory changes to level the playing field.
Broader consumer awareness of the problem is critical, whether to make the private enterprise opportunities more scalable, or to precipitate political change. This is why I’m personally considering engaging more vigorously on this issue, using my background in social platforms and grassroots marketing to help more Americans discover the truths about their food and to build a movement to fix it. Please check out my one-day-old website FixFood.com and lend your voice there.
We cannot feed ourselves forever on the current system. The time for developing more sustainable alternatives is right now.

750,Act.ly Weathers Amazon Cloud Disaster On Earth Day,https://techcrunch.com/2011/04/22/actly-amazon-outage-earthday/,2011/04/22," Everyone’s favorite under-estimator of social media, Malcolm Gladwell, might get a chuckle out of Amazon’s EC2 problems this week. First, they took out Foursquare, Reddit and Quora service, as TechCrunch’s Mike Butcher reported yesterday. The disaster in the cloud also put a stop to those who would Tweet the revolution via Act.ly, a site that gets petitions going virally, online.
The site and service was still out of order as of publication. Act.ly founder Jim Gilliam said:
“We usually get several thousand activism tweets a day. That hasn’t happened for 36 hours, because of these issues with Amazon and another service provider we use, Heroku, also effected. I can’t access the data to tell you what our petition creation, retweets and general user interactions looked like last year on Earth Day, because I don’t have access right now. But the timing on something like this is a bit of a shame, really.”

According to Gilliam, petition creation and sharing tends to spike sharply around particular events, from the earthquake in Japan, to a calendar holiday like Earth Day. Act.ly petitions in the past have ranged from environmental to entertaining. They have encouraged “web citizens” to demand that phone manufacturers source materials used in their devices sustainably, or to get the EPA to regulate ostensibly harmful pesticides and food additives more carefully.
Staff members at The Young Turks, the popular political news series and site, regularly send out Act.ly petitions, and got in touch with Gilliam to vent and gripe about the Earth Day blackout.
Gilliam is also the founder of NationBuilder.com, a site that he says is not effected by the problems in the cloud.
Anyone can use Act.ly to whip up awareness and inspire problem solving around a cause, online — at least when it’s up and running.

751,"As Greenpeace Knocks IT Sector For Bad Energy Habits, Google Buys More Wind Power",https://techcrunch.com/2011/04/22/greenpeace-google-greenit/,2011/04/22," On Thursday, Greenpeace published a study on energy consumption and choices made by IT companies including Akamai, Amazon.com (Amazon Web Services), Apple, Facebook, Google, HP, IBM, Microsoft, Twitter, and Yahoo, entitled “How Dirty Is Your Data?”. The study roundly criticizes the sector, especially Facebook, for using “dirty energy” — power produced from hydrocarbon based sources, especially coal — to meet growing IT demand. It also criticized companies for concealing details about their own, overall energy footprint and practices.
Greenpeace specifically noted (excerpt from the environmental activists’ own summary):

Data centers, which house the explosion of virtual information, currently consume 1.5 to 2 percent of all global electricity and are growing at a rate of 12 percent each year
Companies in the sector, as a whole, do not release information on their energy use and its associated global warming emissions
One of the most popular social media companies, Facebook, is among the most dependent on coal-powered electricity at 53.2 percent


Shortly after their report circulated, Google announced that Google Energy LLC had signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) to buy 100.8 megawatts of wind-generated electricity to run its Okalahoma data centers from a  NextEra Energy Resources’s Minco II Wind Energy Center under development in Grady and Caddo counties in Oklahoma. The companies hope the wind plant will be operational in late 2011.
If you’re familiar with PPAs, skip this paragraph. If not, here’s some detail: PPAs are usually conditional agreements between a renewable energy development company and a power purchaser that really begin if or when a proposed facility comes online. This particular deal amounts to Google saying to NextEra Energy, we will buy this wind power if you build the facility and deliver the power as promised. Technically, there’s no guarantee when a PPA is signed that a given project will be completely financed, or completed at the scale proposed. Likewise, there’s no guarantee that the amount of energy produced by a proposed facility, will in reality live up to the amount offered through the PPA.
Even Greenpeace praised Google’s efforts, and issued a special statement to the press about Google’s new wind PPA. But how much of a difference do PPAs make? Are such purchases meaningful, in the grand scope of Google’s energy consumption?
TechCrunch reached out to Google’s green energy czar, Bill Weihl, to try to obtain further details. We asked: How much energy do Google’s data centers in Oklahoma consume in a year? How much power did Google consume, overall, last year? How much of that came from outside, renewable sources? How does Google measure its energy footprint? Does the company use metrics like those modeled by Global Reporting Initiative?
Weihl declined to comment on the nitty-gritty details, for now. He did note:

“We have cut our energy consumption by more than 50% over the last five to six years through improvements in server and data center designs. We’ve also been reporting the operational power usage at a number of our large facilities for more than two years.”

He referencesdthese reports which include Power Usage Effectiveness numbers, representing “the ratio of the total power consumed by a data center to the power consumed by the IT equipment that populate the facility.” (They’re not the user-friendly stats that some investors, environmentalists and energy professionals would prefer to see.)
Weihl was able to discuss what Google looks for as far as technology, projects or contracts in the green energy space. He said:


Efficiency is critical, but it is not enough…We will continue to look for improvements, there but we’re also working on these energy initiatives. We only invest in things that make economic sense over the long-term.
Here’s what we look for: If you’re talking about changing server architecture and the data center, we need to know what the capital cost is, and what’s the total cost of ownership going to be over the life of the equipment. In the case of a PPA, we need to know what are the power costs. On PPAs in particular, that whole area is complicated in some ways.
A big issue for Google is the question of “additionality.”  Basically, we ask: will our purchase [of power from a renewable energy provider] result in something new happening beyond business-as-usual.
If we go to our local utility, see they have 20% wind power they can offer, and ask them to assign that to us, are we considered that green? If the utility just assigned it to us, and the same amount of ground power is still going to other people, not reducing the emissions, then it’s not ideal.
We try hard to look for projects and agreements that result in more renewable power being put on the grid.


Whether the efforts of Google — and other IT giants — are enough to satisfy Greenpeace today, making IT cleaner, and more efficient is increasing in importance throughout the sector. A survey of 650 IT business executives, out from CompTIA research this week found: “In 2009 only 9 percent of firms rated green IT as an upper half organizational priority. That number rose to 37 percent in 2011, and is expected to rise to 54 percent in 2013.”

752,"Playmatics Raises $1 Million To Make Reality-Based, Social Games",https://techcrunch.com/2011/04/21/playmatics-angel-round-1-million/,2011/04/21," Social and mobile gaming startup Playmatics attained a $1 million investment from several Swiss-based angel investors to develop a  “real world game” franchise called Shadow Government the company revealed today. Initially a Facebook platform game, Shadow Government will use economic and sustainability data, and government-modeling software from the Millennium Institute to give players a chance to build and run, or destroy their own virtual countries.
The Millennium Institute is best known as the creator of Threshold 21 (T21) and other government modeling software, research and algorithms. Its tools are used by policy-makers and development organizations to test and plan responses for a range of real-world events. The Millennium Institute’s overall mission is to “empower people and governments to build societies that are peaceful, equitable and sustainable,” according to their website.
Dr. Hans Herren, president of The Millennium Institute — also a fan of SimCity, SimAnt and A-Train — wrote about his organizations’ goals through the media of games, via an email interview with TechCrunch:


Since joining the Millennium Institute, I thought [we could] drive high-quality, fun and educational games with a twofold objective: teach players…about the inter-connectivity of everything around them; and harness global intelligence and wisdom to help build a better world.
Our models are all developed with a System Dynamics paradigm. They allow for the integration of the environment, society and economy into a single interactive and dynamic framework, [which] is unique in allowing inter-connectivity to play out synergies while highlighting unintended consequences so often ignored in policy decisions.
If “real world games” can reach the youth of today, and the leaders of tomorrow, and encourage them to think in this manner about issues, and design realistic solutions, we will have gone a long way in transitioning towards sustainability.
[Shadow Government] will also raise awareness about the services that Millennium Institute offers to governments, the private sector and civil society as well as individuals to better inform their green and fair growth policies and responsible behavior.


Millennium Institute wants the Shadow Government games to be incorporated into curriculum from primary schools through universities. Chief executive of Playmatics, [and of the spin-out startup, Shadow Government] Margaret Wallace noted that the game should be entertaining above all, though it is also educational. She explained:


We see Shadow Government advancing a future genre in gaming. It’s not a ‘serious game,’ really, because we aim to design an entertainment experience. People can use Shadow Government to destroy their own little country, or to wreak havoc where they can. We won’t impose ideas like you have to clean up the environment to advance a level. We want to see an array of behavior and ideas.
We will be able to incorporate real world news and data, sometimes in real-time. We could take a different world-focus [with the game content] depending on what is going on in the world, asking players to create scenarios around the crisis in Japan, or the conflict in Libya, for example.
Seeing how people play, in aggregate, will be one way of crowd sourcing ideas to help or predict systemic issues.

Playmatics was co-founded by game industry veterans Margaret Wallace, Nick Fortugno and Phillipe Trawinka. The company, which currently has 15 full time employees, has designed social and mobile games for the AMC television show Breaking Bad, and more recently for the New York Public Library (with Jane McGonigal).

753,A Wind Farm In Oregon Draws $100 Million Investment From Google's Treasury,https://techcrunch.com/2011/04/18/google-wind-investment-oregon/,2011/04/18,"Google Inc.’s putting another $100 million into large-scale, renewable energy projects. The company’s director of green business operations, Rick Needham, revealed Monday in a post to the corporate blog:
[Google] invested approximately $100 million in the Shepherds Flat Wind Farm…currently under construction near windy Arlington, Ore. When completed in 2012 [the plant] will produce 845 MW of energy. This will be the first commercial wind farm in the U.S. to deploy, at scale, turbines that use permanent magnet generators…The electricity produced at Shepherds Flat will be sold under long-term agreements to Southern California Edison.

Prior to financing the Oregon wind farm, Google Inc. invested $168 million in the Mojave-based, Ivanpah solar power tower plant, another renewable energy project that inked a power purchase agreement with Southern California Edison. The Ivanpah solar plant is expected, upon completion in 2013, to generate 392 gross megawatts of energy.
As with their investment in Ivanpah, a Google spokesperson said the company would not be purchasing energy directly from the Shepherds Flat wind farm but would become part owners through its investment. The money for the investment comes from the Google Inc. treasury, or cash holdings.
Besides Google, GE also previously invested in the Shepherds Flat wind farm. GE serves as a supplier of turbines, as well as operations and maintenance services, there. Caithness Energy is the developer of the massive, Oregon renewable energy facility. Co-investors with Google in the wind farm included Sumitomo Corporation of America, and Tyr Energy.

754,Cleantech Investor Raj Alturu Moves From DFJ To Silver Lake Kraftwerk,https://techcrunch.com/2011/04/15/alturu-leaving-dfj-for-silverlake/,2011/04/15," On Thursday, Raj Atluru announced that he was stepping down as a managing director with Draper Fisher Jurvetson, where he served as a key cleantech investor since 2001. He will join a private equity group that invests in later-stage clean energy companies, Silver Lake Kraftwerk, which was formed earlier in 2011 by Silver Lake Partners and Soros Fund Management, led by Adam Grosser.
Atluru took board positions at six of DFJ’s cleantech portfolio companies and will maintain seats on some of these, according to a managing director at DFJ in Menlo Park, Josh Stein. He also noted:

“Silver Lake Kraftwerk addresses something of a gap in cleantech investing. Our cleantech investments at DFJ are generally early stage, say two to ten million series A to C rounds. When these companies start to scale they need big checks, on the order of fifty to $100 million, to sustain them. Raj will be on a very short list of people we call when some of our portfolio cleantech companies reach that point.
We’re not likely to fund a billion dollar plant. We will continue to do a broad range of cleantech deals but at that earlier stage. It is good to have another platform out there that can write those big checks, led by someone we know and who knows our portfolio. I am certain we will do deals together.”


Six of DFJ’s ten managing directors (not including Alturu) invest in cleantech companies also, and the fund did not make any major changes to personnel or its investment strategy as a result of Atluru’s move. DFJ’s cleantech investments include about 40 portfolio companies today, and a range of well-known brands in clean energy and consumer green technology: Good Guide, EnerNOC, Solar Junction, Tesla, BrightSource and Solar City among them.

755,Ioxus Raises $21 Million For Improved Power Storage Technology,https://techcrunch.com/2011/04/14/ioxus-21-million-energystorage/,2011/04/14,"A New York-based clean tech startup, Ioxus, raised $21 million in a round from Energy Technology Ventures (a GE-NRG Energy-ConocoPhillips joint fund), Northwater Capital, Aster Capital and their previous backers Braemar Energy Ventures, the companies announced today.
Ioxus makes lithium-ion hybrid capacitors, and ultracapacitors, which are (often alongside other battery technology) used to charge and run: wind turbines, light rail and other public transportation systems, hybrid and electric vehicles, medical equipment, LED lighting, power tools and other consumer electronics.
Chief executive officer of Ioxus, Mark McGough, said that the funds would go towards the development and manufacture of ultracapacitors that can generate more power, store more energy and work with higher device operating voltages than those offered today. In particular, the CEO wrote in an email to TechCrunch:
“[The company] will continue to work on [developing ultracapacitors] with higher power density that maintain higher energy density with a wide temperature range. We will be coming out with a new generation of ultracapacitor cells later this quarter with a concentration on these features.”
As Inhabitat blogger Timon Singh has noted:
“[The latest Ioxus hybrid capacitor] has huge potential. It could lead to hybrid [vehicles] being fully charged in mere minutes and improve the life cycles of electric vehicles. Currently, vehicle braking systems demand recharging hundreds of thousands of times, but that would not be the case with a lithium-ion ultracapacitor.”
Ioxus has been experiencing growth in sales in Asia, aided by partnerships with wind power technology distributors GTAE and Mouser Electronics, and the increasing popularity of hybrid transportation in China.In the U.S. market, the company has been selling more ultracapacitors to the makers of consumer electronics industry, especially LED lighting.
Companies like Sinautec also sell ultracapacitors in China. Meanwhile, ARPA-E (Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy) in the U.S. is funding a number of companies and labs developing energy storage technologies, especially capacitors, that can improve electric vehicles and public transportation.

756,"For The Electric Vehicles Market, Small Batteries Mean Big Sales",https://techcrunch.com/2011/04/13/for-the-electric-vehicles-market-small-batteries-mean-big-sales/,2011/04/13," For the electric vehicle market, it looks like small is the new big, especially when it comes to batteries. According to a new study by Lux Research, the market forecast for energy storage devices for electronic vehicles is bright. Lux sees the sector’s overall growth rising from $13 billion in 2011 to $30 billion by 2016 — a compound annual growth rate of 18 percent.
And what will cause this prodigious (and steady) growth spurt? Well, in spite of the current popularity (in headlines, at least) of plug-ins like the Chevy Volt and the Nissan Leaf, Lux sees big returns in small vehicles. The bulk of growth, the study says, will be driven by “more humble” vehicles, like e-bikes and micro-hybrids.
It also seems that, while many expected battery prices across all-electric and hybrid cars to drop, the decline has been more measured than anticipated. Prices have not yet reached that magic number that would begin to encourage true widespread adoption. As a result, small vehicles will step in to fill the gap, as will the batteries that power them.
For example: Replacement batteries for the currently deployed eBike base, especially in China where eBikes are thriving, plus growth in new sales, will drive the eBike market from $12 billion in 2011 to $24.3 billion in 2016, Lux says. And, as the eBike market transitions from lead acid batteries to lithium-ion technology, demand for lead acid-based storage technology will diminish, as will its lead in the market.
The other significant factor in market growth will be micro-hybrids, which offer an attractive, low-risk way for automakers to improve fuel efficiencies. Because micro-hybrids use regenerative braking applications to improve fuel efficiency, they do not require as much energy storage as their all-electric or hybrid counterparts.
Micros are also much less expensive for automakers to retrofit and don’t have nearly the same amount of battery costs as their bigger cousins. As this is such, Lux sees micro-hybrids eclipsing other passenger vehicles in terms of both storage and dollars, growing from 5.1 GWh and $495 million in 2011 to 41 GWh and $3.1 billion by 2016.
So, there you have it. The future is mini. Small electric vehicles will drive battery sales, and eBikes and micro-hybrids will be the ones to capitalize.

757,Power Assure's Software To Make Cisco Blade Servers More Energy Efficient,https://techcrunch.com/2011/04/12/powerassure-cisco-server-compatibility/,2011/04/12,"  At the Intel Developer Forum in Beijing today, Power Assure — a green IT business from Santa Clara, Calif. — revealed that its energy management software is now compatible with Cisco’s Unified Computing System (UCS) Blade servers.
According to Jed Scaramella, a research manager for servers at IDC, here’s how fast blade servers, in general, are gaining traction in the market:

In 2010, the server blade market in the U.S. was $2.7 billion, representing approximately 14 percent of the U.S. server market… [IDC] expects the blade segment to grow 19.8 percent in 2011 to $3.2 billion in the U.S – compared to the total U.S. server growth of 2.4 percent.
On a worldwide level, the blade market is expected to grow 22.4 percent in revenue over the next year to $7.3 billion, which is relative to total server worldwide revenue growth of 3.5 percent.
Growth in blades is driven by customers’ need to deliver a more flexible IT infrastructure; blades can simplify management and create an agile environment that is better able to respond to the changing needs of a business.


By design, blade servers (including Cisco’s) are supposed to use less energy, and take up less space than their predecessors. Still, Power Assure — and competitors like SynapSense — have designed software to make them even less power-consuming, and hopefully more affordable and longer-lasting, for data center owners and operators.
According to a post on Cisco’s corporate website, in September 2010 the company’s chief financial officer Frank Calderoni said that the company was seeing 82 percent growth for its UCS product line on a quarter over quarter basis. (Neither IDC nor Cisco offered specific market share data on these servers in time for publication.)
In general, Power Assure — whose investors include Good Energies, Point Judith Capital and Draper Fisher Jurvetson — claims its solutions cut ongoing power consumption for IT organizations by an average of 50 percent.
Computers and data centers in the U.S., in recent years, have only used a few percentage points of all electricity consumed in the country, but that number is on the rise along with the cost of electricity generation from traditional power sources.

758,"Digital Lumens Closes $10 Million To Bring Smart, LED-Lighting To The Industrial Market",https://techcrunch.com/2011/04/12/digital-lumens-series-b-10-million/,2011/04/12," A Boston-based, cleantech startup Digital Lumens closed a $10 million series B investment, the company announced today, that will allow it to bring its LED-based, intelligent lighting systems to warehouses and industrial facilities in the U.S., Canada and Mexico near term. The company’s earlier backers all participated in the series B, including: Black Coral Capital, Flybridge Capital Partners, and Stata Venture Partners.
Previously, the company focused on making warehouses greener in terms of lighting-related energy consumption. Digital Lumens’ chief executive, Tom Pincince, said of the company’s progress and near term strategy:


We’ve built a complete [lighting] solution from the fixture through the networking and the software. Our customers use, but don’t “do” lighting, unlike other the owners and operators of some commercial office buildings. It is valuable for them to have a single point of contact, and technology that guarantees interoperability within their facilities as they upgrade and retrofit their lighting systems to become more energy efficient.
Part of our appetite for growth is not just from warehouses to the broader manufacturing and industrial base here, but outside of the U.S. We can address Canada and Mexico. We’re also looking into expanding overseas to address European and Asian markets that have similar requirements for energy efficiency, and in many cases, a culture of efficiency that’s far more mature than the U.S. along with energy prices that are multiples of what we pay here.


Digital Lumens will also use some of its series B funding to develop new features for its LightRules software. LightRules helps facility owners and operators set up parameters by which they want their lights to respond to a number of factors, like brightening when the number of people in a facility increases, for example, or dousing at times of low occupancy. LightRules, down the line, will offer more granular controls, automating the lights’ response to energy pricing, and more.
One of Digital Lumens’ recent customers, Americold, replaced its older lighting systems— which used more energy, generate more heat, and aren’t as durable in the freezing temperatures of cold storage warehouses— with LED-based systems. The companies, and LEDs Magazine reported, that the installation was responsible for energy savings of 90 percent.
Mike Rubino, Digital Lumens chief financial officer remarked that working with the company’s earlier backers allowed everyone at the startup to get back to growing the business. Rubino is well-known for helping to take another cleantech firm, A123 systems public. While he could not comment on timing, he and the executive team at Digital Lumens do have hopes of an eventual public offering in the U.S.
As Digital Lumens focuses on greening factories and warehouses, and international expansion, a peer and competitor in the industry Redwood Systems, yesterday revealed that it is moving into smart building controls beyond lighting as part of its strategy.

759,BrightSource Nabs $168 Million From Google To Develop Ivanpah Solar Power Plant In The Mojave,https://techcrunch.com/2011/04/11/brightsource-ivanpah-168-million-goog/,2011/04/11," Developers of large-scale, solar power plants BrightSource Energy Inc. closed another $168 million investment, the company announced today — this time from Google corporate. The funds will go towards the completion of the humongous, Ivanpah solar power tower plant in the Mojave Desert now under construction (image, right).
Three years ago, Google.org invested $10 million, and took an equity stake in BrightSource. This deal hailed from Google’s Green Business Operations team, however, and the funds are to be applied towards the completion of the Ivanpah project not Brightsource’s overall business, a Google spokesman confirmed.
Google’s director of Green Business Operations, Rick Needham, wrote more about the company’s reasons for investing in this project in an official company blog post today. He expressed hope that moving a solar project of this magnitude forward in Nevada, that could supply power to California, would reduce the cost of clean energy from renewable sources for Google, and the market overall. Google still buys most of its power from the grid.
According to the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System (ISEGS) is expected to be operational for 25 years after completion around 2013, and is expected to generate 392 gross megawatts of solar energy.
BrightSource attained power purchase agreements with major utilities, including Southern California Edison which helped it secure financing for Ivanpah.
Conservation and Native American groups have recently filed lawsuits against BrightSource, expressing concern over the company’s environmental impact to the Mojave, especially endangered tortoises and delicate habitat there.
At least Google’s not — or are they — investing in nuclear. BrightSource’s website notes that Ivanpah, when completed, is expected to almost double the amount of solar thermal electricity produced in the U.S. today.

760,Number Of U.S. Companies With Green Programs Increased 54 Percent In 2010,https://techcrunch.com/2011/04/11/2010-green-workplaces-survey/,2011/04/11," The number of American businesses with formal green programs in place increased 54 percent last year according to new research from Buck Consultants (a subsidiary of Xerox). Of about 120 businesses surveyed — including hardware and other technology firms, government offices, consultancies, non-profits, hospitals, and the makers of consumer packaged goods — 69 percent said they took deliberate measures to improve their environmental and social impact in 2010.
What motivated companies to go green, officially?
Fifty-eight percent said they started their programs to create “community goodwill,” and 46 percent said they did so to improve stakeholder perception of their business. During the recession, however, 78 percent of companies with green programs came to view cost savings as the top, desired return on investment.
Over 90 percent of companies realized cost savings as a direct result of their green programs: 78 percent of them saved on electricity, 68 percent on heating and cooling, 68 percent on paper, and 60 percent saved on water. About 9 percent of companies with formal green programs said they failed to save money thanks to their initiatives in 2010.
Spending may have exceeded savings in some cases; big-ticket items like electric vehicles for company fleets, or the installation of solar canopies and rooftops, and building-wide, networked lighting systems that use sensors and LEDs (light emitting diodes) can cost a company in the short-term, for example, but lead to savings on fuel or electricity over the longer term.

More than half of the companies surveyed used renewable energy in their buildings in 2010. Twenty five percent of buildings occupied by companies with green programs in place were powered by solar, 15 percent by wind, 12 percent by geothermal, another 12 percent by hydropower, 11 percent by biomass and 11 percent by “other” undefined sources of renewable energy.
Startups and innovators are likely to see opportunity, rather than a lack of progress, where businesses — and building owners— have failed to embrace clean technology and better habits, so far. Still, it’s hard to imagine how any American employer in the year of the BP Oil Spill failed to implement a formal green program. Amazingly, 31 percent of companies surveyed did not heed the call.
The slackers had their excuses. 
Sixty-five percent of surveyed companies without a formal green program noted that it simply wasn’t an organizational priority to have one. Forty-one percent said they didn’t have enough manpower to implement green initiatives. Thirty-two percent assumed it would cost too much (despite the savings realized by a majority of businesses with green programs). Eighteen percent asked, if there wasn’t a legal requirement in place, why bother? [Ed’s note: paraphrasing]
Looking ahead, of all the companies surveyed 66 percent had no plans to reimburse employees for hybrid or clean vehicles within the next year or soon thereafter, 36 percent weren’t planning to give employees time off for environment related community service, and 40 percent weren’t considering socially responsible pension investment options.
Instead, companies planned to implement the following green programs, either within the next twelve months or after one year: green training for employees (19 percent) or for executives and leadership (16 percent); green procurement training (30 percent); and online HR communications (16 percent).

One new feature of the company’s ChargePoint network allows Coulomb’s charging stations to accept payments via MIFARE transportation cards, a fare collection system used widely by electric vehicle drivers, station owners, municipalities and utilities in Europe.
Additionally, Coulomb’s ChargePoint CT2500 (the model 3, type 2) charging station also obtained European safety certifications that verify its compatibility with the Nissan LEAF. The hotly anticipated electric vehicle is due soon on roads in Portugal, Ireland, the UK and The Netherlands, according to a Coulomb press statement.
Coulomb’s products compete with Nissan LEAF compatible charging stations in production or promised by GE (NYSE: GE), Park Pod, EV-Charge America and Aerovironment.
Although the Obama Administration did set a goal to put one million plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles on the road by 2015, export opportunities in Europe may prove a big growth driver for clean tech companies like Coulomb.
European regulators have, compared to their counterparts in the United States, more aggressively created standards, financial incentives and strategies around the uptake of clean and energy-efficient vehicles, for example, the European Green Cars Initiative.

763,Agilyx Raises $22 Million To Turn Plastics (Back) Into Oil,https://techcrunch.com/2011/04/01/agilyx-22-million-seriesb/,2011/04/01," A Portland area startup selling patented systems that turn plastic trash into synthetic crude oil, Agilyx, closed a $22 million series B round, the company revealed on Thursday. The systems (image below) look like the kind of equipment you’d see in a brewery.
Here’s how they work, according to the company website:


Plastic feedstock, a mix of everything from grocery bags to vehicle dashboards and computer monitor cases, are dropped by a crane into a sizable vessel, where they are indirectly heated until they turn into a liquid, and then a gas.
With a series of controlled pressure and temperature adjustments, the gases are pulled through pipes into a central, condensing chamber.
There, the gases cool off, and contaminants are siphoned away. The synthetic crude oil that remains is transferred into a tank. The company can transport these tanks full of synthetic crude, and sell it to oil refineries that make it into heating oil, diesel or gas and more. 


The company’s chief executive, Chris Ulum, told TechCrunch that Agilyx sells the crude it generates, through off take deals with large refineries, on behalf of those who install their systems. His was the first company to strike this type of deal, he claims. (off take agreements are reminiscent of power purchase agreements that wind and solar industry players strike with large-scale utilities.) The company also helps prospective buyers to finance their systems.
Investors in the series B round for Agilyx included: Chrysalix Energy Venture Capital, the company’s original backers, and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (KPCB) which led the round, along with Waste Management (NYSE: WM) and the investment affiliate of the global oil and gas company, Total S.A. (NYSE: TOT).
A senior vice president with Chrysalix, Brian Wawro, said Agilyx gave him tremendous hope, not just for a successful initial public offering, hopefully by the end of 2012, but also for a solution to burgeoning problems affiliated with plastic and e-waste, globally. He noted:


“Agilyx solves a huge problems on the waste side, and on the energy side.
We have all these plastics that don’t see a high rate of recycling, things like grocery plastics, shopping bags, dry cleaning bags, e-waste, auto shredder residual like dashboards and wiring from a crushed vehicle, and they’re in a single waste stream, most of the time. What you do with that? To dispose of contaminated [and mixed] plastics, now, costs about $400 or $500 a ton, to go to landfill.
Agilyx has a far more economic solution which is to not just dispose of this, but create a valuable end-use product from it — oil that is widely refinable. That’s a very attractive use of waste to everyone from municipalities, to plastic aggregators…
We’ve also talked about the possibilities of using the Agilyx system in some form — putting it on a barge — to deal with things like the Pacific Trash Vortex.” 

Several major plastic gyres, or floating, gigantic masses of plastic— one in the Pacific is twice the size of Texas, according to National Geographic — pollute the ocean today.
The gyres, and plastic waste generally in the ocean harms wildlife in several ways. Animals may eat plastic particles, and can die from resulting digestive problems; they may get injuriously tangled in plastic waste; and they suffer from exposure to chemicals released by plastic waste that’s biodegraded in the water, namely BPA (bisphenol A) which disrupts their endocrine systems and negatively effects reproduction.
According to Project Kaisei, an environmental non-profit dedicated to raising awareness about waste in the ocean: “every year, over 300 million tons of plastic are produced, much of it for one-time, disposable use, and roughly 90% never makes it to be recycled.”
So far, all of Agilyx installations have been terrestrial. On land, the company faces a challenge in scaling to the mass market— it must obtain permits, state-by-state in the U.S., proving air emissions from its processes are safe. Agilyx obtained its first such permits in Oregon. Ulum said his company has four pending projects in California, and he expects at least the largest of these to be permitted soon, and operating in full by the end of 2011.
Other plastics waste to energy companies — like Polymer Energy, LLC in Minnesota, or Envion in Washington D.C. — face the same regulatory scrutiny.
Plastics to fuel companies also compete with, when they’re not supplementing the work of, more traditional recyclers, incinerators and land fill businesses, as well as companies that tout the benefits of plant-based plastics, which are not as easily processed and converted back into synthetic crude.

Converteam’s senior management will retain the remaining stake in the company, but GE has agreed to purchase their shares over the next two to five years for a price that it expects not to exceed $480 million.
Converteam was previously owned by a shareholder group that includes the company’s management, Barclays Private Equity and LBO France. To learn more about the company’s history, check out its Wikipedia profile.
The transaction is expected to close during third quarter 2011, subject to customary closing conditions.
Converteam’s solutions enable its clients to replace or improve mechanical processes with high-efficiency electric alternatives that deliver better reliability, less maintenance and lower emissions. The company’s portfolio includes drives and other power electronics, advanced rotating machines, generators and controls.
Converteam operates across six key vertical sectors: offshore and onshore oil and gas, power generation, wind and solar renewables, industrial, marine and services.
Headquartered in Massy, France, Converteam has 5,300 employees, including more than 1,600 engineers, and operates in more than 80 countries.
Converteam recently announced 2010 sales of approximately $1.5 billion and EBITDA of approximately $239 million, with approximately 36 percent growth in orders versus 2009.
With the addition of the company, GE Energy’s goal is to bring new integrated product offerings to existing customers and apply its technology to new applications in a broad range of industrial verticals. The business expects to realize approximately $250 million in annual operating synergies by year five.
In the last six months, GE Energy has announced the acquisition of Dresser, Wellstream Holdings, Lineage Power Holdings and Well Support.

765,"Nuclear WatchDawg App Reveals Nuclear Plants, Safety Issues Within Fifty Mile Radius",https://techcrunch.com/2011/03/25/nuclearwatchdawg-app-launch/,2011/03/25," A newly released Android app, Nuclear WatchDawg, reveals where nuclear power plants and associated safety and environmental concerns are within a fifty mile radius anywhere in the U.S.
NuclearWatchDawg aggregates data from some 30 sources, mostly government and academic research labs whose research is in the public domain. Lee Guthman, who develops new apps and ventures for the GVW Group in Highland Park, Illinois noted:
“We developed this app because there is heightened interest in nuclear power following the earthquake in Japan, and damages to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant there. In the U.S., people want to know what they’re living or working nearby, how big these nuclear facilities are, and what are the known issues around them, if any.”

According to a report today by Steve Herman for VOA News:

“Since the March 11 magnitude 9.0 earthquake and resulting tsunami, high radiation levels, fires and explosions at some of [Japan’s] six [effected nuclear] reactors have slowed efforts to make critical repairs to stabilize the situation.
Japanese government agencies say they are considering raising the assessment of the nuclear crisis to a level six or ‘serious accident’ on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale. Currently, the Fukushima accident is rated a level five, which is considered to ‘have wider consequences.'”


Emission of radioactive vapor from one complex led to warnings about Japan’s water supply, and raised safety concerns and international scrutiny of Japanese vegetables, milk and seafood, and possibly other exports. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced it is blocking imports from the region in Japan where the nuclear accident occurred, for example. The crisis has forced farmers to destroy crops there, NPR reported.
[Ed’s note: TechCrunch’s Jon Evans published a story suggesting mainstream media’s coverage of the nuclear situation in Japan is tantamount to “hysteria,” but offered a guide to sites he trusted instead. It’s worth checking out the links he’s provided to independent media sources that he trusts for technically accurate perspectives.]

The Nuclear Watchdawg app is meant for those who are curious about the impacts of nuclear power near where they live and work in the U.S., or who might be buying or selling a home, or moving a business nearby. Like GVW’s other sites and apps, Nuclear Watchdawg is ad-supported (via AdMob) but free to get and use.
Guthman said his firm will likely develop other, GPS-enabled Watchdawg apps based on consumers’ major environmental and safety concerns. For the next release of Nuclear Watchdawg app (due out before the end of May) his team plans to include alert features to let users know when there is a new development, or problem at a nuclear facility in their area, and direct them as to recommended safety measures.
On a much lighter note, the firm previously developed the virtual vuvuzela app, released during the last World Cup Soccer tournament, attaining 1 million downloads within thirty days, with 29 percent of the downloads from the U.S. and 14 percent in Japan.
GVW Group in Highland Park, Illinois is a non-traditional investment group (or diversified holding company) that develops apps and websites, then spins out and funds new startups around those that have made a strong impact within a niche, or proven very popular. The company also makes clean tech and energy investments, and is a primary stakeholder of Autocar, LLC a maker of garbage trucks that run on natural gas, and iClunkIt the company behind GreenOhm.com, a site and service matching consumers to rebates and incentives for energy-efficient appliances, and home energy systems.

766,"CMP.LY Raises $750,000 To Keep Companies Honest Online",https://techcrunch.com/2011/03/23/cmply-raises-750k-seed-round/,2011/03/23," More and more businesses are using social media — from Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn, to Tumblr and Foursquare, more recently — to manage customer relationships, market, sell or even directly conduct their business transactions. With the maturation of the technology and business practices comes regulation from government agencies including the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FNRA) in the U.S. and the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) in the U.K.
A New York City startup, CMP.LY (pronounced “comply”) today announced that it has raised a $750,000 seed round to provide web-based software and services that help companies play by the new rules. CMP.LY’s backers included: Safir Capital, Angel Street Capital, Austin-based investor and serial entrepreneur Joshua Baer, and undisclosed angels who the company connected with, in part, through AngelList.
CMP.LY’s technology monitors and documents a company’s social media interactions, and automatically publishes required disclosures within status updates and blog posts. It also provides short URLs to include in tweets. The disclosures take the form of either a short URL, or an icon (CMP.LY calls it a “badge,” image below) that link to a company’s detailed disclosure.
Tom Chernaik, CMP.LY founder and chief executive, expects the technology to help any business that does significant outreach to bloggers and social media influencers to solicit reviews, brand mentions and more. It could also help: media professionals who have obtained samples, sponsorships or ad support from a business to be transparent about the ways their content, advice or reviews may have been influenced; and businesses that make health and environmental claims about their products, to ensure that consumers understand the technical limits inherent in those claims (Claims like “organic,” “low-calorie” or “carbon netural” may need more explanation than “gluten free,” of course.)

The fact that CMP.LY enticed 1,000 registered, active users, including twenty pilot customers representing major, national American brands in consumer packaged goods, and traditional retail (like  JCPenney) helped the company lock in the seed round, Chernaik said.
Financial professionals, especially, have been skittish about using social media.  As  Jim Pavia reported for InvestmentNews this week, financial firms have been hesitant to use social media, with the threat of legal and financial troubles that could result from a regulatory violation:


“Preliminary research from the 2011 InvestmentNews RIA Technology Study found that 49% of 107 [investment] firms surveyed said that social networking is an important part of their business development efforts…
[At the same time…] just 35% of financial advisory firms are using social media, compared with 85% for other businesses.”

CMP.LY could collaborate with, or face competition from large tech consultancies that offer compliance solutions to different industries, but also from startups like linkedFA, which scored $3 million in a series A round, the firm announced yesterday, for a social network that has compliance tools baked into their web offering, a social network for insurance and finance professionals.

767,IBM Buys Real Estate And Facilities Management Software Company Tririga,https://techcrunch.com/2011/03/22/ibm-buys-real-estate-and-facilities-management-software-company-tririga/,2011/03/22,"IBM is making its first purchase of 2011 today with acquisition of real estate management software developer Tririga. Financial terms of the deal, which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2011, were not disclosed.
Tririga’s software helps clients make strategic planning decisions regarding space usage, evaluate alternative real estate initiatives, generate higher returns from capital projects, and assess environmental impact investments. IBM says that property and real estate typically represents the second-largest expense on a company’s income statement, after employee compensation.  Tririga’s software helps companies streamlines and cut these expenses.
Tririga’s software is used by more than 200 clients, including over one-third of Fortune 100 corporations as well as seven of the 15 federal executive departments of the U.S. government.
Tririga will be integrated into IBM Tivoli Software and IBM Global Business Services.
In 2010, IBM spent roughly $6 billion to acquire 17 companies, so it should be interesting to see what acquisition’s are up Big Blue’s sleeve in 2011.

768,"1BOG Motivates Homeowners In Philly To Go Solar, Groupon-Style",https://techcrunch.com/2011/03/21/1bog-motivates-homeowners-in-philly-to-go-solar-groupon-style/,2011/03/21," One Block Off The Grid (1BOG) is motivating homeowners to go solar by arranging and promoting group discounts for panels and installation services, especially in areas of the U.S. where the cost of electricity from traditional energy sources is on the rise.
In its latest such deal, 1BOG arranged a 15 percent discount via panel manufacturers Canadian Solar (NASDAQ: CISQ) and East Coast installers, Mercury Solar Systems, for homeowners in Philadelphia.
The deal with Canadian Solar represents a new, major partnership for 1BOG. Incorporated in 2001, Canadian Solar is a large panel producer that raked in net revenue of $452.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, up about 44 percent from the same period in 2009 (when net revenue was $254.2 million).
Backed by early investors in Groupon, New Enterprise Associates, 1BOG draws frequent comparisons to the daily deal site.  Unlike Groupon, however, 1BOG reviews and endorses all of the equipment and services that it helps to sell; and its discounts are free. (You don’t have to buy the coupon you want to use, just sign up for it.)
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index over the last two months (Jan. 17, through Mar. 17, 2011) prices for electricity rose three percent for greater Philadelphia.

A company representative confirmed that 1BOG looks carefully at electricity pricing trends before developing deals. Where electricity remains cheapest, like in the southwestern U.S., it hasn’t gone fully to market, though environmental benefits of solar over old, if affordable, coal power systems there would be significant.
The discounts on panels and services from 1BOG are separate from attainable discounts from states and federal rebate programs for solar installations by homeowners. The 1BOG site offers users information on those, along with their own discounts.
As government budget hawks cut back feed-in-tariff, subsidy and rebate programs in the U.S. homeowners may increasingly rely on corporate discounts and deal sites like 1BOG to make their power installations more affordable. Wind and solar subsidies, of late, have been drying up in Europe. The fate of such programs in the U.S. is to be determined.
Residential solar installations in the U.S. only represented about 30 percent of all new solar installations here in 2010, according to a recent report from the Solar Energy Industry Association. They were a lagging market segment, as solar overall was on the rise in the U.S. with the industry’s total market value growing 67 percent from $3.6 billion in 2009 to $6.0 billion in 2010, according to the same report.

769,VIA Motors Raises $5.3 Million To Build Clean Trucks And SUVs,https://techcrunch.com/2011/03/18/via-motors-raises-5-3-million-to-build-clean-trucks-and-suvs/,2011/03/18," According to a Friday SEC filing, VIA Motors closed a $5.3 million series A investment in a deal that involved 44 angel, and friends-and-family investors. The filing reflects the potential for the company to take about an additional $5 million [for a total target of $10 million]. Carl E. Berg, a serial real estate entrepreneur and investor in electric vehicle technology, participated in the new round, and remains VIA Motors’ principal investor.
The company will use its new-found capital to take their electric range extended vehicles (E-REVs), namely trucks and sport utility vehicles, through a beta production phase and then to mass market production levels by 2013 said Richard Clayton, VIA’s chief financial officer on Friday.
VIA Motors’ E-REV trucks and SUVs have already been purchased by fleets at large, pilot customers, including PG&E. VIA will make these in greater numbers, relying on outsourced manufacturing partners through 2013, Clayton said. After that, VIA Motors is likely to invest in factories to assemble their own E-REV vehicles he confirmed. The company spun out from a the publicly traded company, Raser Technologies, in 2010.

Today, VIA Motors acquires “fully contented vehicles” from original auto makers, then converts them into E-REVs by taking out the engine, transmission and components of the drive train, and replacing them with non-combustion technology.
VIA Motors’ batteries can last for forty miles, at which point their fuel-powered generator — which runs on gasoline, but in the future could be built to run on biofuels or hydrogen fuel cells — takes over. The generator serves to charge the battery. The idea is that drivers won’t feel “range anxiety,” like they might in an all electric vehicle without the auxiliary power.
Among others, VIA is converting Chevrolet Silverados, and in the past converted iconic gas guzzler brand Hummer H3 vehicles into E-REVs. The company’s technology differs from that found in most hybrid, plug-in electric vehicles (HPEVs) on the market today, like the Prius or the Leaf. To the general consumer, however, VIA’s trucks and SUVs feel like hybrids.
The company faces potential competition from the likes of Smith Electric Vehicles, a provider of electric trucks and vehicles to the Marine Corps, and several fleets for consumer packaged goods brands.
It could be seen as an acquisition target, or competition to the very original equipment makers from which it buys contented vehicles today, especially if those auto companies choose to develop their own electric range-extended systems and brands. VIA touts its vehicles as clean alternatives to traditional trucks and SUVs, that feel just as good as those traditional models.

Based in Camarillo, Calif. CoolPlanet claims its biofuel products are not just net zero, but “negative carbon fuels,” because the byproducts from making and using them can sequester carbon, and therefore act as a soil conditioner. Converting cellulosic plant material into gasoline could help the agricultural sector by creating demand for non-food crops, and potentially new jobs in rural farming communities.
The investment represents Google Ventures’ first foray into biofuels. CoolPlanet was previously backed by North Bridge Venture Partners, and GE Energy Financial Services in an $8 million series B round. Google Ventures did not disclose the amount it invested into the round.
(Company representatives did not respond to a TechCrunch query as to how much money went into their series B investment by the close of business on Thursday.)

771,Zero Motorcycles Raises Another $17 Million To Make More Electric Bikes Domestically,https://techcrunch.com/2011/03/17/zero-motorcycles-funding/,2011/03/17,"Zero Motorcycles in Santa Cruz, Calif. today revealed that Invus, LP, the company’s earliest financial backers, have invested another $17 million in the business, with potential to add $9 million more over coming months.
The capital will go towards expanding the Zero’s U.S. operations, primarily, and towards expanding the company’s global sales efforts, research and development, according to a company press statement. Invus, LP invested in Zero Motorcycles in April 2008 and has remained the company’s principal investor.
Zero’s DS motorcycles are highway legal and safe for off-road bike paths, but drive quietly thanks to an all-electric drivetrain, so they are viewed as advantageous for use by urban law enforcement. All of Zero’s bikes have lithium-ion batteries that are fully recyclable, and according to the company website:

“[The bikes] will produce less than one-eighth of the CO2 pollution per mile at the power plant than a gas-powered motorcycle. It will also produce 1/100th of the smog causing nitrous oxides.”

The company’s founder, Neal Saiki, recently announced he was leaving the company to pursue another clean tech and transportation breakthrough: the first successful flight of a human-powered helicopter via the The Igor Sikorsky Human Powered Helicopter Competition. The competition is run by the American Helicopter Society International with a $250,000 prize provided by Sikorsky Aircraft.

The London-based fund was started by Nobel prize winner Al Gore and the former CEO of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, David Blood. DAG Ventures and Keating Capital also invested alongside Harvest Power’s earlier backers Kleiner Perkins, Waste Management (NYSE: WM), Munich Venture Partners, and TriplePoint Capital.
According to Harvest Power’s chief executive Paul Sellew, the company will put the capital into building two of the “largest biomass renewable energy projects in North America, one in Richmond, B.C. and another outside of Toronto.” The demo facilities will help Harvest Power test and commercialize new technology to process organic waste and turn it into fertilizers and energy at a lower cost than anaerobic digesters that are currently available and widely used.
Current customers of Harvest Power are municipalities including Tulare County in California, and commercial and industrial producers of food waste, like the Canadian grocery chain, Loblaws. Sellew believes state laws making yard and food waste mandatory recyclables in the U.S. will drive additional business for the company, domestically.

The system was installed atop an inactive landfill.
According to a press statement from the Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Southwest: the installation should produce about 2,400 megawatt-hours (MWh) annually, or enough electricity to power 400 average U.S. homes.
The $9.4 million project is expected to save the Marine Corps at least $336,000 yearly in electricity costs, while tripling its previous solar energy capacity.
A Japanese company with significant operations in San Diego, Kyocera Solar, Inc. produced and supplied the photovoltaic modules for the system, domestically. Kyocera reported that 6,300 of its KD235 variety solar modules were used in the project, within some 225 panels.
San Diego-based integrator Synergy Electric Company installed the system in partnership with AEE Solar, a wholesale distributor of solar equipment and services. AECOM, an engineering and design firm, provided system designs.
According to 2010 research by Pew Environment Group, the U.S. Department of Defense has “set a goal of producing or procuring 25 percent of its electric energy needs from renewable sources by 2025… [and] incurs more than $1.3 billion in additional energy costs for every $10 increase per barrel rise in the world market price of oil.”

775,"Following Earthquake, Japanese Officials Fear Partial Nuclear Meltdown Underway",https://techcrunch.com/2011/03/13/japan-nuclear-earthquake/,2011/03/13," A massive earthquake that struck off Japan’s northeastern coast on Friday— taking 1,200 lives, with thousands still unaccounted for and ten thousand feared dead by police — also damaged multiple nuclear power plants there.
On Sunday, Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said a partial meltdown at the Fukushiman Dai-ichi nuclear complex, was likely under way. The partial meltdown follows a blast on Saturday at one unit of the complex, where operators are working to cool the reactor core by injecting seawater and boron into its containment vessel.
Also on Sunday, according to the International Atomic Energy Association Japan’s Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) reported a state of emergency at a another facility, the Onagawa nuclear power plant; while its three reactors remained under control, the emergency alert was related to radioactivity readings in the area that exceeded allowable levels.
Eric Talmadge and Mari Yamaguchi reported for the Associated Press:

“More than 170,000 people had been evacuated as a precaution… Edano said the radioactivity released into the environment so far was so small it didn’t pose any health threats. A complete meltdown — the collapse of a power plant’s systems and its ability to keep temperatures under control — could release uranium and dangerous contaminants into the environment and pose major, widespread health risks.”
While facing the terrifying prospect of multiple nuclear meltdowns in their country, millions of Japanese households remain without electricity, food and water currently.
The natural disasters could have caused even more damage if not for Japan’s investments in advanced warning systems, and constant updating of building codes to deal with earthquakes, especially.
Japan’s Meteorological Agency warned of strong aftershocks ahead; their website suggests a 70 percent chance of a magnitude 7-class earthquakes through March 16, 2011.
As oil prices are skyrocketing, generally, and energy demands are rising the United States’ energy chief, Steven Chu, recently asked Congress to consider an American clean energy standard that would include nuclear along with renewable sources like solar and wind. The situation in Japan, however, underscores controversy around designating nuclear as a clean energy source.

According to a press statement from the agency: Effective in September 2011, these products must be 40 percent more efficient than conventional models in order to win the Energy Star label.  Energy Star expects to update 20-some other product requirements this year.
Manufacturers of TVs, cable and satellite boxes in the U.S. don’t have to comply with the new Energy Star standards — unless they want their products to be eligible for rebates, like those highlighted by regional availability on GreenOhm.com and a number of government websites run by states with rebate programs.
Television manufacturers do have to label their sets with information about how much energy they consume annually, and how that compares to a range of similar models, under the Federal Trade Commission’s Appliance Labeling Rule that takes effect on May 10, 2011.
According to market research by In-Stat (recently acquired by The NPD Group), set-top box shipments in North America slowed in 2010, and the trend is likely to continue this year. The NPD Group reported, however, that 2011 holiday sales of television sets, in particular:

“The 46-47-inch flat-panel TV segment was the fastest-growing for the holiday, increasing 31 percent in units. Sales of TVs above 50 inches also showed strong growth with volume jumping 21 percent propelled by exciting new technologies such as 3D, Internet connectivity, and LED backlighting.”
The FTC is still considering energy-related labeling requirements for manufacturers of personal computers, cable or satellite set-top boxes, stand-alone digital video recorders, and personal computer monitors .

777,"Green Buildings Software Startup, Retroficiency, Closes $800,000 Seed Financing",https://techcrunch.com/2011/03/09/retroficiency-seed-round-800k/,2011/03/09," A Boston startup that makes energy auditing software for the commercial buildings industry, Retroficiency, raised $800,000 in a seed round led by energy management services firm World Energy Solutions (NASDAQ: XWES), and joined by a number of angel investors including Jean Hammond and Jill Preotle (both early investors in ZipCar) the companies announced today.
Facility managers, auditors or engineers who need to improve the energy efficiency of an aging building input whatever basic information they know about that building into Retroficiency’s system. The software uses the available details, and a comprehensive set of data about tens of thousands of other buildings with similar traits, then uses predictive analytics to generate an energy model for that building. (Retroficiency’s team has been compiling data on commercial buildings and energy efficiency since 2008.)
The site then generates, within hours, suggestions as to what kind of retrofit and renovation projects will have the biggest impact on a building from an energy and cost perspective. Chief executive officer and founder of Retroficiency, Bennett Fisher, offered this example of what the enterprise software can do:


“If you tell us you have fluorescent lights in a certain type of building, we can statistically infer that you have 526 fixtures with four 40-watt T12 lamps and magnetic ballasts. We can then suggest you upgrade to three 32-watt Super T8 lamps and electronic ballasts and show the relevant costs, savings, rebates, increases in ENERGY STAR ratings, decrease in Greenhouse Gas Emissions, etc.
Our optimization engine sorts through thousands of possible combinations like this over all of the building’s systems and builds packages that match the customer’s goal whether that is a specific reduction in energy, a payback period, or total spend limitations.  All of the inputs, inferences, etc are fully transparent so a user can go back and change/update any information.”


In pilot testing, Fisher said, the system’s building assessments were at least as accurate as reports done by on-foot inspectors at massive facilities. The company aims to make old-school physical audits obsolete, and instead give auditors a tool to make the whole process faster and easier. “Physical audits take weeks and several employees’ time, and are a bottleneck to advancing retrofit and energy efficiency projects,” Fisher noted.
The market opportunity for a company like Retroficiency is growing. MacGraw Hill Construction researchers predicted:

[By 2015] non-residential green building activity [will likely] triple, representing $120 billion to $145 billion in new construction (40%-48% of the non-residential market) and $14 billion to $18 billion in major retrofit and renovation projects.


Retroficiency’s early customers include facility management firms, which own and operate real estate, and ESCOs or energy service companies which are third-party providers who develop, install and arrange financing for projects to improve buildings’ energy efficiency, and lower maintenance costs over time.

(which will contribute about $5 million of that) to build a new, plastic bottle recycling facility in Lincolnshire, England. In recent weeks, the company also struck a landmark deal to sell its 30 percent plant-based plastic to Heinz, which will begin to use it in ketchup and condiments packaging in June.
Another major beverage player, SodaStream (nasdaq: SODA) announced today that it will soon ship its flavored syrups in bottles that can decompose in a landfill in five years. Regular plastic bottles take 450 years to decompose, according to general waste industry estimates.
SodaStream’s new “Bio Bottles” (image, below) are made using additives from Bio-Tec Environmental, LLC an Albuquerque, New Mexico company in a traditional bottle manufacturing process. The Bio Bottles were designed and will be manufactured by SodaStream. Bio-Tec’s EcoPure additives will be incorporated into the bottles, caps, and shrink-wrap rendering all components biodegradable in landfill or compost (or recyclable).

While recyclers, additives businesses, and non-petroleum plastic makers all offer landfill waste reduction benefits, it’s not clear how many more investments companies like Coke, Heinz and SodaStream will have to make before we see a reversal of some of the damages to our planet they already enabled.
According to the most recent available numbers provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in 2009 about 12.53 million tons of plastic containers and packaging (including bottles) ended up in US landfills.
Aside from other potentially harmful chemicals and impacts, most plastics used in food and beverage packaging have estrogenic-active compounds. In other words, most commonly available plastics have the “potential ability to interfere with the body’s endocrine system and produce adverse physiological effects,” according to research funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.

From the Google Mobile Blog:
“Starting today, our routing algorithms will also apply our knowledge of current and historical traffic to select the fastest route from those alternates. That means that Navigation will automatically guide you along the best route given the current traffic conditions.”
Previously Google Maps Navigation would take the “fastest” route and set up alternate routes like ones that use highways instead of side roads.  As of today all you have to do (aside from buy an Android phone) is open up the Navigation app. The app itself will use realtime traffic data crowd-sourced from users to try to get you there sooner. No guarantees.
The functionality is available in North America and Europe, where the realtime traffic condition data is currently available.

781,"PlugShare Helps Electric Vehicle Drivers Find Free, And Paid Charging Options",https://techcrunch.com/2011/03/07/plugshare-app-launch-xatori/,2011/03/07," A newly released app for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, called PlugShare aims to alleviate so-called “range anxiety” for electric vehicle drivers by giving them a map of an area’s available, paid charging stations and homes or lots that will allow them to plug in and recharge for free.
Xatori co-founder and chief executive Forrest North —who previously worked as an engineer at Tesla Motors, and founded and was CEO of Mission Motors, a company that makes electric motorcycles and their components— explained Xatori’s mission with PlugShare:
“We want to build and support a community that’s creating a paradigm shift to a massively cleaner type of transportation. The reality is that most people will charge their electric vehicles at home and not exceed the range of their vehicle very often. This [app] provides a kind of backup plan, and lets you feel comfortable. If you did miscalculate, you’d be ok.”

With oil and gas prices soaring, and with President Obama’s stated goal, from his January 2011 State of the Union address, to “break our dependence on oil…and becom[ing] the first country to have one million electric vehicles on the road by 2015,” North sees the market for apps to serve EV and plug-in hybrid drivers as potentially massive, but declined to quantify that in dollars.
Why would anyone offer their outlet and electricity to EV drivers, for free, though? North said they might be motivated by environmental objectives. He sees other reasons to participate, too, for example:
“Mom and pop shops along a route where there are a lot of people [driving] and not a lot of places to charge could say we want to support EVs, become part of the charging network and draw customers. Electricity costs about 15 cents an hour in most of the U.S. now, so it’s not much of an expense to do this.”

Since PlugShare relies on volunteer providers of electrical outlets, and is free to download, it is reminiscent of CouchSurfing.org, a global network of travelers and people with accommodations to offer them, free. Over time, it could come to look more like an AirBnB for EV drivers and anyone offering them power.
Armen Petrosian the co-founder and chief technology officer of Xatori, noted: “Our mission right now is to have this be free and very simple and get as many people to sign up as we can.”
Xatori tested the PlugShare application with a small group of about twenty users in California’s Bay Area prior to launch. As its user base grows, the company hopes to launch a study of the app’s impact on the environment, including how well it encourages and enables the use of electric vehicles over others, the co-founders said.
The company will compete, if not directly, with the likes of Coulomb Technologies and Ecotality, companies that build and install EV charging station networks, and which both offer apps mapping their installed base of charging stations, The EV Project and MyChargePoint.net, respectively.

782,Energy Efficiency Measures Saved AT&T $44 Million In 2010,https://techcrunch.com/2011/03/03/energy-efficiency-att-2010-results/,2011/03/03," Telecommunications giant AT&T announced the results of its 2010 energy efficiency efforts today. According to the company’s own report, it saw $44 million in annualized energy savings as a result of implementing 4,200 energy efficiency projects at its facilities last year. These included familiar technologies that, pervasively applied, made a big difference, like:

Swapping incandescent light bulbs with light emitting diodes (LEDs) at 1,100 cell sites
Removing switches and upgrading networks at 11 offices, reducing the company’s network-related power consumption by some 300,000 kilowatt hours
Using desktop power management software on 169,000 computers


AT&T has done some form of environmental accounting (corporate social responsibility or CSR reports as they’re referred to now) since at least 1995, so they have some cred. The timing of this green news, however, seems part of a strategic effort to win the public, and institutional investors’ favor at a challenging time. The company has generated a mixed bag of headlines of late.
On the upside, AT&T rolled out new wireless internet billing options for tablet users, struck a deal that brings AT&T hotspot access to the Nintendo 3DS, and another deal with Placecast to offer location based shopping alerts.
On the downside, the company’s facing legal woes, reputation management issues and competition from Verizon. This week, the Supreme Court overturned a ruling that was keeping AT&T safe from some scrutiny by competitors.
As reported by James Vicini for Reuters, AT&T had to turn over files to the government in past investigations about the way it, perhaps inappropriately, billed schools for internet services while participating in a federal program to help schools and libraries get internet access. The FCC then disclosed some of the files to competitors who directly requested them.
Here’s what the court’s blog said of the new decision:

“The Court rule[d] unanimously that corporations, as artificial persons, are not given a right of “personal privacy” that shields from public disclosure records that they have had to turn over to government investigators…”
AT&T has also generated a bad mojo meme after one of the company’s billing agents, according to The Consumerist, told a family suffering from the loss of their patriarch that that they had to upgrade their service to the AT&T Uverse plan in order to change the bill holders’ name. (The bill had been under the father and husband’s name.)
Finally, AT&T is still navigating the waters of a market where it’s not the only provider of service for the iPhone and iPad.
Is sustainability enough to keep consumers and investors with AT&T?  Environmentalists would like to make the case that at the very least, energy efficiency programs and other CSR efforts encourage brand loyalty.

783,Highlights (And Low Budgets) From The ARPA-E Energy Innovation Summit 2011,https://techcrunch.com/2011/03/02/2011-arpa-e-summit-wrap/,2011/03/02," Today marked the last day of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA-E) 2011 summit in Washington D.C. Here are some of the deals and agency decisions revealed or discussed at the summit, which are likely to impact green tech investors and startups in America for years to come.
Progress on seed investments…
The D.O.E. boasted that six, private companies that it seed-funded last year have raised a collective $100 million in additional private capital. Five of those companies are based in Massachusetts, and one in California, respectively:

1366 Technologies – manufacturing technology providers that help silicon photovoltaics manufacturers cut their costs and therefore the overall cost of installed solar power.
FloDesign – a company that uses aerospace technology to develop everything from wind turbines, and noise reducers to, yes, weapons and stealth aircraft.
SunCatalytix – an energy storage and renewable fuels company that’s working on a way of generating solar power from light and water.
General Compression – compressed air energy storage technology that makes intermittent renewable power, primarily from wind farms, more useful at a large-scale.
24M Technologies – a spin-out from A123 Systems that’s making lithium-ion electric car batteries that store more energy for a lower price compared to what’s available today.
Envia Systems – a developer of lithium-ion batteries made of a proprietary, composite cathode material that, ARPA-E reports, have the highest energy density in the world.


Climate changing attitudes…
Leaders in energy and clean tech — including from the private sector and Obama administration — spoke on a range of subjects at the summit, including ARPA-E budget cuts, spending what’s left and where, and changing attitudes about clean energy and climate change.
The list of speakers included Energy Secretary Steven Chu, the U.S. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus, and former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger along with 85 others. [Ed’s note: Why couldn’t ARPA-E find any African-Americans to speak at this summit? Check out the not so diverse speaker list in full, and let us know who you would have recommended for a more equal opportunity event in the comments below.]
As Jenny Mandel reported for Greenwire’s Environment & Energy, the “Gov” said it was time to end debates over climate change, face the music of global warming, and stop acting defeatist about America’s chances to lead clean energy and green tech industries on the world economic stage.

Tightening the purse strings…
Secretary Chu remained optimistic about ARPA-E’s impact thus far and potential to drive further positive developments in clean energy at home, hedging questions about the agency’s budget for 2011.
As Eli Kintisch reported on the fate of the agency’s budget for Science Insider, earlier this week:


“The young agency [ARPA-E]… is living off $15 million it received in 2009 after having committed some $400 million in stimulus funding. Without more money, the program will have to start cutting staff members or other expenses this summer…
The White House request[ed] $550 million for ARPA-E in 2012, [but] Congress had authorized only $306 million for the agency in last year’s reauthorization of the America COMPETES Act. Even $50 million for the rest of the fiscal year would put a squeeze on the agency. ARPA-E might stay alive, but it would be a shell of the juggernaut that attracted 2000 people to the [summit event].”

Storing power, greening the military…
From what’s left to spend, U.S. Navy secretary Mabus revealed at the event, the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy were striking a partnership to green the military’s energy use with more powerful, portable fuel cell, battery and smart grid technology. [Hat tip: Green Car Congress]
Through the agreement, the Navy would start to use grid, and power storage systems developed by ARPA-E in its operations. The DOD and DOE plan to spend some $25 million, starting next year (2012) to develop two particular projects, here.
One thing they will support is the development of a hybrid power storage system that’s got enough energy density to charge military equipment in the field, but is portable, and can therefore help reduce diesel consumption, as well as time spent refueling in the field.
Another thing they will support is research into power storage and grid systems that can help the Navy ensure power is always-available at all their buildings, regardless of high gas prices and decreasing budgets, political unrest in oil-producing nations, or the intermittent qualities of renewable energy sources like wind and solar.

784,"Genomatica Raises $45 Million To Make Sustainable Chemicals, And Greener Spandex (A Good Thing, In This Case)",https://techcrunch.com/2011/03/01/genomatic-raises-45-million/,2011/03/01," Genomatica, a San Diego based producer of chemicals from renewable sources including sugar, raised $45 million in a new round led by VantagePoint Venture Partners, a fund that has committed $2.5 billion to cleantech.
Bright Capital, a venture capital company, joined the round as well with Waste Management, a large provider of waste management services in North America, and the company’s earlier investors including: Alloy Ventures, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Mohr Davidow Ventures and TPG Biotech. Altogether, Genomatica has raised $85 million in venture capital.
The company will use its new round to bring its first, commercial product mass market. The product is “Bio-BDO,” a chemical that can replace oil or natural-gas derived 1,4-butanediol (regular BDO) in the manufacture of spandex, automotive plastics, running shoes and more.
Bio-BDO is made from renewable feedstocks — a range of sugars— according to the company’s website.  Genomatica expects its commercial-scale plant to make Bio-BDO will become fully operational in late 2013. The company will also spend part of its latest round developing additional chemicals from renewable sources.

785,"Solar Equipment Made From Castor Beans, BioBacksheets, Going Commercial In U.S.",https://techcrunch.com/2011/03/01/biosolar-backsheets-ul-certified/,2011/03/01," BioSolar, a small public company (OTCBB: BSRC.OB) that makes solar backsheets — a component of the equipment used to hold solar photovoltaic modules in place within frames and racks, and to protect the modules from weather and other damage — attained safety certifications from Underwriter Laboratories this week.
The UL-certification enables BioSolar to sell its backsheets to a variety of North American solar panel manufacturers and solar developers who seek to integrate them into products they ship.
BioSolar’s BioBacksheets are made of fully recyclable and biodegradable materials derived from a non-food, renewable crop, castor beans (image, below). Other industry standard backsheets are made of polyvinyl fluoride, polyester or laminated film— materials that may be UV- and weather-resistant, but are made from petroleum, and are not biodegradable or recyclable. They can even be toxic.

In an interview with TechCrunch before the company attained its certifications, BioSolar chief executive David Lee said:


“The solar industry has been growing by leaps and bounds in the last 20 years. Its about time for us to look at the impact of what we are doing as the solar industry to the environment. Are we sustainable as an industry? [We] want to make solar a truly green source of energy.
I remember 20-30 years ago, when silicon kicked off technology development, we had this boom in the economy. Later, the big tech manufacturers realized we’ve created a pollution issue from the materials.
The solar industry should do a more responsible thing, from harvesting materials to manufacture and recycling of all the components. With Biosolar, we want to make sure we are environmentally friendly and at the same time that our green technologies are cost-effective.”


The company is focused on selling within North America for now, but Lee said BioSolar will seek international certifications akin to the UL mark to expand sales globally in the future.
BioSolar faces competition from incumbents like DUNMORE and DuPont that supply backsheets to massive solar panel makers, already.

786,"Nexus EnergyHomes Raises $1.5 Million To Build Luxury, Net Zero Energy Houses",https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/28/nexus-energy-homes-1-5-million/,2011/02/28," Annapolis-based Nexus EnergyHomes raised the first $200,000 of a $1.5 million dollar series A round, a new SEC filing revealed. The company designs, sells and builds pre-fab homes that are “net zero,” or zero energy homes (ZEHs).
According to the U.S. Department of Energy ZEHs are “connected to the utility grid but can be designed and constructed to produce as much energy as they consume [or more] annually.”
Nexus EnergyHomes also makes and sells green building materials, and offers software to optimize the installation of, and manage the use of equipment in a net zero energy home — like air conditioners, filters, lights, meters, geothermal wells and solar power generating systems. The company’s software, under the brand name Energyze, also helps home builders attain rebates and incentives to build a ZEH.
Representatives were not available immediately after the filing was made public to answer questions about the company’s investors, or how the firm plans to use its new-found capital.
Because Nexus Energy Homes focuses on building in and around Maryland, they are guarded, at least for the time being, against competition from established zero net energy home designers, like Ecofutures in Colorado or Vert Design in Ottawa.
A regional specialization will not, however, protect the business from competition on software and systems that it sells. Giant technology providers to venture-backed startups are angling for a piece of the green homes market, including GE and Fuji Electric, and OPOWER and Tendril which both specialize in home-based, energy management technology.

787,"Dow Chemical Spending $100 Million On Energy Efficiency, Emissions Reduction",https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/28/dowchemical-incentivizing-energy-efficiency/,2011/02/28," The Dow Chemical Company (NYSE: DOW) — which makes specialty materials and chemicals for electronics, automotive, water, energy and agricultural sectors — today announced that it aims to green its own operations, in part, by investing $100 million in internally pitched projects that will reduce the company’s energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
Doug May, vice president of energy and climate change at Dow, noted in a press statement that a focus on “carbon management” and reduced energy consumption would deliver favorable financial returns for the Midland, Mich. company that has, of late, rebounded from mid-2010 losses.
Earlier this month, Dow reported sales of $13.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2010, which was 22 percent higher compared to the same period a year earlier. (The company’s net income from continuing operations was $513 million, compared to $178 million in 2009.)
So far, business units and manufacturing sites at Dow have submitted around 60 project proposals, the company reported. These represent a potential 8 trillion BTUs of energy savings, and a reduction of over 400 thousand metric tons of CO2 emissions according to Dow’s own assessment. From 1994 to 2010, carbon management-related projects have contributed to cost savings of $9.4 billion Dow estimated.
The company has a recently-mixed track record with environmentalists. Dow has clashed with Greenpeace, which says the company spied on it, and on other environmental advocates and research organizations.
In 2010, The Political Economy Research Institute (PERI), an independent unit of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, ranked Dow Chemical as one of the twenty most air polluting companies in America. That represented a significant improvement from 2006 when Dow ranked third on that list, however.
The company reports on its corporate and social responsibility impacts via the Global Reporting Institute standards, as well. Its 2010 report has not yet been published, but in 2009, Dow attained an A+ rating based on the GRI measurements of overall sustainability.

788,Solo Drivers In Los Angeles Will Soon Be Allowed To Drive In Carpool Lanes For A Fee,https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/25/pay-to-drive-solo-in-carpool-lane-xerox/,2011/02/25," This week,  Affiliated Computer Services, Inc. (ACS) — which was acquired by Xerox (NYSE: XRX) in February 2010 — announced that it’s building a new, electronic toll system on the two busiest highways in Los Angeles, to allow all single car drivers, even those in diesel guzzling Hummers, to shift into carpool lanes for a fee.
When average traffic levels in a carpool lane rise overall, so will the fee. The company and city plan to calibrate the systems to keep traffic at a steady 45 miles per hour in the carpool lane (at least). Once equipped with the new toll system, the carpool lanes along Interstate 10 and Interstate 110 will be called ExpressLanes, instead.
Los Angeles and Xerox are building this project with the idea of reducing highway congestion overall, according to a press statement from ACS and reports by Green.Autoblog.com.
Is the death of the carpool lane as we know it environmentally sound, though?
The faster, wide open appeal of a carpool lane is supposed to motivate Los Angelenos to roll with their homeys, instead of Swingers style; remember that distinctly not-green-scene where Vince Vaughn and his friends drive individually but together to party after party? At least, a carpool lane’s supposed to encourage drivers to buy clean vehicles.
The Department of Motor Vehicles and state law in California allows vehicles with a qualifying “clean alternative fuel vehicle sticker” to drive in high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes.

Ken Philmus, senior vice president and managing director of ACS Transportation Systems and Services, believes that a pay-to-switch-lanes system is a win for the environment, of course. Here’s why, he explained:

“When people are stuck in traffic, watching the other lane, they might be encouraged to get into a carpool, later. Only 10 percent of vehicles [in Los Angeles] are multi-occupant, generally. So, there’s under-utilized capacity in [high occupancy vehicle, or HOV] lanes.
With this system, as the HOV lane gets more congested, the toll to shift over goes up, which should result in fewer [single car drivers] going in, and a free flow that’s maintained. It should not damage the occupancy of the lane. But it should maintain or improve environmentally positive aspects of the lane, by getting people out of stop and go traffic. That’s where the air quality situation becomes worse, usuall.” 

ACS and Xerox are not charged with studying things like improvements in air quality, or reduction in diesel consumption in Los Angeles, resulting from this project in any official capacity, Philmus said. That job will be up to the likes of the Federal Highway Administration, local air quality management offices and departments of transportation instead.
To participate, Los Angeles drivers will need to sign up for a FasTrak toll account, and install a small transponder in their vehicles. They will be asked to set a switch on the transponder to indicate whether they’re driving solo and the system should charge them; or if they’re part of a carpool and can drive for free in the ExpressLanes. Sensors installed along the interstate will calculate the dynamically priced tolls and deduct the proper amount from a driver’s prepaid account, automatically.
The ExpressLanes Project in Los Angeles is projected to open to traffic in late 2012. Similar systems have been installed in Miami, where they’re known as HOT lanes (high occupancy toll lanes), and are averaging around $3.50 or $4.00 a toll during rush hour, and are about 16 miles per hour faster than regular, free lanes according to reports in the Miami Herald.

Auto maker BMW recently established a New York-based venture capital firm dubbed BMW i Ventures that it seeded with $100 million to seek out partnerships that might facilitate BMW-i product adoption in urban markets. BMW-i is a BMW sub-brand solely focused on developing and producing sustainable mobility vehicles.
Its first investment was made public this week: BMW pumped $5 million into MyCityWay, a user-driven, location-aware city guide. FirstMark Capital and IA Ventures, who participated in an earlier $1 million seed round, joined BMW.
Useful for locals and visitors alike, MyCityWay is an interactive tool for urban exploration and discovery on your mobile device (iOS, Android, BlackBerry coming soon). The app brings together more than 50 local mobility apps in one interface to act as a one-stop, location-aware platform to discover, connect, experience and share.
The app is available for more than 40 cities worldwide, including New York City, Shanghai, Tokyo, London and Paris.

790,"Disposables Debate: Can Recycling, Materials Innovation Make Plastic Bag Bans Obsolete?",https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/24/disposables-debate-bag-ban-controversy/,2011/02/24," Single-use plastic grocery bags, and the various fees, taxes and bans proposed to curb pollution from their disposal, are causing controversy again this week.
A newly surfaced study, still under peer review, suggests that disposable bags aren’t as bad for the environment as re-usable cotton bags.
The study — The Life Cycle Assessment of Supermarket Carrier Bags by Dr. Chris Edwards and Jonna Meyhoff Fry — was done for a government environmental agency in the UK. As reported by Martin Hickman for The Independent its authors found:
“[By] assessing pollution caused by extraction of raw materials, production, transportation and disposal…an HDPE plastic bag would have a baseline global warming potential of 1.57 kg Co2 equivalent, falling to 1.4 kg Co2e if re-used once, the same as a paper bag used four times (1.38 kg Co2e). A cotton bag would have to be re-used 171 times to emit a similar level, 1.57 kg Co2e.”

These results make it seem like a shopper would have to use a cotton bag 171 times or more before displacing the equivalent environmental impact of one plastic bag. Contextualizing studies that make disposables look downright green, however, environmental researcher Susan Freinkel — whose book PLASTIC: A Toxic Love Story will be out in April — told TechCrunch (via email):

“If energy is a top concern, then plastic bags do come out with a nicely ‘green’ profile. But that’s not the only measure of a bag’s environmental impact.
Plastic has one big downside: it persists in the environment…Unlike paper or cotton, it doesn’t biodegrade. It only breaks up into smaller and smaller pieces. Persistence is a big deal if you’re concerned about pollution and the health of wildlife.
Plastic bags can clog storm drains, which was why Mumbai, among other places decided to ban them.  [They] are one of the top categories of beach debris collected in international beach clean-ups every year, according to the Ocean Conservancy’s annual beach clean-up reports.
Wildlife often mistakes plastic bags for food and can choke on [or get entangled in] them— from camels in Dubai to sea turtles in the Pacific.”


While startups like EcoLogic LLC are trying to get plastic manufacturers to make their materials less persistent, using high-tech additives and processes, several industry players want to increase plastic bag recycling programs.
Unfortunately, though plenty of municipalities and retailers collect plastic bags and polyethylene film for recycling in the U.S. today, it’s still not available everywhere, according to website of the American Chemistry Council (a strong opponent to regulating plastic bags).
Hilex Poly — a corporation that both makes and recycles massive amounts of plastic bags — created a legislation tracker via GoogleMaps to protest bag bans and promote recycling instead.
Waste reduction has proven significant in cities and countries where bags have been banned and taxed: Ireland saw a 90 percent reduction in disposable plastic bag use post-regulation the BBC reported; and San Francisco lowered plastic bag waste citywide by about 20 percent according to the SF Environment Department.
[Ed’s note: If you know of any recycling initiatives that produced similar results, we’d like to hear about them. Send research to tips@techcrunch.com noting “green tech” in the subject line.]
Sustainable packaging and bioplastic companies have joined both sides of the debate.
Metabolix, a company that spun out of MIT in the 1990s and now makes renewable crop-derived plastics, along with the Biodegradable Products Institute and many others opposed legislation that would have banned free, disposable plastic bags at large retail outlets in California, for example.
Meanwhile, Cereplast sees regulation as a market opportunity. In January this year, the bioplastic company issued a press statement noting:
“Stores in Italy alone use approximately 20-24 billion plastic bags a year, which accounts for one-fifth of all European use. This is the equivalent of a potential $1 billion  bioplastics market in Italy as manufacturers now have to replace traditional plastic with environmentally-friendly materials.”

Will reusables always trump throw aways when it comes to environmental concerns? Or could clean tech and sustainable packaging innovators give us a net zero, single-use bag?
 It’s not a material issue, says Freinkel, behavior and context matters too. She wrote:
“Comparing the environmental impacts of different type of bags diverts away from the real issue here, namely that the problem isn’t so much the material a bag is made from as the way in which the bag is used. Single-use bags made of any material are a waste of valuable resources. Both paper and plastic single-use bags involve using finite and precious resources that took decades, in the case of trees, and hundreds of millions of years in the case of oil or natural gas to make, to produce something we use for the 15 minutes it takes to get from the grocery store to our front door.
Reusable bags are a step away from that throwaway mindset. As long as it can be used over and over, a reusable bag of any type is the best, most sustainable choice.”

791,Phononic Devices Raises $10 Million To Turn Heat Waste Into Energy,https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/23/phononic-devices-10-millio/,2011/02/23," A Raleigh, North Carolina-based maker of thermoelectric coolers and generators, Phononic Devices, closed a $10 million series B investment from Venrock and Oak Investment Partners, the companies revealed today.
Often explained as “solid-state heat pumps,” thermoelectric technology (a.k.a. thermoelectrics) can capture wasted heat, and convert it into power. They can also displace heat and maintain a cool temperature in everything from laptops to refrigerators and lasers. The technology provides an environmental benefit versus compression-based refrigeration and other power generating technologies, because thermoelectric modules don’t use toxic coolants or burn fossil fuels, and generate no noise. They have no moving parts.
Thermoelectric technology has also been around for decades.
President and chief executive officer of Phononic Devices, Anthony Atti, said his company’s particular brand of thermoelectrics are distinct from incumbent varieties because:
“[Existing thermoelectric modules] have used bismuth telluride and bismuth selenide. Our proprietary materials are from a different class of elements [on the periodic table]. They are abundant domestically, low-cost and can be manufactured and integrated with existing operations across semi-conductor industries. Our thermoelectrics are also much more efficient than others.”

Phononic Devices previously attained a $3 million grant from the Advanced Research Projects Agency Energy program (ARPA-E)  to improve the efficiency of thermoelectrics in cooling and converting waste heat to power.
According to an ARPA-E press statement on the company:

“In today’s energy landscape [Americans] generate most electricity by making heat, whether it’s through burning coal or splitting atoms. That heat makes steam which turns a turbine and makes electricity…Most of the heat is wasted, a staggering 50-60% according to Department of Energy estimates.
Phononic Devices [devices are projected to] dramatically improve thermoelectric efficiency from less than 10 percent today to more than 30 percent, resulting in a dollar-per-watt energy savings of 75 percent for power generation and 60 percent for cooling, respectively.”


Dr. Atti said his startup aims to bring its thermoelectric modules (image, right: they’re about the size of a matchbox) to the market of electronics cooling, first — which encompasses consumer electronics, military equipment, and medical and laser instruments — and to refrigeration for residential use. Longer term, they should be applicable in air conditioners, he said.
A partner and clean tech investor with Venrock, Matt Trevithick  said the company’s highly efficient thermoelectrics — spun out of the University of Oklahoma’s tech transfer program — had disruptive potential, reminiscent of LED lighting:

“Cooling compressors have been refined for a century. They work well enough, despite some known problems, and are cheap enough to be widely deployed. We think Phononic Devices finally has a solid state technology that has the performance metrics necessary to compete directly against compressors.
This is an outlier opportunity. Other technology exists, but does not have the efficiency to compete against vapor compression technology. The story I expect will unfold will be the one that’s now unfolding with solid state lighting, which is just now becoming good enough, performance-wise, and is priced appropriately enough to compete against incandescent lights.”


Dr. Atti said his company plans to grow from about ten full-time employees today to about seventy in three or four years. He would not name specific target customers, but said Phononic Devices will use its new-found capital to develop commercial manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. and build its market.  The company is pre-revenue.
Corporations that use cooling technology in their high-tech products— like Siemens, GE, LG, Samsung, HP, JDS Uniphase or Honeywell — could all grace Phononics’ list of prospective customers.  For a piece of that robust market, the company faces competition from peers in the field of thermoelectrics like Nextreme and MicroPelt, which have focused on harvesting heat in, and powering or cooling wearable, or low power consuming wireless devices.

792,"GoodGuide Ranks Mobile Phone Sustainability: RIM Worst, Nokia Best",https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/17/goodguide-new-mobile-rankings/,2011/02/17,"Click image, right, to enlarge.
Today, GoodGuide (a TechCrunch50 alumni company) added mobile phone rankings to their comprehensive database that ranks the environmental and social performance of products, and the companies that make them.
In its new mobile phone category, the San Francisco startup ranked 576 different handsets and chargers from 16 top mobile phone makers in the U.S. market. GoodGuide assessed everything from the “ingredients” that go into the phones, to each device’s energy efficiency, recyclable qualities, and manufacturers’ willingness to disclose details about its supply chain, materials and more.
For environmental performance and impact of the companies overall: RIM came in dead last, Nokia topped the GoodGuide environmental chart, and Apple stood at third place.
No Apple iPhone cracked the top fifteen GoodGuide list of the most environmentally friendly devices, despite the company’s strong overall showing. The Nokia C6 Cell Phone took top honors, followed closely by Samsung’s Blue EarthMobile Phone. RIM’s Blackberry Bold 9000 Smartphone was the worst-rated handset. [Ed’s note: See screenshot above, for further ratings.]
GoodGuide founder Dara O’Rourke explained why Apple was viewed favorably as a company, but its phones were not rated as environmentally friendly:


“Apple released a new supplier responsibility report this week, which won the company points.
Until this year, though, Apple could not even tell you what metals or minerals were in their phones, or where they came from…Along with other mobile manufacturers, their stance had been: we can’t tell you whether conflict minerals are in our phones, and we can’t tell you who manufactured a sub-component of what’s in there — it’s proprietary, competitive, or not something we know.
Now, it’s 2011. The industry is playing catch up on all of this. Consumers are demanding to know more. There are still a lot of details that Apple hasn’t disclosed about their iPhones though. A lack of transparency on each product keeps the iPhone — and the Blackberry — lower in the product rankings.”

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act may soon require phone manufacturers to disclose such details.
The scientist who led the mobile phone research for GoodGuide, Pedro Vieira, said that to derive its product-scores, the company licenses and compiles studies from government, academic, business and independent research organizations, adding some of their own proprietary data to the mix. The company assigns a weight to each study so that a company-provided claim about its own product will be worth less than an independent, scientific lab’s research into the same item.
Unlike other sustainability reports on mobile phones — like the O2 Ecoratings in the U.K. market, or Greenpeace’s Guide to Greener Electronics —  GoodGuide reported environmental and social impact as separate scores, offered company and product-level scores, and provided information about phones’ radiation levels (not counted in their scores) for consumers who believe this could pose a health risk.
O’Rourke noted that ultimately, his company aims to help people find brands and products that align with their own social, health and environmental concerns, but doesn’t want to advocate what those values should be, or which brands they should choose.  He doesn’t believe that GoodGuide scores would convince even the most tree-hugging, granola-eating Apple fan to switch to a Nokia. He hopes that such ratings will, however, give consumers motivation to pressure companies they buy from to be as transparent as possible, though, and to improve the sustainability of their products and operations.
GoodGuide’s top ten list of the most environmentally sensible phone manufacturers included:
1.Nokia
2.Sony Ericsson
3.Apple
4.Pantech
5.Palm
6.Kyocera Sanyo
7.Motorola
8.HTC

794,Harris Poll: Majority of Americans Oppose Cuts To Pollution Control Spending,https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/16/harris-poll-epa-budget/,2011/02/16," A new poll from Harris Interactive finds that a majority of Americans oppose government budget cuts impacting mass transportation (by 54 to 35 percent) and pollution controls (by 54 to 37 percent). If elected officials are taking those results seriously, they may need to revise some of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed 2012 budget to maintain constituents’ favor.
This week, the EPA announced its 2012 budget would reign in the agency’s spending by about 13 percent from $10.3 billion in 2011 to $8.973 billion. The EPA’s fiscal year 2012 begins October 1, 2011 and ends September 30, 2012.
Feeling the pinch would be programs that: protect the Great Lakes; clean up hazardous waste sites; and help states provide clean and safe drinking water to their residents.

Specifically, the Superfund program to support cleanup at hazardous waste sites, would be slashed by $70 million to $1.2 billion for 2012; spending on projects “strategically chosen to target the most significant threats to people’s health in the Great Lakes ecosystem,” would lose $125 million year over year; and the hardest hit (by dollar amount) would be the Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds (SRFs) program, which could lose $947 million from 2010 to 2012.
The president’s budget still faces Congressional approval — House Republicans have suggested a plan with twice the cuts for the EPA, especially related to air pollution programs.
SustainableBusiness.com reported:

“Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), chairman of the Interior-EPA spending panel, said his goal is to keep the EPA from implementing greenhouse gas regulations through the remainder of the fiscal year, so that House Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton has time to pass a long-term bill to block the regulations.”
The president’s proposed budget actually increases spending on air pollution controls, though it takes away from water and hazardous waste sites. As Greenwire noted Monday “state and local air quality agencies would receive $79.5 million more than they are getting at the fiscal 2010 funding level.”
Some other programs that would survive and thrive, despite the suggested purse-tightening of the Obama administration, would benefit businesses and institutions with a heavy research and development focus, and enforcement officials.
According to the EPA website, the Science to Achieve Results (STAR) grants program, for example, would see a $24.7 million increase in spending to ensure that the EPA procures and/or uses “best-in-class science [and technology] to protect air, water and land.” There would also be an increase of $584 million in spending to support research and innovation into new and emerging environmental science.
Additional spending would go to enforcement, namely increased inspections and oversight of chemical and oil facilities to the tune of a $27.5 million increase for enforcement and compliance, using what the EPA called “e-reporting and monitoring tools.”
Majorities of Americans, according to the same Harris Poll referenced above, may not be happy about that, either. They favor cutting “spending by regulatory agencies (by 56 to 28 percent)… and subsidies to business (by 51 to 37 percent).”

795,Paperless Billing Service Doxo Raises $10 Million In Series B Funding,https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/15/doxo-10-million/,2011/02/15,"
Paperless billing is one of those things that is slower to take hold than it should, but it just seems inevitable that is how we all will be receiving our bills sooner or later.  One startup trying to speed along the paperless era is Doxo, which just raised a $10 million.  The Series B financing was led by Sigma Partners, with previous investors Mohr Davidow and Bezos Expeditions participating.
Thomas Layton, the former CEO of OpenTable from 2001 to 2007, also invested and is joining Doxo’s board of directors.  Greg Gretsch from Sigma is also taking a board seat.  This round brings the total raised by Doxo to $15 million since it was founded in 2008.  As I described the service last year:
Doxo is a cloud-based service which works in tandem with existing paperless billing systems, but aims to be much simpler and appealing for consumers. It will be a single place where all your most critical transactional records (bills, statements, explanation of benefits) will be stored on your behalf. And you can be notified any number of ways, via email, mobile apps, SMS, and so on.
Businesses pay about $10 a year per customer to send paper bills.  Doxo aims to greatly reduce that cost, and gives consumers one place to manage all their paperless bills.  Companies offering Doxo as a billing option include Sprint, Kansas City Power & Light, and Puget Sound Energy.  The service is still invite-only, but if you want to try it out enter the code “techcrunch” here.

796,Philips Predicts LEDs Will Take 50 Percent Of Lighting Market By 2015,https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/15/philips-predicts-leds-will-take-50-percent-of-lighting-market-by-2015/,2011/02/15," Today, Philips announced that their Philips Ambient LED 12.5 watt light bulb — which gives off as much light as incandescent 60 watt bulbs, using less energy — attained Energy Star qualifications. It’s the first LED light bulb of this type to gain approval in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sponsored program. Energy Star sanctioned products are usually eligible for utility rebate programs that can lower the cost of a product for consumers, while allowing a company to keep their margins strong.
According to Philips, its bulb lasts 25 times longer and uses 80 percent less energy than the 60 watt incandescent bulb it was designed to replace. A company press statement reported that in order to obtain the Energy Star label, its LED bulb had to demonstrate a minimum light output of 800 lumens, a color temperature of 2700K (for soft white light), color rendering index (CRI) of 80 and a minimum three-year warranty; it actually offers 806 lumens, 2700K, a CRI of 80 and a six-year warranty. The bulbs are currently selling at Home Depot for $39.97.
A Philips company representative told TechCrunch the bulbs are also recyclable. The lighting corporation wasn’t issuing predictions about how much the Energy Star qualification would drive sales of its Ambient 12.5 watt bulbs. More macroscopically, however, Philips predicts LEDs will take 50 percent of the residential lighting market by 2015.

Other companies are sure to follow in Philips’ footsteps, from large and medium-sized businesses like Cree (NASDAQ: CREE) and the Lighting Science Group Corporation (OTCB: LSCG) to younger startups like Bridgelux.
The Durham, N.C.-based Cree now has a demonstration 60 watt incandescent replacement LED bulb — the TrueWhite Light — that the company claims is the industry’s brightest and most efficient, and meets Energy Star performance criteria. A company spokesperson said Tuesday that Cree submitted it to an independent testing facility, with testing on track to be completed by the fall. (Energy Star doesn’t test bulbs for certification.)
Meanwhile, LSCG has an Energy Star approved line, called DEFINITY. Bulbs in this line, the company announced today, have been installed in Yankee Candle Stores throughout New England. LSCG claims these are approximately 80% more efficient than the halogen bulbs that they replace, are “dimmable,” contain no mercury, and are completely recyclable.  Yankee Candle received rebates from National Grid and Western Mass Electric Company through the Mass Save program, and other electric utility companies throughout New England.

797,"Funding: $3 Million More For Large-Scale Geothermal Contractors, Enlink Geoenergy",https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/14/enlinkgeoenergy-craton-3million/,2011/02/14," A new SEC filing revealed today that Los Angeles-based clean energy business, Enlink Geoenergy Services raised $3 million more from Craton Equity Partners to build large-scale, geothermal systems for businesses and government institutions.
Here’s how the heat pump technology that’s most frequently installed by Enlink Geoenergy works, according toThe Union of Concerned Scientists:

“Ground-source heat pumps take advantage of the constant year-round temperature of about 50°F that is just a few feet below the ground’s surface. Either air or antifreeze liquid is pumped through pipes that are buried underground, and re-circulated into the building. In the summer, the liquid moves heat from the building into the ground. In the winter, it does the opposite, providing pre-warmed air and water to the heating system of the building.”
Enlink Geoenergy’s chief excutive, Mark Mizrahi, wrote in a December 2010 guest post for the environmental blog Cleantechnica.com, that geothermal energy systems could contribute 34 of 40 points required for LEED certification in commercial buildings.
As companies and government institutions strive to meet federal and local goals, or qualify for rebates and incentives, for operating LEED certified, or Net Zero buildings — which means that the building produces at least as much energy as it consumes, and produces no carbon emissions — Enlink Geoenergy anticipates significant growth, according to the company website.
TechCrunch called Enlink Geoenergy and its investors for further details about where they plan to apply this new round of funding.

798,Lenovo ThinkPad T420 Is First Laptop To Get UL Environment's Gold Certification,https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/14/lenovo-thinkpad-gets-ul-environment-gold/,2011/02/14,"Underwriters Laboratories’ UL Environment group — which validates claims, through lab testing, that a company or its product is environmentally sustainable, and helps thwart “greenwashing” —  today reported that its first-ever Gold level Sustainable Product Certification (SPC) for a laptop was given to the forthcoming, Lenovo ThinkPad T420.
According to a UL press statement, the SPC Gold certification indicates “a product has met the most stringent and prestigious of three levels of compliance in the industry-wide sustainability standard for laptops, IEEE 1680.1…including reduction or elimination of environmentally sensitive materials in product and packaging, energy conservation, end-of-life management and corporate environmental practices.”
In 2007, Lenovo began formal Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) reporting. In 2008, the company set a voluntary target of improving its carbon efficiency by 10 percent  between 2007 and 2012.
According to Lenovo’s 2009-2010 CSR report, the most recent available, the company has been focusing on reduction of non-recyclable materials in its product lines across the board, making its products from enterprise to consumer fully recyclable, and reducing the amount of energy its products and operations use. Its initiatives to drive customers to recycle, rather than dump their spent electronics in a landfill, have been least successful in the Americas, and most successful in markets in Europe the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).
The company has faced other environmental challenges, despite attaining Gold certifications from UL, and EPEAT on some of its products. Lenovo’s position on the Greenpeace Guide to Greener Electronics fell from top spot in the mid-2000s to fourteenth in 2010.
Here’s part of what Greenpeace had to say about the company’s overall environmental results and commitment:

“[Lenovo] remains encumbered by a penalty point imposed for backtracking on its commitment to eliminate PVC vinyl plastic and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) in all its products by the end of 2009.
[The company] made significant progress on three energy criteria; it now supports the need for global emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to peak by 2015, with a 30 percent reduction in emissions from industrialised countries by 2020 and a 50 percent reduction by 2050, relative to 1990; it has set its own targets for reducing GHG emissions, aiming to eliminate or offset its scope 1 emissions by 100 percent by April 2011 and achieve absolute reductions in scope 2 emissions, with progressive targets up to 20 percent by April 2020, relative to 2008/09; it also reports the percentage of its products that meet the latest Energy Star standards, with many of its products exceeding the standard.”


In light of the company’s track record — some good, some bad when it comes to sustainability — will certifications like this one from UL Environment help Lenovo win environmentally conscious customers?
Update: Until Lenovo can get back to us with further details on their new Thinkpad T420, here’s the company’s video press release about it, corny electric guitars and all…

799,"Telogis Raises $2.9 Million More To Help Companies Manage Fleets, Reduce Emissions",https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/11/telogis-2-9-million-more/,2011/02/11," Telogis, a location-based technology firm in Aliso Viejo, Calif. has raised another $2.9 million, according to a new SEC filing, to help businesses track and manage their fleets of vehicles, and workforce using GPS, mobile and web technology.
The company touts its “mobile resource management” software and services as environmentally beneficial, and fuel-saving. According to the Telogis website, its mapping and fleet-management systems help companies: cut [drivers’] idling by more than 25 percent, reduce miles driven out-of-route by 30 percent, and can reduce speeding for better fuel economy.
Telogis systems also “provide baseline data, ongoing collection and record-keeping on [a fleet’s] greenhouse gas output,” to help companies stay compliant with rapidly evolving, environmental and transportation legislation.
The Department of Energy via Fueleconomy.gov reports that:

“Aggressive driving (speeding, rapid acceleration and braking) wastes gas. It can lower gas mileage by 33 percent at highway speeds and by 5 percent around town…While each vehicle reaches its optimal fuel economy at a different speed (or range of speeds), gas mileage usually decreases rapidly at speeds above 60 mph… Each 5 mph driven over 60 mph is like paying an additional $0.24 per gallon for gas.”
Founded in 2001, the company previously raised a $3.5 million round in 2009, and a $2 million round in 2010. The filings did not disclose which funds were involved in these deals.
According to Crunchbase (TechCrunch’s open directory of technology companies, innovators and products) BNP Paribas backed the company. Feb. 12, 2011 Update: A spokesperson from Telogis called TechCrunch to let us know that a Crunchbase user provided inaccurate data on their business. (Corrections have been added to Crunchbase as well.) BNPParibas was not involved in funding this company.
Company representatives said Telogis’ funding rounds, including this latest for $2.9 million, have all been led by angel investors who did not wish to be named at this time. Each round corresponds to an acquisition by Telogis.
The company has a sales footprint spanning 60 countries, and at the end of 2009 had attained annual revenue of $17.1 million, according to the Inc. 5000 index of America’s fastest-growing, privately owned companies.
On Tuesday this week, Telogis announced that it acquired Intergis, another location-based tech company that specialized in “routing, mobile resource and fleet management software and services for small to mid-sized businesses,” according to a press statement.

800,Segway 2.0? German Bicycle on Steroids Comes to the US,https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/11/segway-2-0-german-bicycle-on-steriods-comes-to-the-us/,2011/02/11,"Fair or unfair, German Web entrepreneurs get a bad rap for being copy cats. If Stefan Gulas is any representation, the same can’t be said for German entrepreneurs making…what I guess you would call futuristic motorized bicycles?
Gulas has spent the last six years building something called the eROCKIT that defies a vehicle category. Unlike a motorcycle, it’s active– you have to pedal to make it go. But unlike a motorized bicycle it goes incredibly fast. So fast it can out accelerate a car. And it’s completely electric, borrowing some technology and looks from your home exercise bike.
Amazingly, Gulas bootstrapped it, without any real vehicle engineering know-how. He’s sold 40 of them for about 12,000 Euros each. The biggest bottleneck is production, so Gulas was in town looking for investors. Sadly for TechCrunchTV, he didn’t actually have an eROCKIT with him, but watching videos of people riding it and interacting with it and one thing was clear– there is something about this device that captivates makes people smile.
It reminds me of the Segway. You get on it and lean and suddenly you’re shooting across a room. We have one in the office and everyone who gets on it, can’t help but laugh. Similarly, you get on the  eROCKIT and pedal, expecting the ingrained sense memory of a bike’s normal acceleration, when the thing just takes off, with a top speed of 50 miles per hour and a distance of 45 miles between charges. And the eROCKIT looks cooler than a Segway. (Not hard.) Gulas has a 3 inch thick binder of press clippings– which all started when a TV reporter was captivated watching him drive the thing around Berlin.
Gulas story of why he created the company reads like a cyclist’s ultimate revenge fantasy. He loves to bike and felt it gave him the “moral superiority” on the road, but in every other way he was at the low end of the  transportation pecking order. Any cyclist who has angrily yelled, “SHARE THE ROAD!” at a car would smile at this product with more acceleration power than a car, same satisfaction of being good to the environment, and the plus of getting exercise at the same time.”You feel super human,” he says excitedly. “You are king of the road!”
Gulas thinks this odd power-pedaling will change the world of transportation and that all automobiles will become more active. I disagree. I lean more towards a future of multitasking in Google’s self-driving car than a return to the Flintstone’s car. But I could see the eROCKIT being huge in a city like San Francisco where it’s  sunny almost every day and home to one of the most aggressive pro-bike cultures on the planet.
Gulas wants to move the company headquarters to California if he’s able to close this funding round. He loves the German engineering heritage of the company, but says European investors have found the project too weird. In just a few weeks in the US, the difference in investor reception has been like night-and-day. While the knock in Europe was that he didn’t have a market for them to evaluate, he says investors here have said the lack of an existing, defined market is what interests them.
And in a strange globalization twist, he expects making the bikes would be cheaper here because some of the materials come from the US, most notably the A123 electric batteries. Either way, he hopes to start selling them here in the next year.
Some video of the eROCKIT in action below.

801,GE Acquires Tall Turbine Tech From Wind Tower Systems,https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/11/ge-wts-wind-turbine-tech/,2011/02/11," General Electric (GE, NYSE: GE) announced today that it acquired technology from Wind Tower Systems, that can enable the company to build and ship wind energy equipment that’s more efficient, taller and longer than what it offers now.
Longer wind turbine blades, generally, capture more energy from wind. Taller towers to accommodate these blades can be difficult to ship, install and keep steady in the field, however.
According to a GE press statement, the technology it acquired from Wind Tower Systems is “space frame tower system technology” for use at wind farm sites that require hub heights of 100 meters or more. The tall towers can be shipped in standard flatbed trucks, and can be installed without heavy-lift cranes, using WTS’s “Hi Jack” systems instead.
The tall space frame towers and lifting system concepts were developed by WTS with the support of the U.S. DOE and California Energy Commission to drive lower wind energy costs. GE plans to test the technology this year, and if all goes well, make it commercially available to wind farm developers in 2012.

802,Hertz Spending Estimated $10 Million On Solar Rooftops In U.S. This Year,https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/10/hertz-solar-rooftops/,2011/02/10," Rental car stalwarts, The Hertz Corporation (Hertz, NYSE:HTZ) revealed plans to install 2.3 megawatts (MW) of solar photovoltaic systems at sixteen locations across the U.S. this year.
As the first piece of their solar initiative, Hertz completed construction of a 235 kilowatt system — that’s about the size of 60 typical U.S. home solar installations — on the rooftop of their Denver International Airport business (image below). According to a company press statement, that single system is expected to “produce 342,766 kilowatt-hours of AC output and will offset approximately 650,000 pounds of CO2 annually.”
Hertz plans to install fifteen other solar power generating systems, also rooftop installations, in facilities in Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania before the end of September 2011.

Richard Broome, Senior Vice President of Hertz, told TechCrunch:

“We went into this, obviously, thinking this would be environmentally sound. But to move ahead we needed it to be a financially positive thing, too.
The timing was also right for this. We’re taking full advantage of a range of federal and local grants and rebates on this, including the Treasury’s 1603 program.
Over the long term of this project, we anticipate a positive return on investment on the millions of dollars, and to see ROI in five to seven years.”


Broome would not confirm a total budget for Hertz’s solar initiative in the U.S..
Based on the company’s disclosure that it is installing some 2.3 megawatts of multi-crystalline solar photovoltaics, however, and drawing on pricing research from Solarbuzz, TechCrunch estimates that the company will spend up to $10 million on its first sixteen solar installations.
Multi-crystalline panels in the commercial solar U.S. market are priced at about $2 right now, and industry norms would add another $2 for labor, racking and other installation costs. Federal rebates could cover about 30 percent of those costs, and Hertz could find more support from state and local programs, as well.
Generating its own electricity could help Hertz weather the transition of its fleets from gasoline models to hybrid plug-in and all-electrics. In late 2010, the company announced plans to rent electric vehicles (EVs) by the hour to customers in densely populated urban areas and campuses.
Broome confirmed that Hertz is buying its solar photovoltaics from SolarFun (a.k.a. Hanwha SolarOne) a Chinese company; and has hired Portugal-based MartiferSolar to complete designs and installations; also retaining project management services from New York-based Global Solar Center for this project.
Global Solar Center was founded by chief executive Jack Hidary, a clean tech advocate, serial entrepreneur and former CEO of Dice.com. Hidary chairs and invested in another New York City startup Samba Energy led by his brother, Michael Hidary.
Samba Energy provided solar and investment analysis, and enterprise software — Samba SunSpotter — that will be used to help Hertz manage solar installations across U.S. facilities, ongoing. The company was founded in 2009, and is angel backed by undisclosed investors. It aims to help companies that have a multitude of facilities (Hertz has thousands in the U.S. alone) automate analysis of their expenses and returns on clean energy installations.

803,"Abe's Market, Natural Products Retailer, Closes $3.4 Million Series A Investment",https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/10/abes-market-accel-series-a/,2011/02/10," A Chicago-area startup that sells natural consumer goods online, Abe’s Market, closed a $3.4 million series A investment the company announced today. Accel Partners led the round, joined by the company’s earlier investors, Index Ventures and several angels.
Abe’s Market calls itself the equivalent of an online farmer’s market, and focuses on selling non-food category natural products like beauty, bath, baby or cleaning items, though it also sells some packaged comestibles.
The site provides shoppers with tagging, reviews, and social media sharing tools and incentives. The company has also put shoppers in touch with the people behind the products sold on its site, via live “online shows” and other site content.
Abe’s Market co-founder Richard Demb said in an interview Wednesday night that his company plans to use its series A funding on expanding its reach via digital marketing initiatives, taking advantage of social media technology and trends.
Longer term, Demb said Abe’s Market will seek to build features and services that can help sellers who work with the site to grow their small businesses. In particular, the company wants to leverage the collective buying power of small sellers, for products and services that they all need — for example, labels, tags and printing services they need to package their goods, hopefully using sustainable materials.
Demb explained:

“The community of sellers we’re tapping into loves talking about what they are doing. We will frequently get groups of our sellers together, in meetings to learn about what’s going on in their lives, and not just what’s going on in their online business. We want to know how we can be a facilitator to help small businesses that make great products, and let them grow.”

Prior to starting Abe’s Market (with co-founder Jon Polin) Demb co-founded Popcorn, Indiana the company behind those bright red bags of Dale And Thomas kettle corn you see at Whole Foods. His co-founder in that endeavor, serial entrepreneur Warren Struhl, is now an investor in Abe’s Market.
Demb said the experience of working with massive retailers online and off helps him relate to his sellers as much as consumers who are curious about their products. Abe’s Market now works with some 300 brands. Demb would not comment on how much revenue he expects the company to reach by the end of the year or how many customers it has.
According to an Organic Trade Association 2010 survey referenced by the company in a press statement, the U.S. organic food and non-food sales reached $26.6 billion — up 5.3 percent from 2008-2009 — with non-food products up over 9 percent.
Adam Valkin, a partner at Accel Partners — which had earlier invested in other online marketplaces including Etsy, Diapers.com and Modcloth — told TechCrunch:

“Abe’s Market may have overlap with a lot of segments, and there are a lot of players in [specialty commerce]. But both co-founders have strong marketing backgrounds, and understand what it takes to build a differentiated brand experience and awareness about their own brand, and their sellers, too.
Building this media and marketing machine that you know gets the word out, in turn affects their ability to recruit the most desirable sellers and brands.”

Abe’s Market will compete to sell its premium, natural products against ecommerce players from fellow startups like SaffronRouge which focuses on all organic beauty products, to DailyGrommet which focuses on products made by small businesses, and against sections within goliath ecommerce sites like Wal-Mart.com/Sustainability.

804,"LED Mania: Bridgelux Adds $21 Million Funding, Digital Lumens Goes Global",https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/09/led-mania-bridgelux-digital-lumens/,2011/02/09," Despite conservatives’ misgivings about Whitehouse moves to retire old, incandescent light bulb technology (and its energy inefficiency) the market for light emitting diodes and efficient lighting systems continues to gather steam.
In the latest spate of milestones: LED-chip-makers Bridgelux scored a $21 million investment; and Digital Lumens attained certifications that will help it export its energy-efficient lighting systems to Mexico and Canada.
Last week, President Obama proposed the Better Buildings Initiative, to improve energy efficiency in commercial buildings, making them 20 percent more energy-efficient over the next decade, across the country. The program will “catalyze private sector investment through a series of incentives to upgrade offices, stores, schools and other municipal buildings, universities, hospitals, and other commercial buildings across the U.S.” according to a Whitehouse press statement.
Last year (2010) commercial buildings domestically consumed about 20 percent of all energy in the U.S. economy. In 2009, according to the most recently available U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates, commercial and residential lighting used about 13.6% of total U.S. electricity consumption.
Meanwhile Home Depot and other retailers have begun to sell LED light bulbs made by everyone from Cree to Philips (image above), that can be used in the same kinds of lamps and fixtures as incandescents, and that sometimes prove more energy-efficient than the “pig tail” variety, Energy Star certified CFL bulbs.

Bridgelux, in Livermore, Calif., makes light emitting diode chips and arrays, domestically. Its latest $21 million convertible note investment was made public in an SEC filing today.
The company’s venture investors have included: VantagePoint, DCM, El Dorado Ventures, VentureTech Alliance, Chrysalix Energy Venture Capital, and Harris & Harris Group, along with undisclosed investors.  Prior to the recent round, the company raised $113.5 million as Emma Ritch reported for Cleantech Group in January. Bridgelux did not respond immediately to requests for details on where it plans to spend its new-found capital.
 Digital Lumens (DL) in Boston, revealed today that its Intelligent Light Engines — smart fixtures for light emitting diodes — attained new safety certifications allowing the hardware to be sold widely in Mexico and Canada.
Its hardware now carries the Mexican and Canadian equivalents of Underwriters Laboratory or UL Listings in the United States — NOM (Normas Oficiales Mexicanas) and ULC (Underwriters Laboratory Canada) marks. To attain these, a product has to meet the independent labs’ safety and performance criteria.
According to Digital Lumens’ website, the fixtures form “a wireless mesh network that collects detailed energy consumption and building occupancy details,” and help building managers and engineers control and reduce their lighting related energy costs and consumption.
Since the company spun out of Groom Energy in 2008, Digital Lumens has attained venture-funding from Black Coral Capital, Flybridge Partners and Stata. It has also drawn top clean tech talent from A123 Systems and ColorKinetics.
Looking at the market for efficient lighting, overall Groom Energy and Greentech Media Research predicted that:

“The LED enterprise lighting market should grow through 2011 by 30 percent, surpassing $1 billion in annual revenue by 2014…The 2010 U.S. market for commercial and industrial LED lighting was about $330 million.”

The company’s technology and chemical processes use yeast biocatalysts to make isobutanol from sugar. Gevo’s biofuels and biochemicals will offer an alternative to petroleum-derived butanol, and in some cases, other biofuels like ethanol.
Gevo’s isobutanol, according to the company website, could be used: as fuel that’s compatible with gas tanks, in jet biofuels for military and commercial use, blended fuels, and to manufacture industrial coatings, solvents, textiles, fibers and plastics.
In September 2010, Gevo acquired a Luverne, Minnesota ethanol production facility, and expects to begin commercial production of isobutanol there in the first half of 2012.
The company is now trading on NASDAQ as GEVO. Shares were up 11% at mid-day trading following the IPO.

806,"Blue Marble Energy Raises $1.3 Million More To Make Carbon-Neutral Fragrances, Flavors And Fuel",https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/08/blue-marble-energy-1-3-million-investment/,2011/02/08," According to a new SEC filing, Blue Marble Energy attracted another $1.3 million investment — this time in a series A-1 convertible note deal — to create carbon neutral alternatives to petrochemicals.
Blue Marble’s biochemicals can be used to manufacture everything from food and perfume, to plastics, adhesives and synthetic textiles. The company also produces renewable energy from biomass.
One of the company’s best known products is its perfume line, EOS, made partly with spent beer brewery grain from Freemont Brewing in conjunction with the hand-made fragrance retailers Sweet Anthem.
According to the company’s website:


“[Blue Marble]’s process uses organic material (biomass) including: food by-products, yard clippings, spent brewery grain, algae, milfoil, corn silage, wood chips, and more.
The company’s proprietary AGATE (Acid, Gas, and Ammonia Targeted Extraction) polyculture fermentation technology…uses non-genetically modified bacteria to produce target compounds. [This process] links several kinds of bacteria in a production chain to breakdown plant material. The…bacteria symbiotically works to produce a broad portfolio of compounds.”

In late 2009, the Seattle clean tech company struck a partnership with the Odessa Public Development Authority (OPDA) to construct and run Washington state’s first specialty biochemical biorefinery. The joint project attracted a $2 million award from Washington State’s Community Economic Revitalization Board (CERB). The plant is now moving out of its pilot phase towards a higher-volume, commercial phase.
In April 2009, the company raised its series A investment of $2 million from an entrepreneur involved in bottling and distributing sodas in Africa, Rajiv Shah who holds a seat on Blue Marble’s board.

807,"As Non-Proliferation Treaty Takes Effect, Should Nukes Be Seen As Clean Energy Source?",https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/07/converting-nukes-to-power/,2011/02/07," This weekend, a ratified nuclear arms control treaty between Russia and the United States went into effect, reducing and limiting each nation’s allowable arsenal of nuclear weapons. The new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START 2) also allows U.S. inspectors access to monitor Russian nuclear weapons technology, facilities and forces, which they were prevented from doing since the original START treaty expired in December 2009. As the nations attempt to mitigate a global nuclear arms race, questions remain: what can be done with extant, surplus and aging nukes? Can they be used as a source of clean energy? Do we have the technology?
According to a report by Joshua Pollack in the US Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists:

“[Russia has] approximately 12,000 nuclear warheads — about 2,600 of them deployed with “strategic” missiles and bombers capable of crossing the oceans — [and so] remains the sole force on Earth that could terminate the existence of the United States on any given day. America has its own massive nuclear arsenal to threaten Russia in return: about 9,400 warheads, including almost 2,000 deployed with strategic delivery systems…”
The World Nuclear Association, a nuclear industry trade group, not surprisingly suggests the conversion of nuclear weapons to energy. The establishment of power plants that can use weapons-grade plutonium and uranium, of course, could help the nuclear industry gain jobs and dollars in energy generation wherever it loses jobs in defense.
Even Bill Gates, who has invested in several energy technology businesses from TerraPower to Neos GeoSolutions, believes in reusing nuclear fuel for energy. TerraPower is trying to build a mini-reactor that could use spent nuclear fuel to power homes and offices, helping divert nuclear waste from storage sites. At his 2010 TED Talks lecture on energy, he noted: “A molecule of uranium has a million times more energy than a molecule of coal.”
Some still argue that the expense to build plants that can convert highly enriched uranium or nuclear weapons to commercial power is not commercially justifiable. Others believe nuclear power, from any sources, is not as clean and safe as other options, like solar or wind.
Clean energy entrepreneurs, who are vying for the support of government and other large investors, often reject the idea of calling nuclear a “clean” energy, thanks to a huge number of accidents on the U.S. historical record alone from Los Alamos to Hanford. That said, nuclear power does not produce carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, or nitrogen oxides.

Health and environmental risks associated with life near nuclear reactors include: contaminated and over-heated ground water; increased risk of childhood leukemia; increased cancer risks overall; and in some areas, decreased air quality from steam emissions; as well as the threat of a nuclear accident.
Platts reports on Monday noted the Sellafield MOX plant in the United Kingdom — established to blend plutonium and uranium oxides into nuclear fuel for commercial power generation — has thus far failed to deliver the energy output its builders promised, and cost the country more money than anticipated.
According to the website of the National Nuclear Security Administration, the U.S. is building a similar plant at the Department of Energy’s Savannah River Site near Aiken, South Carolina, due to become operational in 2016.

808,Everblue.edu Poised To Become The Kaplan Test Prep Of Sustainability,https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/05/everblue-edu-accreditation/,2011/02/05,"Everblue Training (Everblue.edu) — an environmental education startup with offices in Berkeley, Calif. and Charlotte, N.C. — this week attained accreditation from the group that verifies the quality of non-collegiate, continuing education and professional training programs throughout the United States for the U.S. Department of Education, the Accrediting Council for Continuing Education.
Principal and co-founder of Everblue, Jon Boggiano, says the endorsement allows his business to sell its services to: government veterans’ education programs helping them adjust back to civilian life; large companies that seek to train and certify their employees in a variety of environmental topics; and professionals or students who use government grants and loans to afford their continuing education. All of the company’s customers prior to its accreditation paid out-of-pocket.
Boggiano explained that he and his brother, Chris, a co-founder (along with Grant McGregor) are both veterans hoping to make the U.S. more energy independent, and to prepare the domestic workforce to remain technologically competitive. The duo also worked in the field of test-prep, helping business school hopefuls get ready for the GMAT (Graduate Management Admission Test) prior to founding Everblue.

With about twenty full-time employees, and fifty contract instructors, Everblue now teaches about 25,000 students per year, combining both classroom-and-online, and all-online courses.”Generally, people come for short-term boot camp type training. Most of the students in the classroom are architects, municipal officials, or anyone who has a hand in designing for communities. They’re collegiate up to retirees,” Jon Boggiano explained.
Everblue courses cover the following topics and certifications: Building Performance Institute  (BPI) Certifications, Weatherization Training; the Residential Energy Services Network’s Home Energy Ratings System (RESNET HERS); the U.S. Green Building Council’s certification of LEED certifications; the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners’ Solar Certification, Corporate Sustainability, and Carbon Accounting.
To build its content, Everblue used the open source course management system Moodle, Drupal and Articulate software, among other technologies. In 2010, the 5 percent of students who completed Everblue courses used the purely online services. Boggiano says he expects that number to grow to represent 20 percent by the end of 2011.
The company currently partners with 60 schools and trade associations to deliver its coursework broadly. It plans to soon deliver multiple language editions of its online coursework to students in China, the Middle East and Europe, and to add more game-like and immersive features to its digital courses, Boggiano said.

809,"New GroundLink App Lets Travelers Book A Green Limo, Shuttle or Car Service",https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/04/new-groundlink-app-green-vehicle/,2011/02/04," GroundLink — a New York City transportation technology and travel services business — released a new mobile app this week. The second iPhone app from the company, GroundLink allows users to book a hybrid, electric or otherwise clean-vehicle car, shuttle or limo to get around cities around the world.
Users can also opt to book a ride by lowest price, highest service rating or soonest and nearest available driver with the app. The company’s chief executive Alex Mashinsky noted:

“Over 5,000 of our [transportation] providers offer green vehicles – all forms, including hydrogen fleets in Los Angeles, even. It’s not all hybrids and electrics. Some countries have promoted natural gas vehicles.
That said, we let the customer choose by their own preferences. If they want an SUV, a stretch limo or whatever, they can book that service, too.”

Mashinsky expects to see the user-base for his company’s phone apps grow in travel hubs in the U.S. and Europe, rapidly. GroundLink’s goal is to have 10% of its overall bookings being taken on smartphones by the end of the year, increasing to over 25% by 2013. It plans to release an Android app in March.
 In late January, GroundLink struck a partnership with the travel search engine, KAYAK hoping to reach new audiences online and on mobile networks.
KAYAK now uses a GroundLink API to offer a ground transportation marketplace within its own applications. Overall, GroundLink’s service covers some 5,000 airports, 15,000 cities and 45,000 providers of ground transportation related services, today.
If it takes off in the Bay Area market, the GroundLink app could prove a competitive threat to Uber, the sometimes controversial California startup that also offers driver-booking services via iPhone.
As with Uber GroundLink users can view a map that shows a vehicle’s whereabouts in real-time, once it is booked and en route to a pick-up. Users can also share a map showing their whereabouts and progress towards a destination (Loopt-style) with authorized friends, family, colleagues, or employees.
Avoiding some problems that Uber encountered with the incumbent taxi industry and its regulators around San Francisco, GroundLink books rides through a central dispatch system that company representatives say is controlled by a local base, and authorized by relevant regional and national transportation authorities.
GroundLink deals with taxis but does not focus on or make revenue from sending business to taxi dispatchers at this time, nor does it advertise itself as a cab-hailing service. If users want an immediate taxi service, they can access a list of dispatchers in the area through GroundLink, which refers users to book through the dispatchers, directly.
Instead, GroundLink bills itself as the OpenTable of ground transportation, a reservations system and marketplace that lets travelers book a limo, car or shuttle ride within 30 minutes’ notice in the U.S., or in the world on 1 hour notice, seeing a price for the ride before they book it.

810,Earth Aid Raises $4 Million For Home Energy Management Platform,https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/03/earth-aid-raises-4-million-for-home-energy-management-platform/,2011/02/03,"Home energy management platform Earth Aid has raised $4 million in Series A funding from Point Judith Capital, the Clean Energy Venture Group, and Capital-E.
Similar to EnergySavvy, Google’s Powermeter and Microsoft’s Hohm, Earth Aid provides consumers with information on how much electricity, water, and natural gas they use and how much they spend on these utilities.
Earth Aid’s proprietary technology grabs the data directly from electric, gas and water utilities (with your permission), without requiring users to download software or install hardware. The application will then compare how much energy and water you consume to the same month a year ago, and will also show you comparisons of consumption with neighbors in your residential areas.
Earth Aid adds a slight twist to home energy management by rewarding users as they consume less energy and water. Users earn reward points which which are redeemable at local and national businesses (i.e. Dove, Starbucks and Breyers). The company also sells equipment to help make your house more energy efficient. Since launching, tens of thousands of households in every state in the U.S. are already actively using the Earth Aid platform, says the company.
The new funding will be used towards hiring additional employees and new product development; Earth Aid plans to release an enterprise-focused platform in March.

811,"Ascent Solar, Makers of Thin Film Modules, Get Distributors In Singapore, Malaysia, Greece",https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/03/ascent-solar-new-distribution-deals/,2011/02/03,"  Colorado-based Ascent Solar Technologies (NASDAQ: ASTI) — the makers of flexible, thin film modules under the brand name WaveSol — scored a distribution deal with Cyprus-based SW Solarwatt Ltd. the companies announced today.
The news follows another distribution deal for Ascent Solar, with Polymer Sun a company that will resell its thin film products to solar power systems installers in Singapore and Malaysia.
Government support for the development of solar power systems and business looks strong in both markets.
Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou frequently touts clean energy developments — like a recently proposed 200 megawatt (MW) capacity solar park that will cost some 600 million euros (more than $800 million) to build atop a spent coal mine — as a way to create jobs, and alleviate pollution in the debt and unemployment burdened country.
The Financial Times noted in late January:
Greece has lagged behind Spain and Italy in developing photovoltaic installations in spite of offering subsidies for renewables investments, because of long drawn-out licensing procedures.

Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is also a proponent of solar power and clean energy in general. According to reports by Channel News Asia, Singapore’s strategy to grow the sector has been:


“To attract high-value investments in manufacturing and build strong research and development capabilities. [This includes] training over 2,000 specialists over the next five years.”

Ascent Solar did not respond immediately to questions about the potential revenue growth from its two, new distributor deals.

812,"Turning One Company's Trash Into Another's Treasure, RecycleMatch Brings Site Out Of Beta, Hires New CEO",https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/02/recyclematch-new-ceo/,2011/02/02," Today, RecycleMatch — a Houston-based startup that helps businesses sell or give away stuff to recyclers and manufacturers so that they don’t have to send it to a landfill — took its online marketplace out of beta, unveiling several new features and services.
If the site performs as hoped, RecycleMatch could become the Alibaba, eBay or Amazon of waste-management and manufacturing, while helping just about any company improve its sustainability profile.
Among the materials RecycleMatch helps businesses take out of the landfill-bound waste stream are: “commodity recyclables” including paper, steel, plastic and glass; wastewater; consumer electronics and business equipment (a.k.a. e-waste); and food waste.
How do you “recycle” food waste, exactly? [ed: Besides throwing overripe tomatoes around in Valencia, Spain’s famous annual Tomato Battle…] One soup maker uses RecycleMatch to sell its wasted product to renewable energy companies that purchase or pick it up to turn it into biofuel.
The startup, whose offices are in Houston and Austin, recently attained a series A investment from a fund that it hasn’t yet revealed, and is putting the undisclosed capital towards sales and marketing, as well as website development. A few months ago, RecycleMatch brought on a new chief executive, Chris Porch, a serial entrepreneur who earlier worked in c-suite levels positions at Zag.com and BetweenMarkets, other online marketplace businesses.

RecycleMatch founder, Brooke Farrell, spoke with TechCrunch about her inspiration to start this business (bringing on her brother-in-law Chad Farrell as co-founder) in the fall of 2009. The environmental and financial costs of sending business and industrial waste to landfills in the United States could be, and must be reduced she thought, while studying EPA data and tuning in to blogs and trades about trash and the environment.
She noted on Tuesday:

“For each one pound of waste generated by a consumer in the United States today, there are 60.31 lbs. of commercially generated manufacturing and industrial waste that were generated in the production of those goods. Companies pay on average, in the U.S. $45 per ton tipping fees to send that waste to landfills.”
The new RecycleMatch website features the following services for buyers and bidders of recyclable or re-usable materials:

1. Anonymous listings and messaging between buyers and bidders, that protects companies from revealing to the public what is in their waste stream.
2. Specialized bidding that…
a. lets buyers bid on materials, or find materials they need for free one time, or on a regular, weekly or monthly basis.
b. allows sellers to choose among bidders who offer the best price, or are in the most convenient location to arrange a pick-up, or have an intended use for the materials that the sellers can appreciate.
4. Reputation management system where buyers and sellers rate and are able to respond to one another, unlike the Yelp model. The reputation scores and reviews will be monitored by RecycleMatch’s customer service team.

Porch believes RecycleMatch will lower the cost of innovation in materials science and renewable energy. He said:

“When there was damage done to a big building in Houston after a hurricane, people could not deal with a lot of the glass waste, because of a particular kind of film that was on it. We matched the company [that had to clean up this glass] with another that took it, and crushed it to make countertops.
There are so many innovative ways to reuse materials instead of dumping them in a landfill. We make it possible for this to happen, across state lines, and in a way that’s affordable for all involved.”


With its new leadership and website in place, Farrell predicted:
“RecycleMatch should grow within orders of magnitude this year. Right now, we’re looking at several hundred listings on our site. We expect to see five or ten thousand listings within a year.”
Editor’s note:
A reader asks how RecycleMatch plans to make money. According to CEO Porch, RecycleMatch uses “a performance based business model.” The site and service is free for those who want to register and list materials for sale, and to those who bid as buyers.
The company charges 5% commission for material sold on the site. If material is given away free, RecycleMatch charges $5 a ton for whatever material is picked up by a “buyer.” Porch and Farrell said those listing materials on RecycleMatch save money by not paying tipping fees at landfills, which according to the company are on average, in the U.S., $45 per ton.

813,Boulder's eSpace Center Wants To Make Aerospace A Startup-Friendly Industry,https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/01/boulder-espace-incubator-3d-year/,2011/02/01," Private sector space tech companies — from Virgin Galactic to Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) — have been doing what only government agencies were empowered to do in earlier generations, launch vehicles into space, improve the fuel efficiency of aircraft, and more. A Boulder-based incubator called The eSpace Center for Space Entrepreneurship still thinks the industry could be friendlier to startups and innovators, though.
Founded in partnership with the University of Colorado, and with SNC as its lead sponsor, the eSpace incubator is currently seeking its third class of aerospace entrepreneurs, and reviewing applications on a rolling basis.
Diane Dimeff, executive director at the eSpace Center, says the incubator will: give financial grants of up to $20,000 in seed funding to selected startups, and match them with mentors who are chief executives of companies relevant to each new venture; also giving them office space in Boulder for up to 18 months; access to manufacturing facilities; and a network of contacts within government agencies and large corporations in the field.
The eSpace incubator program has supported nine companies so far, two of which have graduated and moved into professional offices, and three of which have environmental uses for their space technologies, Dimeff confirmed.
One of the clean- and space-tech businesses there now, TIGON EnerTec, is a University of Colorado spinout making light weight, hybrid propulsion systems for use in aircraft, boats and terrestrial vehicles. The company could be the Prius of the sky, seas, and streets if they succeed in commercializing their technology.

TIGON EnerTec’s chief executive, Les Makepace, told TechCrunch:
“In Boulder, there are a number of incubators affiliated with the schools here and various investor groups. One of the best known, TechStars, is a great program, but it’s pretty much software oriented. I wouldn’t have even tried to bring them this concept. And we became too mature to stay within university incubators at a point. So we were happy to learn about eSpace, which was really new when we applied.”

Contestants in the Google Lunar X PRIZE (who we wrote about recently, here) Next Giant Leap are also eSpace incubator alumni.

814,"Alphabet Energy's Waste-Heat Recovery Tech Is Out Of The Lab, Pilot Projects Underway",https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/01/alphabet-energy-pilots/,2011/02/01," A company that makes systems to turn waste-heat into electricity, Alphabet Energy has officially moved its technology out of the lab and into pilot production, the company announced today.
The company recently hired manufacturing technology veteran, Sylvain Muckenhirn, as their vice president of manufacturing. He will lead Alphabet Energy’s effort to begin fabless, volume manufacturing of its technology in time to deliver it to early customers in 2012 and 2013. The company also moved into San Francisco offices, and out of their early stage UC Berkeley space.
Founder and chief executive, Matt Scullin, confirmed that Alphabet Energy plans to sell its patented waste-heat recovery technology to businesses that generate lots of heat, but want to recapture it to create energy that they can use, in the following fields: automotive, military, heavy industry and power generation.
The startup has a number of pilot projects underway, but Scullin won’t say how many, where or with which forward-thinking clean tech customers, yet. The CEO also wouldn’t say whether Alphabet Energy’s systems are bigger than a breadbox or smaller than a Prius. He did say they are not micro-scale, meaning they won’t likely be used to turn heat from consumer electronics into a source of power for those electronics.
Scullin did tell TechCrunch a little bit about the cost of electricity he thinks Alphabet Energy can deliver through its systems:

“Once you install a thermal electric system like ours, which has no moving parts and doesn’t require fuel [editor’s note: like a Bloom Box might] you have almost no costs beyond the installation. We think we can offer levelized cost of electricity on the order of 3 cents per kilowatt hour. That’s cheap! It can get our customers return on investments within months instead of years, like solar and other installations.”
Nine months ago, Alphabet Energy secured a $1 million seed investment from Claremont Creek Ventures and the CalCEF Angel Fund. In the last two years it also attained $320,000 in Small Business Innovation Research grants and contracts from the U.S. Army, Air Force, and the Department of Energy.
A director at Claremont Creek Ventures, Paul Straub, said of Alphabet Energy:


“They’re going after a huge problem. As VCs, we look at investments that can be [in] billion dollar markets. What they’re trying to do, when you look at the global applications of it, could amount to a hundred billion dollar market.
One great thing about Alphabet Energy’s technology is that it uses very widely available material, and well understood manufacturing processes. Their underling discovery recognized thermoelectric properties in something familiar.
I’ve also never seen a company in our portfolio or in any portfolio developing physical product while being so capital efficient. They have a majority of their seed round left, nine months later, and have hit all the milestones they said they would.”  

Straub said CCV focuses on clean tech opportunities and startups that can make extraordinary progress with a small amount of seed funding, rather than requiring massive infrastructural change or huge subsidies in order to become profitable.
Alphabet Energy’s Scullin noted that U.S. federal support of waste-heat recovery is not nearly as strong as it is for other clean technologies, which have tax credits.
The Heat Is Power tax credit proposal — sponsored by representatives Paul Tonko, Jay Inslee, Shelly Berkley and Ron Paul — could change that if passed. According to Tonko’s website, the suggested legislation would establish:


“An investment tax credit for new innovative technology that produces clean, zero-emission electricity from waste heat generated by industrial processes… [that] would help stimulate growth in the waste heat to electricity market and create new jobs.”

815,Tale of Two Cities: Citigroup Commits $40 Million To Financing SolarCity Projects,https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/01/tale-of-two-cities-citigroup-commits-40-million-to-financing-solarcity-projects/,2011/02/01," SolarCity, a company that designs, installs and secures financing to put solar power generating systems in homes in North America, keeps reeling in the financial partners. This time, the San Mateo, Calif.-based startup convinced Citigroup to finance $40 million in U.S.-based home solar projects in 2011, a representative from Citigroup confirmed.
The chief executive of Solar City, Lyndon Rive, explained the significance of his company’s new financial partner:


“Over the last year, we entered into the residential solar financing business. But $40 million is on the smaller side of deals we have, actually. Funds [from our partners] range from $40 million up to more than $100 million.
When you have a global player like Citigroup, it is not easy for them to take a new initiative, to turn the boat, if you will. We’re very excited that they chose SolarCity as a first entry into the space.
We hope to see them do more of this [kind of clean energy financing] once they have some time to experiment, see the results and deploy more.” 

Since mid-2008, SolarCity attained 12 funding deals like this, with over half of those from financial partners’ coming back with larger amounts, to repeat business.
Ben Cook, vice president of project finance at SolarCity, noted that his company’s performance data is its “secret weapon” in convincing banks to become clean tech investors in this manner.


“Financial institutions are concerned with risk and defaults of course. They want to know if the systems work. Our systems provide 5 to 8 percent more power than we estimated, we’re finding, in terms of kilowatt hours. That leads to happy customers. As far as the default rate? 99.9% of our customers pay on time.”

SolarCity competes with a range of other solar installers who offer financing options, like the SolarUniverse franchise for residential projects, or Greenbridge Energy Consortium for commercial and institutional projects.
So far, Citigroup is only working with SolarCity in residential solar financing.

816,"Recyclebank's CEO Jonathan Hsu On New Site, Rewarding Green Behavior Beyond The Bin",https://techcrunch.com/2011/02/01/recyclebank-ceo-hsu-on-site-redesig/,2011/02/01,"Recyclebank — a loyalty rewards program that encourages people to lower the environmental impact of their lifestyles, for example, by recycling more and tossing less — introduced a redesigned website and mobile apps, and began offering new services to customers and partners on Monday.
Chief executive of Recyclebank, Jonathan Hsu, said some of the new features he’s excited about, include:

1. “Learn and earn” quizzes that give RecycleBank users a small number of redeemable points for correctly answering questions about ecology, energy and the like.
2. Local search capabilities, encouraging users to do more “green” things around their communities, or to buy from more green service providers and suppliers near their homes, for points.
3. Rewards from more local, small-to-medium sized businesses, so members can cash in points for a discount at a sustainable grocer or dry cleaner within their zip code, not just redeem points for freebies and discounts from large chains.
4. Facebook, Twitter and further mobile integrations that let RecycleBank users interact with  or access the site’s content and features via their iPhones and iPads now, and in coming quarters their Android devices.


Hsu recently completed his first 100 days as CEO at Recyclebank. The New York City startup is venture-backed by Kleiner Perkins, RRE Ventures and Sigma Partners, and was originally founded by Ron Gonen [editor’s note: to a commenter’s point, Gonen was the startup’s original CEO, and worked with co-founder Patrick FitzGerald to start the company]. Hsu said that the site and its new features hint at some of the changes to come for Recyclebank, overall:

“Today, Recyclebank is an innovative program to increase recycling in over 300 cities in the U.S. and U.K. The site redesign is all about the member experience. [It will] let members see their impact from recycling, and a number of other sustainable and community enhancing behaviors, beyond that, now. It helps people understand the context of their actions and where they fit in the world.”
With the ramped up search and content, the company stands to double its advertising and sponsorship revenue within two years. Hsu confirmed about 10 percent of RecycleBank’s revenue comes from ads and sponsored content now, and that even at maturity, it won’t likely comprise more than 25 percent.
Recyclebank’s move to offer points to users who implement energy efficiency measures at home — whether that’s by installing solar panels, turning off the lights more frequently, or insulating their homes better — could spell competition for other startups in the green consumer web space, from OPOWER to EnergySavvy.
Hsu says, however, he envisions Recyclebank as an agnostic provider of rewards programs to motivate and reward environmentally sound behavior, and help other companies do the same.

The CEO explained:

“In order to make a real impact, and move what’s going on in our communities and environment in a better direction, we have to collaborate with one another rather than compete.
Here’s an example, some waste haulers have their own incentive programs [editor’s note: like Waste Management’s Greenopolis]. However, we still work with three of the largest waste haulers in the world, Waste Connections, Republic, and Veolia.
In energy, there are a lot of individual device makers — including smart meter and solar companies — who have approached us to offer their products within our rewards catalog, to reach new members through our service and turn them into customers. Even more of them have asked us to allow their businesses to utilize our green currency to incent people to go ahead and make purchases [so they’ll earn points for using the devices over time].
Now, we’re lead generating for energy businesses, and motivating people through incentives around more than recycling. We are already working with Efficiency 2.0, but also hope to work directly with utilities like Duke Energy on this.”

Today, only a small amount of the company’s revenue comes from companies paying to offer green points to RecycleBank users, or “affiliate commerce.” Hsu says that should come to comprise the largest piece of Recyclebank’s business, over time.
The bulk of the company’s revenue currently comes from municipalities and waste hauler partners who pay Recyclebank a percentage of increased savings they generate by diverting trash from the waste stream to the recycling stream per city or campus.

817,33Needs Brings Crowdsourced Funding To Social Startups,https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/31/33needs/,2011/01/31,"
The crowdsourced funding craze is picking up steam.  Tonight we see the launch of 33needs, a site where socially-minded startups can raise initial seed funding from individual contributors on the Web.  It is Kiva meets Kickstarter.
Social startups post their “needs” in terms of how much money they are looking to raise, what problems they are going to solve and how they are going to do it, along with a video to help spread the word virally.  People can invest $10, $100, $1,000 or more, and in return instead of getting shares in the company, they get a promised percentage of revenues for a specified period of time like 5 percent of revenues for three years.
The startups seeking funds are for-profit ventures, as is 33needs.  Some of the launch startups include Emergent Energy Group, which wants to bring renewable energy projects to different communities in the U.S., and HalfUnited, a new clothing company which feeds hungry children with part of its profits (see video below).
33needs itself takes a 5 percent cut of any money raised, and nothing if the goal is not met. Generally, thee social startups are trying to raise anywhere from $50,000 or more get their businesses off the ground.  They all try to mix profits with creating social good, which increasingly also resonates as a marketing strategy to consumers who want to feel like they are making a difference in the world.  Whether or not they actually are is a different matter, but the most enduring social startups will end up being those who create a measurable impact.
The company was founded by Josh Tetrick, a social entrepreneur and former Fulbright Scholar who worked in Africa and for President Clinton.  He doesn’t see 33needs as a replacement for angel or seed capital, but rather as a launching pad for ideas that may otherwise never have made it beyond a dinner conversation.  “It’s a launching pad that builds fans, breeds a loyal base of people who’ll buy your stuff and use your product,” he argues.  “There is so much pent up demand to invest in this stuff—not donate, but invest.”
But using crowdfunding to help start companies, as opposed to microloans for projects (Kickstarter) or people (Kiva), sets a higher bar.  These require more money than a simple project.  One of the key learnings from Kickstarter, for instance, is that small projects can grow into full-blown startups, but they don’t have to (watch this interview with Kickstarter founder Perry Chen).  With 33needs it will be all or nothing.  So the startups better make their pitches really good.

818,"Power-One Opens First U.S. Factory To Make Inverters, Turn Renewables To Grid Ready Electricity",https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/31/power-one-phoenix-factory/,2011/01/31," Power-One, Inc. (NASDAQ:PWER) — a large manufacturer of power inverters for the renewable energy industry and provider of software to manage power harvesting and distribution — opened its first North American manufacturing facility in Phoenix today, where they plan to employ 350 people full-time.
According to a company press statement, the facility will primarily produce photovoltaic and wind inverters that convert renewable energy into a usable form of electricity for distribution on the utility grid. The chief executive of Power-One, Richard J. Thompson, explained ahead of the facility’s opening ceremony on Monday:


“We have manufacturing design centers, service centers and a sales force in Europe, the U.S. and Asia, now. Europe has been where the largest percent of our revenue comes from, some 90 percent today. At the beginning of 2010, we started creating product for U.S. customers who may have [made-in-America requirements] and fielding a sales force and developing a service organization here. This is a continued geographic expansion to bring our technology and services to the U.S. market. ”

The company scouted sites in the “sun belt” states, and specifically looked at Texas, Mississippi and California along with Arizona. They chose Phoenix for this facility, Thompson confirmed, due to: availability of technical resources and talent thanks to the proximity of Arizona State University, and grants from local government that are tied to employment in the area over the long run.

Power-One is facing different market conditions in the U.S. where about half the demand for its inverter technology comes from residential and commercial buyers, the other half from utilities, and where government incentives to develop renewable energy generating projects have not been strong as they have been in Canada, Germany and elsewhere.
As such, Thompson explained:


“The Phoenix facility will enable us to do many things, including introduce a new line of products towards the third quarter of 2011, like a liquid cool set of inverters for utilities.
We’ll also have a Power-One research and development center in Phoenix that will add some 35 graduate engineers and technicians in addition to our manufacturing headcount over the next two years.
We’re also strongly considering manufacturing at this site for export. That was not in our plans earlier. But we like the efficiency we’re seeing out of this factory, so far, from a small sample. We’ve had about 40 folks there in manufacturing so far.”

Power-One competitors include Emerson Network Power (NYSE: EMR) based in St. Louis, Missouri, and the strongly venture-backed Enphase Energy, which recently announced plans to triple its capacity and start selling its inverters in Europe.

819,"Unirac, Canadian Solar To Build 30 Megawatts Of Renewable Energy In Ontario",https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/31/unirac-can-solar-30mw-deal/,2011/01/31,"Unirac — a company that makes racks that are used to install and hold solar panels in place within power generating systems of any size — today revealed a new partnership with solar tech manufacturers, Canadian Solar Inc. (nasdaq: CSIQ).
Through the partnership, the companies will install 30 MW of solar projects in Canada, starting with a 10.9 MW solar park in Napanee, Ontario. According to a Unirac press statement, Canadian Solar will serve as the engineering, procurement and construction entity on these projects, and Unirac will provide the racking infrastructure.
In May 2010, Albuquerque, N.M.-based Unirac sold to Hilti Group, a massive construction sector business. Before it became a wholly owned subsidiary of Hilti, Unirac’s sales increased 100% from 2009 to 2010 said the chief executive of Unirac, Doug May.
He sees tremendous growth ahead for U.S. based solar companies, especially those serving domestic power companies with made-in-America products, yet have capacity to export:

“The U.S. [solar market] was around 800 megawatts this year, and could grow to 2.5 gigawatts. We’re slated for growth, near-term. The utility market alone next year, could be the same size as the entire U.S. market was this past year,” May said. 
Today, 90 percent of Unirac’s supply chain is in the U.S. — most of its aluminum, for example, is extruded in California — but it gets 10 percent of its supplies from Canada, Europe and Asia.
Since 2009, the company also began building manufacturing, assembly and shipping operations outside of New Mexico, to be closer to customers and take advantage of government incentives in other states and countries, when possible.
Unirac specifically established manufacturing operations in Canada, anticipating a boom in solar project building thanks to the country’s feed-in-tariffs and other incentives.
Subsidized or not, May believes that Unirac’s products can solve problems for those who hesitated to build solar power generating systems due to labor costs, before. He explained:

“Solar projects for large utilities take a long time to get approved, with so many transmission and environmental challenges to be dealt with. They are all massive construction projects.
When it comes to the cost of solar power, people always want to talk about module efficiency. That is important. But the racking has to last for twenty years, too.
If you have workers who have to put a bolt in, or who have to go back down to the ground over and over again to build these projects, it’s going to drive up the costs of solar overall. We think about that.
We put a huge amount of testing into understanding code, snow loads, wind loads, what the ground is doing, and all the factors that influence the racking and ultimately the solar [power generating] systems. Even though we’re not making the panels, it’s highly technical.
Ultimately, it’s about taking the cost out of solar projects at any scale and making renewable energy competitive.”

Unirac was backed by the Maryland-based, private equity group Global Environment Fund prior to its acquisition by Hilti. Competing manufacturers of racking equipment for the solar industry include Zep Solar, also a partner of Canadian Solar, and Sollega, which offers one rack made of recycled materials.

820,"All Electric Bike Makers, Zero Motorcycles, Raise Another $2.4 Million",https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/28/zero-motorcycles-raise-2million/,2011/01/28," A Santa Cruz-based electric motorcycle manufacturer, Zero Motorcycles, raised another $2.4 million in private equity, according to a new SEC filing.
Earlier this month, California’s Scotts Valley Police Department started using the company’s Zero DS bikes in urban patrols. According to a company press statement, its Zero DS has a range of up to 50 miles (80 km) and is highway legal, safe for off-road bike paths, and drives quietly due to its all-electric drivetrain, making it potentially advantageous for urban law enforcement.
In late 2010, Zero Motorcycles expanded sales of its all-electric bikes to Australia. The company is selling its products in 32 countries today, including the U.S., Switzerland, Germany, Italy, the U.K. and Canada.
Last summer, Zero Motorcycles attained a U.S. patent for a battery interconnect system that reduces the amount energy wasted in the form of heat around the power packs that go into their bikes.

Zero’s competitors include fellow American startups Brammo and Mission Motors, and major bike companies like Honda and BMW that have committed to put out all-electric models, too.
In 2008, Zero Motorcycles raised about $8 million, and in 2010 the company raised another $7.1 million in what appear to be several expansion rounds, bringing the company’s total equity raised to about $17.5 million today.
TechCrunch has requested details about how Zero Motorcycles will apply its latest financing round of $2.4 million. The company did not offer an immediate reply.

821,"Avego Debuts go520 Mobile App In Seattle To Encourage Carpooling, Ease Traffic",https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/27/seattle-avego-go520-carpool-app/,2011/01/27," A company that provides software and services to the transportation industry, Avego, introduced a pilot program called go520 in Seattle today, to match drivers who have empty seats in their vehicles to carpoolers on their route, using an app for iPhone and other GPS-enabled smartphones.
The project could do for commuters what Cabulous and Uber have begun to do for taxi drivers and their potential customers — make it easy to find one another, while hopefully curbing pollution and traffic congestion when there are too many single-car drivers on the road.
A Washington state -funded project, the go520 app and service allows up to 250 drivers to offer empty seats in their vehicles to 750 riders along Seattle’s SR 520 highway. Drivers require an iPhone; passengers can use any mobile phone with texting capabilities to access the service. The company will make a Windows Phone 7 version available in April 2011.

To encourage participation in the project, Avego will give go520 drivers who use their program 20 or more times each month a $30 gas card, and some other travel reimbursements. Riders will receive up to $30 per month in Avego credits to use towards travel beyond the program covered by the go520 initiative.
Washington state has sought to decrease emissions and reduce traffic around Seattle’s highways with a number of other approaches including: the installation of ramp meters, new tolling, bus services and web-based carpool services.
According to an Avego press statement:
In 2009, the Washington State Legislature required the state’s transportation department to conduct a carpool pilot project on the SR 520 corridor in King County. The pilot project includes a detailed evaluation of real-time [carpooling] to help policy makers determine how it compares to other demand management programs and whether it should be used elsewhere in Washington. WSDOT considered a variety of proposals and selected Avego to receive a $400,000 grant.

In December, Avego attained $5.6 million in series A funding in a round led by SOSventures.

822,"Hovensa Petroleum Refinery To Pay $5.3 Million Fine, Invest $700 Million In Pollution Controls",https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/26/hovensa-clean-air-violation-settlement/,2011/01/26," The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Department of Justice announced today that Hovensa LLC — a joint venture between Hess Corporation and Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. — will pay a civil penalty of more than $5.3 million, and spend more than $700 million in new pollution controls as part of a settlement resulting from a complaint about Clean Air Act violations by the company at its St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands refinery.
According to the government-filed complaint, Hovensa made changes to its petroleum refinery that increased its emissions, after having failed to obtain pre-construction permits, and failing to install required pollution control equipment there.
The proposed settlement requires the company to spend $700 million on upgrading its refinery business with: new and upgraded pollution controls, more stringent emission limits, and aggressive monitoring, leak-detection and repair practices to reduce emissions from refinery equipment and process units. The settlement is subject to a 30-day public comment period and court approval.
Once fully implemented, the EPA statement says:


“Pollution controls required by the settlement are estimated to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) by more than 5,000 tons per year and sulfur dioxide (SO2) by nearly 3,500 tons per year. The settlement will also result in additional reductions of volatile organic compounds, particulate matter, carbon monoxide and other pollutants that affect air quality. Additional pollution-reducing projects at the refinery’s coking unit under the settlement will also reduce greenhouse gas emissions by over 6,100 tons per year.
High concentrations of SO2 and NOx, two key pollutants emitted from refineries, can have adverse impacts on human health, and are significant contributors to acid rain, smog, and haze.”

The government’s settlement with Hovensa is the 28th under an EPA initiative to improve compliance among petroleum refiners, and reduce significant amounts of air pollution from refineries in the U.S. that has been ongoing since 2000, and has impacted 105 refineries operating in 32 states and territories – more than 90 percent of the total refining capacity in the United States.
As a result of the total of settlement agreements in the past eleven years, the EPA reports, refiners have agreed to invest about $6 billion in new pollution controls designed to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and other pollutants by over 360,000 tons per year.
According to a report earlier this month in the Virgin Islands Daily News, Hovensa raised its wholesale gasoline prices (or “rack rate”) across the board for the fourth month in a row in January, bringing wholesale rates to their highest level since October 2008, leading to a spike in retail prices for gasoline across the territory, and beyond. U.S. retail gasoline prices have been climbing steadily since September 2010, according to data compiled by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
How much do you think the cost of compliance contributes to those rates?

823,"Metabolix Oilseeds Gets $203,000 Grant To Test 'False Flax' As Possible Petroleum Replacement",https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/26/metabolix-oilseeds-gets-203000-grant-to-test-false-flax-as-possible-petroleum-replacement/,2011/01/26," A Cambridge, Mass. biosciences company that makes plastics, chemicals and energy from renewable crops rather than petroleum, Metabolix, Inc. (NASDAQ: MBLX) today announced that its subsidiary, Metabolix Oilseeds, obtained a $203,000 grant from the Saskatchewan Ministry of Agriculture (or USD $203,614.92) to test a crop called Camelina Sativa, or false flax, as a possible petroleum replacement.
Camelina contains oil, fiber and protein with potential uses in nutrition for people and animals, and industrial applications including in biofuels.
Previously, Metabolix, Inc. attained 22 grants* from the U.S. government totaling $11.3 million since 2001 — including in 2009, a $349,450 award from the USDA Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES) — to make bioplastics that could replace HDPE, a petroleum-based variety used in bottles and containers, made on commercial scale equipment and at rapid manufacturing speeds.
According to the company’s website, Mirel resin is biodegradable in soil and water, and in home and industrial composting facilities but not in a conventional landfill, and is used in lieu of traditional plastics to make consumer goods, compost bags, business equipment and packaging. It’s also FDA-approved for use in microwaveable, freez-able, and food, medical and cosmetic packaging.
While Metabolix is viewed as an industry leader, competition for a piece of the sustainable packaging market is growing with companies like Biopack Environmental Solutions, Crown Holdings, EnviroPAK, NatureWorks, Pactiv, and many other stalwarts strongly in the game, and startups like EcoSpan and MicroGreen growing quickly.
The global market for sustainable packaging (not just bioplastics) is projected to reach $142.42 billion by 2015, according to projections by Global Industry Analysts (GIA).
Metabolix is also developing technology to make plastics, chemicals and energy, from crops such as switchgrass, oilseeds and sugarcane on the same equipment, or in the same facilities.
*CORRECTION ADDED TH. JAN. 27, 2011:  
This story previously said Metabolix, Inc. had attained a $15 million grant. That number was from an estimate by a trade news site, and was inaccurate. According to USA Spending, a U.S. government website, Metabolix has attained 22 U.S. government grants totaling $11.3 million since 2001. The grant it attained in 2009 from the U.S.D.A. was a $349,450 award. I regret the error.

824,"Abound Solar, Thin-Film Panel Makers, Ready To Cross The Pond",https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/25/aboundsolar-certs-uk-expansion/,2011/01/25," Abound Solar, which makes thin-film cadmium telluride solar panels, has attained certifications that will allow the company to receive feed-in tariffs in the U.K. and pursue sales there aggressively.
With a feed-in tariff, utilities agree to pay a premium, but stable, rate for power generated from renewable sources, both as the utility uses the power, or as it is fed back through the grid to be redistributed and sold elsewhere.
Often controversial, feed-in tariff are meant to drive the rapid adoption of clean energy by homeowners and utilities alike. Critics believe they give a better payout to utilities, and hurt consumers, or that they tip the scales in favor of one technology (like solar) over others (such as wind, or geothermal) unfairly.
Solar subsidies in France, Bloomberg reported last week, led to an all-out boom in the installation of residential solar systems, and then to government debt. The agency that guaranteed premium rates for solar generated power can’t cover as much as installed systems have begun to produce at the locked-in, higher-than-market rates according to the report. As a result, the country is cutting the incentives, and that could hurt solar companies that have heavily invested, there.
A similar thing happened to the solar market in Spain around 2008, according to a report by analyst Stephen Marcus for Cleantech Group. Japan is currently considering cutting down its solar feed-in tarrifs now, too PV-Tech reported today. A decision there is due in February.
Abound Solar’s modules previously received certifications from Underwriters Laboratories (UL) and the California Energy Commission (CEC) which helped the company to gather momentum, domestically. The company manufactures its technology in Indiana, having recently secured a federal loan guarantee of $400 million to build its operations there in a facility that once made auto transmissions.
To date, Abound Solar (formerly known as AVA Solar) has raised $150 million from private investors and institutions, including: Invus Group, DCM, Bohemian Companies, Technology Partners, GLG Partners, and the Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Program.
Mark Chen, a director of marketing and product manager at Abound Solar, said on Tuesday:
“We have no immediate projects in the pipeline in the U.K. but are optimistic about our market potential there, as the government is highly supportive of solar. We will follow some of our existing customers there from Germany, Italy and the U.S. including probably Juwi Solar and WirSol both German companies.”

825,Solar Universe Raises $7 Million To Franchise Solar Installation,https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/25/solar-universe-series-b/,2011/01/25," Solar Universe — a company building a franchise of solar installers across North America — raised a $7 million series b investment led by RockPort Capital, the company announced today. Abe Yokell, a principal with RockPort is joining the Livermore, California company’s board.
The founder and chief executive of Solar Universe, Joe Bono, said he was able to lock in the investment because: “Unlike our competitors, [our business] requires very little capital to scale, a fact that we have proven by consistently performing to plan, and achieving our goals quarter after quarter.”
Solar Universe competitors, like SolarCity — which won The 2010 Best Clean Tech Crunchies Award — or  Sungevity, generate revenue directly from customers, providing services like: energy efficiency audits for homes, project quotes, solar power systems design, financing help, installation and monitoring.
Much like any other franchise, 7-Eleven to Ritz Carlton, Solar Universe generates revenue instead by getting would-be business owners to pay a franchise fee, then to set up shop under its brand umbrella. The company in turn helps franchisees train, generate leads, market their services, distribute solar products, attain financing help for solar projects that their customers want, and provides software to manage their businesses. But the end-product is delivered by the franchisee, which can make quality control a challenge in general.
 Bono says his company’s most advanced offering is not a clean technology, but: “[Our] end to end software platform that covers all major areas of the solar installation business: lead capture, proposal generation, front & back office functions, permit assembly, invoicing, financing through partners and customer loyalty.”
With its new found capital and franchise approach, Solar Universe hired Kevin Daughtery  to run its supply chain, quality control and operations, and Laurie Anthony Baggio to grow its franchisee and installer network, develop new markets and  channel partnerships. Daughtery worked previously as SolarCity’s vice president of operations. Baggio was a vice president of franchise development and COO of 1-800-GOT-JUNK? the paid, waste-haulers and recyclers.
Bono said the company expects to hire no more than 20 additional people in the next 2 quarters. Solar Universe’s two dozen solar franchises are currently operating in: California, Nevada, Arizona, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Louisiana. On average, Bono said, each of his company’s 800 customers have generated 1100 kilowatt hours on average, monthly, from Solar Universe installations. In other words, his company helps generate 880 megawatt hours of solar each month.
The company also plans to use its capital to reel in would-be solar installation business owners and contractors to its network.
While quality control can prove challenging for franchisors in any field, green and clean tech companies are joining Solar Universe in their approach, for example: Dr. Energy Saver, a home energy audit business and Maid Brigade, an eco-minded home cleaning service. It’s just not clear which, if any of them, can achieve the brand recognition and mass market presence of a top franchise like SUBWAY restaurants, or Hampton Hotels.

826,Study Finds Unsafe Amounts of Lead In Reusable Bags Sold By Major Retailers,https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/24/study-unsafe-lead-in-reusable-bags/,2011/01/24," A new study published today by the nonprofit Center for Consumer Freedom (CCF) based on testing done by Frontier Global Sciences in Seattle, found that many reusable bags sold by major U.S. retailers today contain unsafe amounts of lead.
The CCF advertises itself as a force against the “nanny-state,” and advocates for “consumer freedom.” They also appear to argue that food, beverage and restaurant businesses should be able to do, sell and give away whatever the heck they please, never mind the environmental or social consequences. Frontier Global Sciences is a privately held business that provides environmental sampling and analysis services.
Their study found:

“Of the 44 organizations whose bags were tested, 16 are selling or distributing reusable bags containing lead in amounts greater than 100 ppm (parts per million), which is where many states set the limit for heavy metals in packaging…
National chains such as CVS, Safeway, Bloom, and Walgreens were among those with high levels of lead found in their reusable bags. CVS and Safeway led the pack with 697 and 672 ppm respectively; both were nearly seven times the 100 ppm limit. To date, CVS is the only store that tested above 100 ppm to have recalled their bags. Previously lululemon athletica, Sears-Canada, and Wegmans have all recalled bags due to high levels of lead.
Retailers testing positive for excessive levels of lead included Staples, Giant Eagle, Piggly Wiggly, Giant, Gerbes, KTA Superstore, Brookshire Brothers, Stater Bros., and, ironically, the District of Columbia Department of Environment.”

 In a press statement CCF senior research analyst J. Justin Wilson says “retailers were goaded into selling these bags” by environmentalists. He also suggests that banning stores from giving away, and enabling the pervasive consumption of disposable, non-biodegradable plastic bags inevitably results in stores selling cheap, unsafe reusable goods.
It’s hard to believe the bans on plastic bags — from China and Italy to multiple U.S. cities— are causing more harm than good, however.
Consider the magnitude of plastic, single-use bag waste in recent years: in Europe, an estimated 100 billion disposable plastic bags are used annually, according to the green blog Environmental Leader. Meanwhile, the San Jose Mercury News reports, in the U.S. only 13 percent of recyclable, non-biodegradable plastic bags actually get recycled each year.
Until tech and design innovators, or groups like PopTech’s Ecomaterials Innovation Lab and the Sustainable Packaging Coalition can devise a zero-impact single use bag, concerned shoppers with any environmental awareness should probably opt to bring their own, lead free reusables.
It’s even possible to make one out of old school plastic disposables, or buy one made of safe, and recycled materials from a specialty web store like ReuseIt.com or One Bag at a Time (hat tip: Ecosalon).

827,"Good Thing For Green Tech? GE Chief, Jeff Immelt, To Chair Obama's Council On Jobs",https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/23/ge-immelt-adviser-to-obama/,2011/01/23," On Friday, President Obama appointed General Electric’s chief executive, Jeff Immelt — an advocate for carbon cap-and-trade  — chairman of his panel of outside economic advisors, the newly branded Council on Jobs and Competitiveness.
This council was formerly known as PERAB (the President’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board). Immelt was a founding member, and takes the chairman reigns from Paul Volcker.
GE is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of clean energy and related technologies. The company makes everything from large wind turbines, to electric vehicle charging stations, to good old lights and appliances.
Could the rising political influence of Jeff Immelt (image, below) be a good thing for green innovators in the U.S.? Could clean tech newcomers, small businesses and competitors suffer from policy endorsed by the CEO of the established giant?

The Christian Science Monitor’s Mark Trumbull reported:

“[Immelt’s selection] opens the door to potential conflicts of interest. GE’s future profits are intertwined with government policies in the US and elsewhere. It makes equipment used in energy, infrastructure, health care, and defense. On Wednesday, when Obama sang the praises of export-related contracts that US firms have won in China recently, GE deals figured prominently. [While] economists say growing exports – for GE and other firms – are one vital way for the US to grow jobs…Even in a best-case scenario for exports, America will need lots of other jobs, as well.
Some business leaders worry that an expected move by the Environmental Protection Agency to limit carbon emissions could impose damaging costs on the economy.”


Noting GE’s plans to develop a net-zero home with solar and wind power, its competition for clean tech startups and inventors, Ecomagination, and its recent efforts to put small wind turbines in homes and businesses, CleanTechnica contributor Tina Casey saw Immelt’s role as a good thing for all that’s green and clean in the U.S. She even defended his company’s earlier habit of outsourcing jobs, copiously:
“The initial reaction to President Obama’s announcement has been mixed, mainly due to GE’s past record of outsourcing jobs.  However [since] 2009 you’ll find Immelt admitting that too much outsourcing… hurt the U.S. economy, and calling for a domestic manufacturing revival to get us out of the doldrums. That puts him squarely in line with Obama’s call for an economy ‘fueled by what we invent and what we build…'”
President Obama gushed about Immelt in a weekly address on Saturday:

“…GE’s CEO [is] one of the most imaginative and visionary business leaders in America. [He] has agreed to head up our new Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. The purpose of this council is to help us find ways to grow our economy by investing in our businesses here at home. And under Jeff’s leadership, I’m confident that they’ll generate good ideas about how we can spur hiring, educate our workers to compete in the 21st century, and attract the best jobs and businesses to America rather than seeing them spring up overseas.”

Check out the rest of the president’s remarks on Immelt, and let us know if you think he’s the right man for the job(s) and a good thing for green sector innovation.

828,"Electric Vehicle Makers, CODA Holdings, Appoint Phil Murtaugh CEO",https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/21/ev-makers-coda-name-murtaugh-ceo/,2011/01/21," Today, the Santa Monica, Calif.-based maker of electric vehicles and batteries, CODA Holdings, appointed auto industry veteran Phil Murtaugh as chief executive officer.
On a conference call, CODA’s interim CEO Steven “Mac” Heller described Murtaugh as someone who believes “the automotive industry can innovate rapidly and be more responsible as a global citizen,” and is deeply experienced in building American auto businesses in Asia. Earlier this month, the company raised a $76 million bringing its equity funding to about $200 million, sparking IPO rumors.
Murtaugh previously worked as chairman and chief executive officer of GM China. Over a decade, he grew GM’s presence there from fifteen employees in its Shanghai operations to 15,000 employees throughout the country, increasing the unit’s revenue from $300 million to more than $7 billion. In brief, Murtaugh discussed CODA’s plans in Asia, and how he will leverage his experience on behalf of the younger car company:

“We have a joint venture with one of the three largest battery manufacturers in China [Lishen Power Battery of Tianjin, China, whose principal shareholder is CNOOC, or China National Offshore Oil Company]. The joint venture is called LIO [Energy Systems]. They will manufacture the battery systems for [our] vehicles. We also have contract assembly agreements to assemble the [battery packs]…
A vast majority of CODA manufacturing will be in China. That fits nicely with experiences I’ve had [there] for the last 15 years. I understand China’s manufacturers and culture. My experience will help us deal with those situations. We’re going to introduce our vehicle into China’s domestic market as well as in the U.S.”


Through its battery system joint venture, currently CODA is a large-scale producer of power battery systems for the transportation and utility industries. Murtaugh touched upon CODA’s retail sales outlook for its vehicles in the U.S., as well.
“We haven’t announced our plans. But what I can tell you is this…We won’t start our retail sales through a traditional dealer network. It will involve setting up company-owned sales outlets. They will be in high visibility areas with lots of [foot] traffic where people will be able to walk in or make an appointment [online] to test drive vehicles. [Customers will be able to] configure their vehicles, and place orders online. This will be a no-haggle buying experience. That’s shown to be very, very successful with other [car] brands.”

With Murtaugh’s appointment, Miles L. Rubin, CODA’s founder and co-chairman becomes a chairman emeritus, remains a company director and the company’s largest shareholder. Heller, CODA Holdings interim CEO and a co-chairman, will move into the role of executive chairman.

Draper is a non-profit in Cambridge, Massachusetts that develops advanced technology, and assists and invests in others’ innovation for space, air, land and sea exploration. One of Next Giant Leap’s team members, Seamus Tuohy (also Draper’s director of space systems) explained what NGL is working on and its potential uses:


“We’re developing critical technology for landing and hopping, both to satisfy the rules for the Google Lunar X Prize, and to provide an innovative, regional-scale science measurement capability. Unlike rovers that go to a single point on the surface of a planet, and then maybe two kilometers away and back, retreating if something is in the way, these would land, then ascend a bit, do a translation, traverse above the terrain to land in another spot. The lander-hopper we’re building is about the size of a coffee table, not a car.
I believe this would be particularly valuable to the environmental cause. The future ability to monitor the environment is a government concern, but who’s to say the best technology and services to measure greenhouse gases, and other things might not come from a commercial enterprise like Next Giant Leap? These technologies we’re working on let you place sensors, gather samples from difficult-to-access locations on the moon, and on earth as well where you don’t want to send a manned vehicle or a helicopter.”


Another team member with NGL, Todd J. Mosher, a program manager at Sierra Nevada Corporation, said potential buyers of NGL’s lander technology could include NASA as an anchor, and a number private sector companies that look at the moon as the next Gold Rush site, full of untapped water and mineral resources that are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive on earth.
Mosher and Tuohy envision NASA using NGL’s landers in “operations-to-station” and “commercial crew development” programs, bringing people and their supplies to the surface of the moon and back, or in scientific investigations. NASA, however, is not in the practice of mining other planets for resources Mosher noted. Beyond government missions, he explained, his team’s lander technology and more so, competitions like the Google Lunar X Prize, could have a huge impact on clean energy, water and minerals trade:

“My kids are doing an explorers’ segment in school right now, studying Magellan, Ponce de Leon and those folks. If you study that history, the first wave of explorers were funded by the government. They went out and found places. The next waves were entrepreneurs and traders who turned scientific discoveries into something profitable. They may not be as glamorous, but what they did led to the development of trade routes that connected people, and allowed settlements that turned into great cultures.
NGL’s landers are robotic scouts or prospectors that will head out to new territories to discover forms of wealth for all of us. They depend on solar rays to get their power. So does a lot of space technology, actually. They’re part of the next wave that will make space exploration much more sustainable. They can also help us explore water deposits that are believed to be in cold traps, or craters on the surface of the moon that the sun doesn’t reach.
The competition is driving people to get together and figure things out. We may not solve this problem in our first mission, but we’re thinking about how to survive a lunar night, which is equivalent to 14 days on earth in darkness, if our vehicles and stations run on solar. If we develop something rugged and robust enough to work in that extreme environment, it will help us back here on earth.”

With this grant, the NGL team, led by founder Michael Joyce, has raised about $1.5 million, including an investment of $200,000 by the team’s founder Michael Joyce, a $100,000 from Jolted Media Group Ltd., a $30,000 grant from eSpace an incubator program for space startups, and $125,000 from Sierra Nevada Corporation.

830,Out Of The Box: Bloom Energy Debuts 'Electrons' Financing Service,https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/20/bloom-launches-financing-service/,2011/01/20," In a move that could be torn from the playbook of SolarCity, Bloom Energy introduced a financing service today called Bloom Electrons that could popularize its solid oxide fuel cells, and make clean energy more accessible to the owners and operators of commercial and institutional buildings.
Through Bloom Electrons, power-consumers commit to a 10-year contract and set rate for fuel — for now, that means natural gas provided by California-based Bloom partners including PG&E. Then, Bloom Energy installs their system (the Bloom Box, a.k.a. energy server) on the customer’s site, though the customer doesn’t pay for it up-front.
The Bloom Box was designed for use in commercial and institutional buildings or campuses that need uninterrupted, 24-7 power. It can generate power from a variety of fuels, including natural gas and biogases.
Bloom Energy collaborated with Credit Suisse and Silicon Valley Bank to arrange the new financing service. Its introduction led to the sale of 200 new Bloom systems, and deals with: the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), and medical companies Becton, Dickinson & Co., and Kaiser Permanente. The financing option also helped Bloom Energy expand its business with earlier customers: Walmart, Coca-Cola, and Staples.
A vice president of business development with Bloom, Josh Richman, told TechCrunch on Thursday that while Bloom’s products and services are only used in California today, “We’re doing analysis on other markets. The energy challenge is global. The whole world needs more and cleaner energy.”
The offer of financing options to customers resembles power purchase agreement deals in the solar industry, but was inspired in part by the spread of cell phones in the developing world, Richman said:
“Mobile phones became ubiquitous…when people could pay by the minute, not when they could buy the phone. That’s what this opportunity represents. Customers can pay for the energy they use, not the equipment, if they don’t have the capital to dedicate to it up-front.” The company does not disclose the cost of its systems and services.”


Recently, Eric Wesoff, writing for Green Tech Media, speculated that a Bloom Box of the 100-kilowatt solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) variety that’s covered by a warranty, would typically cost about $700,000, and would produce energy at about $12.50 per watt, a bit less if subsidised. That hardly sounds affordable.
Other Bloom skeptics appearing on CBS’s 60 Minutes, and writing for Forbes have suggested the business could only succeed in making clean energy accessible and pervasive, if its boxes prove durable, and the company lowers the price per unit.
Bloom Energy’s Richman would not address speculative reports including the three aforementioned. He pointed out, however, that a dollar-per-watt analysis is more effective in comparing similar technologies, CIGS to silicone solar modules for example, versus fuel cells to solar or wind products in applications within commercial buildings.
Electricity companies charge customers on a cents-per-kilowatt-hour basis. By that measure, the company claims the Bloom Box produces electricity which is cheaper than electricity prices from utilities in California.
Richman said:
“[Bloom’s energy servers] produce five to ten times the power of other systems that operate 100 percent of the day…And they take hours or days to install, instead of weeks to months. Companies who have already purchased Bloom Boxes on a capital up-front basis will recoup their costs between three and six years from the date of installation.”
Buyers of Bloom Boxes included: eBay, Adobe, Coca Cola, FedEx and Bank of America among others. The time required to install either a wind or solar power system appropriate for a commercial building or campus can range into months, according to several recent examples.
Bloom is now producing one energy server a day, versus the one-a-month rate of production just two years ago. Is this all enough to make the Bloom Box go viral?

831,"US, China Compare Clean Tech, Environmental Concerns at the Whitehouse",https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/19/presidents-on-environment-issues-industry/,2011/01/19," Today, President Barack Obama and Chinese President Hu Jintao revealed, at a press conference in Washington D.C.,  conclusions from their latest round of meetings that have taken place this week at the White House. The two world leaders have met eight times since Obama took office.
Excerpts from their speeches relating to environmental issues follow below. A full transcript of today’s press conference is available at Whitehouse.gov.
In their respective speeches, President Obama addressed the environment many times, while President Hu barely touched upon these issues directly. Instead, Hu highlighted his country’s willingness to be more collaborative and open in its handling of environmental and related trade issues.
Aside from other humanitarian, economic and geo-political security goals, the presidents said their countries’ wished and plan to: spur innovation and production of clean tech and energy; reduce pollution and curb climate change; and generally keep the flow of exports, including clean-tech related products, between the two nations robust and fair.
President Obama noted:



The U.S. is now exporting “more than $100 billion a year in goods and services to China, which supports more than half a million American jobs.”
This week, the U.S. and China “completed dozens of deals that will increase U.S. exports by more than $45 billion”
China’s investment in the U.S. increased by several billion dollars through deals announced this week that deal with: machinery, software, aviation and agriculture.
China’s new U.S. deals will support an estimated 235,000 American jobs, many in manufacturing.
As China proposed at the Nuclear Security Summit in 2010, with U.S. blessings, the country will establish a nuclear “center of excellence,” to help “secure the world’s vulnerable nuclear materials.”
The U.S. will cooperate with China on science and technology initiatives to advance agriculture and industry, including: a U.S.-China clean energy research center; joint ventures in wind power, smart grids and cleaner coal.
The U.S. wants to ensure that the “government procurement process in China is open and fair to American businesses,” especially vis a vis intellectual property protection.
Steve Ballmer of Microsoft pointed out to Obama and Hu, this week, that an estimated one customer of every 10 in China is actually paying for Microsoft products.
The U.S. and China are the two largest energy consumers and emitters of greenhouses gases, in the world.
Both Obama and Hu agree their countries have the “responsibility to combat climate change by building on the progress at Copenhagen and Cancun, and showing the way to a clean energy future.”



President Hu noted:


The U.S. and China “agree[d] to strengthen consultation and coordination on major issues that concern peace and development in the Asia-Pacific region and in the world,” including: the Korean Peninsula, the Iranian nuclear issue, climate change and others.
China and the United States will…promote denuclearization of the Korean peninsula in Northeast Asia.
Each year China and the U.S. have about 3 million people traveling between the two countries. (Each day, about 7,000 to 8,000 will be traveling between China and the United States.)
China plans to “work with the United States and other countries to effectively address global challenges, such as meeting the climate challenge, energy and resource security, food security, public health security and serious natural disasters.”

832,Scientific Conservation Raises $15.6 Million To Help Cut Energy Waste In Commercial Buildings,https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/19/scientific-conservation-seriesb-15-6/,2011/01/19," Scientific Conservation Inc. (SCI) — a San Francisco company that makes software to diagnose and help stop energy-wasting problems in commercial buildings — raised $15.6 million in a series B investment led by DFJ Growth Fund the companies announced today.  DFJ Ventures and The Westly Group also joined the round, which brings the company’s total funding raised to $24.6 million.
SCI’s software-as-a-service specifically analyzes HVAC systems, refrigeration, lighting, controls and renewable energy sources within buildings to help their owner-managers manage them, consume less power, and cut annual energy expenditures. The company’s clients include Harley Davidson, 7-Eleven, Intel and Santa Clara County.
McGraw-Hill Construction’s Green Outlook 2011 report estimated that the U.S. non-residential green buildings market in 2010 rose to $43 billion at the low-end, or as much as $54 billion.
The trend should continue over the next five years, the report said, in part driven by public policy and law. As of September 2010, 12 federal agencies, 33 states and 384 local government programs put green building legislation or policies in place, requiring institutional buildings, like schools and court houses, to be green.

833,ReneSola Claims New Wafer Will Boost Solar Cell Efficiency To 17.5 Percent,https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/18/renesola-virtus-wafer-claims/,2011/01/18," ReneSola (NYSE: SOL) a major manufacturer of solar products based in Jiashan, China announced this week that its new silicon-based wafer, dubbed the Virtus, boosts multicrystalline solar cell efficiency to 17.5 percent.
The company plans to sell the Virtus Wafer to manufacturers of multicrystalline solar cells. Its earlier customers in this segment have included: Suntech Power, JA Solar, and ARISE Technologies. JC Solar, a wholly owned subsidiary of ReneSola which makes multicrystalline solar cells and modules, will both test and use the Virtus in its products, of course.
Why is ReneSola shouting their un-verified wafer claims to the rooftops? Is this really a huge breakthrough?
Companies like SunPower in San Jose, California or SunGrid in Australia have been producing monocrystalline solar cells for years that are even more efficient than 17.5 percent. However, monocrystalline cells and panels have tended to be more expensive than polycrystalline varieties due to more complicated manufacturing requirements.
ReneSola’s Virtus Wafer could help bring the cheaper-to-make variety of solar tech — multicrystalline solar cells and panels — to be about as efficient as monocrystalline varieties, without being as costly to manufacture. (Making solar power more affordable, eventually to the point where solar is at parity or better versus coal and oil, remains a holy grail within the sector.)
ReneSolar plans to embark on pilot production of their Virtus Wafer in early 2011, according to a company press statement. Thus far, the wafer has been tested in solar cells made by some of the company’s clients, and in their own labs. However, it has not been tested by the U.S.-based National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a verifier of cell efficiency claims, nor by an NREL equivalent in another country.
The wafer still has yet to be tested in use within solar panels in any lab. Those initial tests of panels incorporating this wafer are under way, a company spokesperson confirmed.
ReneSola’s competition in the quest to build a better wafer — one that improves the efficiency of solar photovoltaics, but is not more expensive to manufacture — range from the venture-backed Boston startup, 1366 Technologies to a fellow, major solar manufacturer in China, LDK Solar.

834,"Car Battery Makers, Johnson Controls, Building A $150 Million Recycling Plant In South Carolina",https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/18/jci-battery-recycling-facility-sc/,2011/01/18," Automotive parts and batteries manufacturer, Johnson Controls Inc., broke ground on a new battery recycling plant in Florence, South Carolina, today. Local and national environmental groups there reached consensus with the company on air emissions standards in August 2010, allowing the company to embark on its plans to build a $150 million facility, taking up about 36 acres of a 270-acre property.
The permits represent the first in about twenty years given to “a new, fully integrated battery recycling facility in the United States,” multiple spokespersons from Johnson Controls have noted.
The battery recycling center news follows Johnson Controls’ introduction (at the Detroit auto show earlier this month) of a new lithium-ion battery for electric and hybrid vehicles, which was manufactured in Holland, Michigan.
Johnson controls is producing the lithium-ion batteries, domestically, with French partner Saft. Ford agreed to buy the made-in-Michigan batteries for use in their electric and hybrid vehicles.
A $299.2 million grant in 2009 through the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act incentivized Johnson Controls to build its domestic factories that namely produce nickel-cobalt-metal battery cells and packs, and battery separators (with partner Entek) for hybrid and electric vehicles.
Johnson Controls’ battery recycling business in South Carolina was not subsidised by the same, federal stimulus grants, however. Of the $2.4 billion spent on the program to “accelerate the manufacturing and deployment of the next generation of US batteries and electric vehicles,” just $9.5 million went to a recycling business, TOXCO Inc. in Anaheim, California.

835,"Smart Energy Consultancy, Gridpoint, Raises Another $23.6 Million",https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/14/gridpoint-raises-23-6-million-more/,2011/01/14," A new SEC filing revealed today that Gridpoint — a smart energy consultancy based in Arlington, Virginia — raised another $23.6 million to design, build and install energy tracking and management systems for companies or government agencies seeking to cut costs and reduce consumption.
Founded in 2003, Gridpoint appointed a new chief executive, John B. Spiritos, last quarter (October 2010). In the spring last year, the company won a $28 million contract with the United States Postal Service (USPS) to install energy management systems in selected post office locations across the U.S. It also made a number of acquisitions in the smart-grid space.
In previous interviews with Gridpoint engineers, TechCrunch learned that the company has developed a bit of a specialty in sourcing and using solar and other clean tech equipment from domestic companies. Solar panels and other technology made of raw materials from, and manufactured in the U.S., qualify for a number of federal and state subsidies, rebates or grants.
TechCrunch has reached out for further details on how and where Gridpoint plans to put its new-found capital to work, and which investors were involved in this round. Executives at Gridpoint were not available to comment, immediately. The funding appears to be an extension of an earlier series E round.

836,"Chairman Of Build Your Dreams, A Major Clean Tech Manufacturer, Wins ""China's Peace Prize""",https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/14/byd-chairman-wins-caipc/,2011/01/14," The chairman of Build Your Dreams (BYD) one of the world’s largest clean tech and electric vehicle manufacturers, Chuanfu Wang, won China’s Canton Provincial Award for Individual Contribution the company announced today.
The Canton Government awarded the CPAIC, a.k.a. “China’s Peace Prize,” to Wang for leading a business that has consistently developed and commercialized solar power, battery, LED and electrified transportation technologies. Use of BYD products in Canton, the government there claims, significantly reduced air pollution in the province.
Also known as Guangdong, the Canton region drew scrutiny over air quality issues leading up to the Asian Games which it hosted in November 2010. The local government put restrictions on cars, factories and power plants leading up to the event, and even shut them down during the games to appease air pollution related health concerns. According to Xinhua News Agency, nitrogen dioxide pollution remains a serious air quality concern in the area.

BYD’s chairman was also lauded for assisting poverty-stricken areas of China with donations of equipment and money from his company. Under his direction, BYD custom-designed for, then manufactured and gave one thousand solar energy storage-and-lighting systems to the nomadic people of Tibet. In September 2010, Wang established the BYD Charity Foundation to encourage his company’s 130,000 employees (and others) to donate to the needy.
China’s Peace Prize (CPAIC) is given out every two years to two individuals or teams. The prize carries a purse of about 30 Million RMB or $4.55M USD, and recognizes those who elevate the social and economic welfare of China, but accomplish the feat without harm to the environment.
Giving the award to a clean tech industry leader symbolized Canton’s support of the nation’s stated goals, including to reduce carbon intensity 40% from 2005 levels by the year 2020.
BYD’s financiers include Warren Buffett (Berkshire Hathaway) and MidAmerican Energy Holdings. Competing with A123 Systems, BYD is a battery supplier to Daimler AG in Asia, and is the world’s largest supplier of mobile phone batteries. Competing with everyone from Nissan to Tesla, BYD plans to sell the BYD e6, an all-electric vehicle massively throughout the U.S. in early 2012, according to a Reuters report from this week’s Detroit auto show.

837,Hybrid Streetlights: Good Or Bad News For Utilities?,https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/13/wind-solar-streetlights-sanya/,2011/01/13,"
 Urban Green Energy — a New York City startup that designs and manufactures small wind turbines — has released and installed the first of its new, “hybrid” or wind- and solar-powered streetlights.
Designed for primary use in parking lots or over highways, UGE’s Sanya streetlights include a standard setup of the company’s 600 W Eddy wind turbines, along with a steel tower or pole, solar panels, lead acid batteries of the variety used in many cars, controls and light emitting diodes (LEDs) made by suppliers from Asia and the U.S. They can store up to 5 days of power, and can be customized to cast a particular color of light according to the product’s official webpage.
The UGE Sanya could take some business away from utilities by generating power from off-the-grid renewables for use in the pervasive, on-all-night streetlights. In many U.S. markets today, electric companies are the ones who actually install, maintain and power communities’ residential streetlights. This traditional business model has caused problems recently for various municipalities and utilities that serve them.
In Fayetteville, North Carolina (as reported by Andrew Barksdale for The Fayetteville Observer, N.C.) Progress Energy (NYSE: PGN) is threatening to turn the streetlights off, unless the town pays a bill over $100,000 there, or gives PE permission to charge monthly fees to customers it serves in the area.
It’s even worse in Lawrence, Kansas (as reported by Chad Lawhorn for the Lawrence Journal World & News). The city’s auditor, Michael Eglinski, believes the power company in charge of streetlights there, Westar Energy, is overcharging Lawrence for electricity it provides, failing to meter precisely, and worse is using woefully inefficient bulbs deliberately to boost sales.
Consumers can’t turn streetlights owned by utilities on or off, nor can they swap out old bulbs for highly efficient ones. The arrangement doesn’t feel fair to every resident. Utilities’ sympathizers, on the other hand, point out that they are responsible for things like repairing street lamps should a tree branch or car accident take one out, and incur other costs to keep cities safely lit.

The UGE Sanya streetlights could provide one benefit to utilities, though. Since they’re grid connectable, the lights can send excess power from the wind turbines and solar panels back through the grid. That helps utilities fulfill regulatory requirements to increase the percent of power they get from local, renewable sources.
Nick Blitterswyk, founder and chief executive of UGE, said more than 100 Sanya streetlights sold in the product’s first month on the market. None of Sanya’s buyers so far have been utilities in the U.S. Queries have come from municipalities, retailers and hotels eager to illuminate their properties, cut electricity costs, and win a green public image.
A mechanical engineer at UGE, Mateo Chaskel, said that the constantly moving turbine technology in the lights should last twenty years, requiring just an annual maintenance check-up, barring natural disasters or accidents. Not including the batteries, the LED lights and other parts within should endure as long as the turbines, he said. He hopes they’ll reduce waste from spent bulbs, along with maintenance costs for companies, cities and utilities that switch to the Sanya.
The streetlights are assembled at a UGE facilitly in Asia, and shipped to San Francisco for distribution in North America. They usually qualify for a 30% rebate from the federal government. The city of San Francisco recently installed the hybrid lights as part of Mayor Gavin Newsom’s sustainable civic center efforts. More recently, Chaskel said, they were installed in about five sites in Pusan, South Korea. They will soon be installed in lots and along city streets in: San Jose, Oklahoma, Ohio, the Virgin Islands, Australia, and Poland.

838,"GE To Buy Lineage Power, Makers Of Green Data Center Equipment, For $520 Million",https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/13/lineage-selling-to-ge-520million/,2011/01/13," Consumer and business uptake of cloud computing, mobile internet voice, video and real-time data are increasing energy demand dramatically among data centers, telecom and IT service providers. Anticipating the trend will continue for quite some time, General Electric (GE) today announced its plan to acquire Lineage Power Holdings from Los Angeles private equity firm, Gores Group, for $520 million.
Lineage Power, formerly Tyco Electronics Power Systems, designs, manufactures and sells what it calls “high-efficiency power conversion infrastructure technology.” Its used to convert alternating to direct currents or vice versa in a wide variety of contexts. The equipment is installed in systems that run small to large power plants, data centers, networks, even airplanes (namely in navigation tools in the cockpit, or in-flight entertainment systems).
The company claims its technology in the data center can:

“Reduce energy loss and lower cooling costs by 50-70%…prioritize sustainable energy sources like solar, wind, water and fuel cells over traditional utility grid or diesel generator sources – and [allow power systems to] intelligently respond to smart grid information to reduce [a company’s energy] consumption during peak demand periods.”
Among Lineage Power’s clients are Verizon, Cisco, Ericsson, HP and Oracle.
This acquisition will cost GE more than five-times what the company is investing through its Ecomagination Challenge in earlier stage clean tech companies and concepts. GE Energy Services has been involved in about a dozen deals in the last 6 months, with its largest a bid to acquire Dresser — another privately held energy infrastructure company — for $3.1 billion. Its other acquisitions during that time have been in smart grid companies in the U.K., Australia and Canada, and in joint ventures and other deals with energy businesses in China and Turkey.

841,Viridity Energy Raises $14 Million To Turn Power Consumers Into Producers,https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/11/viridity-energy-seriesb-14-million/,2011/01/11," A Pennsylvania startup Viridity Energy drew a series B investment of $14 million from Braemar Energy Ventures and Intel Capital, the company reported today.
Founded in 2008, Viridity Energy offers “distributed demand management software, systems and services,” that can turn very energy-consuming businesses into producers and sellers of power back to the grid. Viridity’s technology can also help companies get paid to control and reduce their energy consumption.
The company’s customers to-date have been retailers, hospitals, universities and various military and government agencies. In Philadelphia, Viridity set up systems for the transit authority (SEPTA) that capture energy released by braking, electric subway trains, and store it in rail-side battery arrays, routing the power back through the third rail to reuse it for trains’ acceleration.
Yep, electricity can be recycled.
SEPTA reported that the project cut expenditures directly. It also allowed SEPTA to get credits and incentives from the regional power authority for decreasing energy use during peak hours, and in general. The company plans to bring similar systems to other cities and transit systems in the U.S. this year.

Viridity Energy’s chief executive and president Audrey Zibelman said on Tuesday:

“We’re moving from an [energy] industry dominated by large-scale generation where customers are passive to one where customers are active in what they consume, and what they produce. First, there were personal computers. Now we’re going to personal energy.”
Her company plans to work as a “technology agnostic, market enabler,” she said. Its focus near term is to develop more, “micro-grids” in the northeastern U.S., California and Texas — all regions with aggressive goals to switch from hydrocarbon to renewable energy sources, or to curb greenhouse gas emissions.
Its new-found capital will go towards hiring technical and sales talent to get new projects going, Zibelman said. Her company will also continue to build partnerships with other smart-grid and distributed energy players, such as the manufacturers of control systems, or banks and energy programs that finance solar, storage and power generation assets.

Today the company revealed a new — perhaps not surprising — “eco-home” focus for phase two of their Ecomagination Challenge, a competition through which GE and its venture capital partners committed to invest $200 million in clean, green technology startups.
The Ecomagination Challenge is now seeking green tech ideas to power the home. More specifically, the competition wants proposals in the following consumer-facing categories: household energy efficiency including management software, appliances and air conditioning; and renewable power, from solar, wind, hydro and biomass.

Applications will be accepted online through GE’s Ecomagination Challenge site from January 18 to March 1, 2011, then discussed and voted on by the user community there, with winners selected and announced in the early spring.
TechCrunch covered the phase one winners of the Ecomagination challenge in November, and the beginning of this initiative in July.
In an interview this week about the competition thus far, GE’s chief marketing offier and senior vice president, Beth Comstock said:


“The focus of the Powering Your Home phase of the challenge is innovation that consumers can touch and feel.
Phase one was great. We funded ideas from such a wide spectrum, especially to create and use [resources and energy sustainably]. But we felt we could get consumers more engaged at this point.
We got about 1,000 ideas in the home energy management space alone, out of about 4,000 total ideas in the last phase. They came from kids as young as ten and entrepreneurs over ninety. They came in from about 150 countries.
We evaluated those and are still evaluating some that may not have been appropriate for investments at the time, but may have something we want to license, for example. Many of the ideas we saw also could have become stronger and qualify for investment moving forward. We’ll encourage some of those applicants to submit new or stronger ideas to ecomagination.
Since we only announced our investments in November, it is too early to see returns. We continue to have very fruitful discussions with retailers about working together in licensing and distribution.
Though the challenge invested $55 million in the last phase, we haven’t set an amount we plan to invest in Powering Your Home. We’ll just have to see the ideas.”

General Electric’s chief executive officer Jeff Immelt is also set to speak about some of the company’s digital energy and other green initiatives on the Innovation Power Panel at CES 2011 today.

844,Will CODA Pull A Tesla? Electric Vehicle Makers Raise Another $76 Million,https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/06/coda-ev-series-d-76-million/,2011/01/06," CODA Holdings (or CODA Automotive) the Santa Monica, Calif. company that plans to sell all-electric sedans in the U.S. this year, raised another $76 million according to a company statement today. The company’s total equity funding, with this round, reached about $200 million. CODA’s new backers include Harbinger Capital Partners and Riverstone Holdings, who were joined by earlier investors AERIS Capital and the Angeleno Group.
In addition to producing electric vehicles, CODA manufactures power storage systems for transportation and utility businesses, through a joint venture with Chinese Lishen Power Battery, LIO Energy Systems. It is hoping to open a battery and power storage systems manufacturing facility in Ohio. According to a company press statement, “construction of [the] facility is contingent upon the approval and receipt of a Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) loan.”
In recent years, newcomers to the auto industry have focused on electric vehicles, from the sporty and luxurious (Tesla, Fisker) to the utilitarian (Smith, Smart USA). Targeting the market for environmentally sensible sedans, CODA faces significant competition from incumbents and peers alike. Toyota, Honda, Lexus, Mercedes, Ford and BMW offer hybrid sedans already. The all-electric sedan from Nissan (the Leaf) is now entering the market at a price lower than CODA has promised, and Tesla has announced plans to sell its Model S in 2012, too.

This fall, CODA won support from a major car rental business, Enterprise, which committed to purchase 100 of its all-electric vehicles in 2011, and to provide “courtesy transportation” loaners for early CODA customers when their EVs are in the shop for maintenance and service.
Coda’s executives have stated a goal to go public. Analysts and clean tech investors are divided on whether another EV company’s prospects look good for 2011, however. It’s crowded out there.
Palo Alto-based EV sports car and sedan makers, Tesla, successfully IPO’d in June 2010, drawing a large investment and eventually becoming partners with Toyota. In November 2010, General Motors pulled off the largest IPO in U.S. history raising $20.1 billion, recovering after a government bailout for the company. Last month at an auto show in China, GM revealed plans for its Chevrolet Sail Electric Vehicle.

845,U.S.D.A. Giving INEOS Bio $75 Million Loan To Make Ethanol From Waste,https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/05/ineos-biofuel-75-million-loan-guarantee-usda/,2011/01/05," INEOS New Planet BioEnergy — a joint venture between the biofuels division of the chemicals company INEOS, and waste management and biofuel facility consultants New Planet Energy — secured a $75 million loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Biorefinery Assistance Program, the government agency confirmed today.
The company plans to use the money to construct and begin running a facility near Vero Beach, Florida that primarily turns waste into ethanol. According to a company statement, the BioEnergy Center should begin commercial biofuel production in 2012, providing 175 temporary construction jobs, and 50 additional full-time jobs once the facility is completed.
Based in Indian River County, Florida the facility attained permits last year, and is already being built. It is designed to produce 8 million gallons (24,000 tonnes) of third-generation ethanol for sale. It will also produce an estimated six megawatts (gross) of renewable energy through gasification and heat capture that INEOS Bio will use to run the facility.

The core technology in this BioEnergy Center involves a patented anaerobic fermentation step through which bacteria convert gases from biomass directly into ethanol. This allows the company to produce ethanol from multiple, rather than single, separated feedstocks.
INEOS Bio will derive and produce biofuel from: construction, forestry, agricultural and municipal solid waste, rather than food crops like sugar or corn. The company hopes to license its technology and help create additional waste-to-fuel plants around the world, especially in rural communities.

846,"SoloPower Raises Another $51.6 Million To Make Flexible, Thin Film Solar Panels",https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/05/solopower-raises-51-1-million-more/,2011/01/05," An SEC filing today revealed that SoloPower of San Jose, Calif. raised another $51.6 million venture investment to design, manufacture and distribute their thin-film solar technology.
The company makes flexible solar panels of the copper-indium-gallium-selenide (CIGS) variety. This technology is lighter weight, and flexible compared to polycrystalline silicon cell solar equipment. As an engineer from GridPoint recently told TechCrunch, flexible thin-film solar panels can be installed in where more rigid, heavier options won’t work.
According to SoloPower’s website:
[The company] uses a proprietary electroplating-based process to manufacture its CIGS cells on flexible metal foil. The devices are then processed in a moduling line and laminated in an encapsulation system that provides a moisture barrier and environmental integrity. The company expects…to address the commercial and industrial rooftop and distributed solar power generation markets.


This fall, SoloPower attained safety certifications from Underwriter Laboratories (UL) — an organization that tests and certifies product safety internationally — and others that enabled it to sell in new markets. Its current customers (as of Dec. 2010) are based in: Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Japan, and Korea, and multiple locations in North America.
Last February, SoloPower raised about $45 million in debt financing. It is also seeking a possible $190 million loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy to grow its manufacturing business, and the Portland Business Journal reports today, a $20 million state energy loan in Oregon to build a plant in Portland.
SoloPower’s new venture round came from its prior backers:  Crosslink Capital, Convexa and Hudson Clean Energy Partners, according to the filing.

847,GoodGuide Rolls Out New Social Features,https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/04/goodguide-new-social-features/,2011/01/04," GoodGuide — the mobile app and website that helps people find products that measure up to their environmental and social values — quietly rolled out new, social networking and product recommendation features this month.
Groups of friends and colleagues can now follow each other via GoodGuide, share product reviews, and either warn to avoid, or encourage one another to try certain brands or items, there. The “social networking overlay” (as the company’s executives call it) adds the following features to the app and site:

Realtime feed of what products people are scanning or looking up on their iPhones, now.
Community voting, with an aggregate view of which products the GoodGuide community recommends or avoids.
Social context that lets users see which products their Facebook friends recommend or avoid.
Influence scores for GoodGuide users, taking into account their number of contributions and how many connections they have with others.
A leaderboard of the GoodGuide members with the highest influence scores.
Trending topics, covering ingredients, issues, and brands that are of interest to consumers based on site traffic and Good Guide’s science team.



The founder and chief sustainability officer of GoodGuide Dara O’Rourke explained most of the app’s users worry about health, environmental and social impacts, but everyone prioritizes differently.
Some worry more about fair labor and trade practices, like whether a company compensates their workers fairly all along their supply chain, while others worry more about how biodegradable a product or its packaging might be. In 2010, O’Rourke said, GoodGuide’s users increasingly turned to the app to avoid specific known toxic or disagreeable ingredients.
The company’s employees have formed their own group with the new social features, and begun sharing and discussing corporate social responsibility issues, and products’ impact and effectiveness (image above).
An earlier version of the app already allowed users to scan bar codes on items they own, and store lists of items corresponding to a room in the house (image below). They rack up automatic “scores” reflecting how their bathroom, or laundry room supplies rank given their stated values. With Good Guide’s new social features, users can compare bathroom to bathroom, pantry to pantry, etc.

O’Rourke believes social features can give a huge word-of-mouth boost to brands that are most appreciated by customers and are most honest (or transparent) about what they make and how. He also believes it can inspire people to be competitive, in a good-natured way, about living a healthy and sustainable lifestyle.
Social recommendations make brands more memorable than editorial mentions or ads, generally, recent research suggests. This fall, Nielsen Online published research that found 68 per cent of people were more likely to remember an advertisement, brand or company name if they saw one of their friends recommending it or associating themselves with it online.
GoodGuide reports its unique visitor count and engagement numbers increased  by about 20% each from November to December 2010, thanks to the addition of the social features. Comparing December 2009 to December 2010, Good Guide saw 12% growth in unique visitors.

848,"Solar Power Technologies Raises $6.08 Million To Optimize Commercial Solar Arrays, Wirelessly",https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/03/spowertech-series-a-6-million/,2011/01/03," Today, an SEC filing revealed that Solar Power Technologies raised $6.08 million for technology that helps wirelessly measure, manage and optimize the performance of large, solar power generating systems. Investors included Austin Ventures and Oxantium Ventures, the filing said.
The company claims its technology enables commercial solar arrays to harvest 15 to 20 per cent more total power over a 20 year lifespan than they would otherwise.
The system works, Burgess explained, by alleviating something called the “christmas tree light problem,” where panels in a solar array only harvest and output as much power as the weakest one in the chain.
SPT’s Clarity system includes the installation of small controllers behind panels within the array. The controllers identify a weakened panel or any other constraint or restriction in the system, then boost up the outputs of capable panels around it.
As Todd Woody noted today in a piece for Sustainable Industries: one large solar power plant can cost more than $2 billion to build in the U.S. making productivity-spiking technology (like SPT promises) sound at the very least attractive for companies that laid out so much cash to go solar, and want to get every last watt of renewable power that they can for their money.
The company’s chief executive, Ray Burgess, reported Monday that SPT will advance to a commercial launch by mid-year. The startup is currently working on field trials of its Clarity-brand monitoring and optimizing system with potential customers, namely utilities based in the southwestern United States.
Burgess said:


“We have the ability to give [customers] insight into how [their] large-scale solar arrays perform, and help them harvest and put out more power under all conditions.
There are some estimated 200 million solar photovoltaic panels installed around the world right now. Probably 20-30% of the power they could be generating now is lost before it ever gets to the grid. Maintenance of all that equipment is a challenge.
These are huge financial matters if nothing else for utilities and for commercial renewable energy.”

SPT plans to use its new-found capital to: complete its field tests; attain various safety and environmental certifications; ramp up its production; hire personnel to expand its sales footprint to Europe and Asia by the end of 2011; and to develop technology that works beyond crystalline solar panel arrays with CIGS, thin-film and concentrated photovoltaics.
Utilities may use each of these technologies in the field, SPT anticipates, depending on everything from costs to improvements in efficiency conversion rates.

849,Ciris Energy Raises $23.9 Million To Convert Coal To Natural Gas,https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/03/ciris-energy-series-b-khosla/,2011/01/03," Ciris Energy, Inc., a Cenetennial, Colorado energy startup, raised a series B investment of $23.9 million a recent SEC-filing revealed. Khosla Ventures led the round with earlier Ciris backers Braemar Energy Ventures, Rho Ventures and GE Energy Financial Services, the companies announced Monday.
Ciris Energy aims to produce natural gas from coal in a way that is more environmentally responsible and economically efficient than other methods of producing natural gas. It also aims to turn coal into a far less dangerous and polluting energy resource than it is today.
According to a feature story by James Fallows in The Atlantic:


“Mining coal is notoriously dangerous, the remnants of mines disfigure the Earth, and the by-products of coal’s combustion fill the air not simply with soot, smoke, and carbon dioxide but also with toxic heavy metals like mercury and lead, plus corrosive oxides of nitrogen and sulfur, among other pollutants…
Overall, coal-burning power plants provide nearly half (about 46 percent this year) of the electricity consumed in the United States. For the record: natural gas supplies another 23 percent, nuclear power about 20 percent, hydroelectric power about 7 percent, and everything else the remaining 4 or 5 percent.”

With its new-found capital, Ciris specificially plans to build its first commercial-scale projects for “in-situ biochemical conversion of coal to methane,” and to bring its “ex-situ biochemical coal conversion technology to commercial-ready status,” the company said in a press statement.

850,Energy Literacy Platform: Track And Turn Off Household Appliances With Your Phone,https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/29/energy-literacy-platform-track-and-turn-off-household-appliances-with-your-phone/,2010/12/29,"Using the web to track power consumption at home is something several companies are working on at the moment (including Google). Tokyo-based startup Sassor is developing a solution that offers two big selling points: their so-called Energy Literacy Platform (ELP) [English link] lets you track each household appliance individually and makes it possible to turn these devices off remotely, for example by pushing a button on your smartphone.
The Energy Literacy Platform is based on the idea that by empowering consumers with a tool that informs them how much energy their appliances really use, they will start saving energy. The platform consists of three parts:

ELP modules you place between your various power outlets and home appliances.
 The ELP receiver that harvests power consumption data to the server.
 A website or smartphone app that lets you track how much energy each appliance uses and even allows you to turn devices off remotely if needed.


The modules change their color over time, from green to yellow and finally to red, as you approach the energy limit you previously set on the ELP website or app (see below).

On the web, your energy consumption is visualized in more detail, helping you to track the exact amount of energy (and money) consumed by each device in real-time. What’s cool is that you can turn off things while on-the-go through the ELP website or the smartphone app, for example if you forgot to turn off the lights in your house.
The Energy Literacy Platform Project has come out of Japanese seed acceleration program Open Network Lab (which we covered extensively here).  Maker Sassor, run by a group of students from Keio University’s Graduate School of Media Design in Tokyo, expects to launch the platform in summer next year.

851,"EnergySavvy Raises $1.1 Million To Match Up Green Contractors, Rebates And Homeowners",https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/27/energysavvy-series-a-1-1/,2010/12/27," Seattle startup, EnergySavvy, closed a $1.1 million series-a investment according to the company’s founder and chief executive Aaron Goldfeder. EnergySavvy’s site and service motivates homeowners to reduce their power consumption through retrofit-variety improvements.
NorthWest Energy Angels led the round, joined by several investors in the Pacific Northwest, including Geoff Entress, Andy Liu, and aQuantive alumni Mike Galgon and Karl Siebrecht (the latter two are on EnergySavvy’s board).
The company’s consumer-facing website EnergySavvy.com asks users about their homes, and generates suggestions as to which type of improvements will help them save the most energy. It also guides them to rebates and other incentives for green homes, which are typically provided through government programs and power companies. Finally, the site links potential customers with qualified contractors in the area who would be able to implement recommended home improvements.
Contractors certified as residential energy efficiency experts pay to be listed, and pay for lead generation through the site. Goldfeder would not comment on the average number of customer leads a contractor can expect for his or her money, but said listings would cost $50 for initiation, then between $10 and $60 per referral, depending on the nature of the project.
EnergySavvy is web-only thus far. The company has developed proprietary databases and detailed maps of programs, contractors and utility rates, which it crosses with location data from end users’ IP addresses or routers to generate focused, local results without the aid of GPS technology.
EnergySavvy recently struck a marketing agreement with The Building Performance Institute, which bills itself as “a national standards development and credentialing organization for residential energy efficiency retrofit work.” That group’s silver- and gold-level certified contractors can initiate a complimentary listing on EnergySavvy.com.
Government and utility programs can also buy and adapt EnergySavvy’s audit tool for their own websites, using it to encourage residents and customers to take advantage of their programs (see: screenshot below). Competition for EnergySavvy could come from a range of other environmental and home improvement sites.

EcoRebates.com and FreeCleanSolar.com both offer audit tools, and serve contractors or retailers who want to sell more “green” products and services. Angie’s List offers listings and reviews of “eco friendly” contractors. The non-commercial site DSIREUSA lists state, local, utility and federal incentives and policies to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency.
In March, President Obama endorsed the Home Star Energy Retrofit Act, “a program of incentives for homeowners who make energy efficiency investments in their homes,” referred to casually as Homestar, or “cash for caulkers.”
The House passed a version of the bill, which is currently scheduled for Senate review and is part of the Clean Energy Jobs And Oil Accountability Act of 2010. While it is not likely to pass, Goldfeder believes, the two-year program to create energy efficient homes could prove a boon to his company and its ilk.
Jeff Genzer of the National Association of State Energy Officials explained in an NPR report earlier this year: the $6 billion of incentives for things like caulking and insulation would create 160,000 new jobs in the building sector, while helping reduce residential energy consumption in the U.S. which represents 40 percent of the nation’s overall energy consumption.
Goldfeder said his company plans to use its new found capital to hire up to 10 more employees in 2011, to enter new markets — with or without a lift from Homestar — and to create calendaring tools that make it easier for contractors and homeowners to connect. EnergySavvy, he noted, is “a stone’s throw from profitability.”

852,Smith Electric Vehicles U.S. Acquiring Its U.K.-based Parent Company For $15 Million,https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/23/smith-electric-vehicles-acquisition/,2010/12/23," Smith Electric Vehicles U.S. (SEV) and the Tanfield Group announced today that the American maker of all-electric trucks will purchase its United Kingdom-based parent company, Smith Electric Vehicles U.K. for $15 million in January.
The company began its U.S. operations in Kansas City, Mo. in 2009. Led by chief executive Bryan Hansel, SEV is buying all of the assets and operating business of Smith Electric Vehicles U.K. and renaming its business there Smith Electric Vehicles Europe to reflect an imminent expansion.
The company is eyeing Germany and France, countries whose governments have embraced renewable energy and electric vehicles, Hansel told TechCrunch on Thursday. He also explained that unifying SEV’s divisions could help the company create, operational efficiencies and market synergies that will make it more financially sound and productive:

“First, we’ll have global purchasing power for a combined volume of key components like batteries. We had technical alliances before, but negotiated separately on these things. With this deal, we can leverage global buying power. That means something today, and will help reduce and drive out costs.
Efficiencies at scale will apply for our customers, too. We can offer them contract negotiations, pricing, terms and conditions, and global warranties [that are uniform across different regional divisions] thanks to the new structure.” 

The $15-million sale will be effective Jan. 1, 2011. Smith U.K.’s current owner, the Tanfield Group, will retain 49 percent equity in SEV. This percentage is subject to dilution as SEV raises additional equity capital. Geoff Allison, the current managing director at Smith U.K. will retain his leadership role there. The company plans to retain the (approximate) 180-person workforce in Europe, and to expand it in 2011, Hansel confirmed.
 Recently, SEV announced that the United States Marine Corps signed as a customer, adding a couple of Smith Newton all-electric, commercial trucks to its fleet at a West Coast training facility, Camp Pendleton, Calif to start. The Newton is the only medium duty (class 4-7) all-electric commercial truck on the federal government’s general services administration (GSA) schedule the company confirmed.
A Marine Corps website said:

“The consumption of energy to operate our facilities in support of our mission is a large and recurring cost in terms of both taxpayer dollars and drain on non-renewable resources. Dependence on fossil fuels in a volatile market and from unstable regions of the world is both a financial and security vulnerability. In recognition of these facts, the Commandant of the Marine Corps has set a goal for a 30% reduction in energy consumption by 2015.”
The trucks are currently being built at SEV’s Kansas City, Mo. plant and are scheduled for delivery to Camp Pendleton in February 2011. SEV plans to build additional manufacturing, sales and service facilities around the world in 2011.
The company’s U.S. customers now include fleets run by: Frito-Lay, Staples, Coke, AT&T and PG&E. All have replaced some of their diesel trucks with Smith Newtons, and use them on urban delivery routes. In Europe, Smith Electric’s customers include: the grocery business Sainsbury’s,  and the shipping company TNT and several government customers through the U.K. Low Carbon Vehicle Procurement Programme.

853,New Streetline App Gives L.A. Drivers Real Time Data On Available Parking,https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/22/streetline-green-app-launch/,2010/12/22," Parker for iPhone, a new app by Streeline Inc. developed in partnership with the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) and Alan Cooper Design, gives drivers real-time data about available parking spaces in L.A.
Streetline’s goal is to help communities cut traffic congestion, wasted energy, drive time, and noise and air pollution from cars.
The startup, backed by Sutter Hill Ventures, works with builder-contractors to install its proprietary sensors in the ground, and additional repeaters and gateways up in light poles and trees, to make a mesh network. Once an area’s streets are rendered “smart,” they can record and report when cars arrive, occupy or depart spaces (and more).
The sensors, manufactured in Mountain View, Calif., have been installed in about 3,000 spaces through Los Angeles city blocks in Hollywood, Studio City and parts of Chinatown so far reports the chief executive of Streetline, Zia Yusuf.
The Parker for iPhone app could prove formidable competition for earlier-to-market concepts like: Open Spot, a Google Labs brainchild that uses crowdsourcing to gather data about available parking; or Mobile Parking Apps available in Chicago, San Francisco, San Diego, Seattle, LA, and New York.  Among other things, Mobile Parking Apps shows drivers rate comparisons between parking garages and metered spaces, and offers them deals or discounts when applicable.
 The app itself features: a map of city blocks with color-coded dots to help users quickly see where there are more than four spots, more than two spots, or fewer than two spots available. It also delivers information about parking space time limits, pricing, and whether meters take credit cards or coins.
Yusuf said the company plans to roll out an Android app within the first quarter of 2011. Down the line, he expects the Parker app to deliver more information and features to users such as: the availability of spaces in nearby garages that could be an alternative to street parking; data about spaces equipped with electric vehicle charging stations; or a feature that lets users pay meters or fines by mobile phone.
The CEO quipped ahead of Parker’s release, “You know when people say, ‘Man! I drove around for 15 minutes just looking for parking?’ Enjoy it now. Because that is quickly becoming an archaic or obsolete discussion.”
Los Angeles is not the only city interested in this technology (though it may be the one with the worst smog). Roosevelt Island, New York, Sausalito, Culver City, and Washington D.C. have signed on to use Streetline sensors to better understand transportation in their cities.
Recently, the company announced a partnership with Siemens to develop digital street signs that can direct drives sans smart phones to available parking, efficiently. Until now, Streetline focused on providing data capability to cities, airports and universities. Parker for iPhone is its first foray into consumer markets.
The app will initially cost $1.99.

Luxembourg-based Naxos Capital Partners led the $100 million investment, joined by Total Energy Ventures (an investment arm of the French oil and gas company Total) along with TPG Biotech and TPG Growth of San Francisco.
Elevance sells its specialty chemicals to the makers of bath and beauty products, detergents and lubricants. The company has gained traction in the market for “green surfactants” since its founding year (2007) by forging alliances with goliaths like: Dow Corning, Stepan, and Wilmar International.

The concept of using plant-based materials to produce chemicals and liquid fuels is not new. However, as reported by GreenCarCongress.org:


“The technology underlying [the company’s] processes is [olefin metathesis]…a catalyst technology which swaps molecular fragments on either side of a carbon-carbon double bond, has become an efficient and widely-used chemical process in petroleum refining and other industries. It enables new chemical compounds and manufacturing processes once thought to be impossible.”

Elevance won a $2.5 million grant in 2009 from the United States Department of Energy to build a demo-scale refinery. The company’s chief executive, K’Lynne Johnson, in a press statement said that the series C funding would go towards the company’s international expansion, and the creation of commercial-scale, Elevance biorefineries in Asia, North and South America.

The round was led by BlackRock and joined by all of LS9’s previous investors: Flagship Ventures, Khosla Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners and CTTV Investments LLC, the venture capital arm of Chevron Technology Ventures LLC, according to a company spokesperson.
LS9 uses synthetic biology, or what it calls “designer microbes,” and a “single-step fermentation process,” to make proprietary biofuels. The company’s pilot plant in South San Francisco has been in operation for over two years. It acquired a larger-scale production facility in Okeechobee, Florida in early 2010. This spring, LS9 won the Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) highest environmental honor.
In total, the company has raised $75 million in venture funding since 2006. LS9 plans to use the $30 million to move into commercial-scale production, and to support additional development and growth programs. TechCrunch has reached out to the company and its investors for further details.

856,"Ten Water Tech Startups To Watch, All 2010 Imagine H2O Competition Finalists",https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/16/10-water-cos-to-watch-ih20/,2010/12/16," A competition for water-related clean tech startups, Imagine H2O, announced its 2010 finalists today. The competition focuses on water startups that save energy, especially in the areas of sourcing, distributing, treating and disposing of water.
Sure, oil and water don’t mix. Neither do electricity and water. There’s still a serious connection between energy and H2O. We use huge amounts of power to get our water, and vice versa.
According to the American Council For An Energy Efficient Economy:
“Water and wastewater treatment and distribution in the United States is estimated to consume 50,000 GWh annually, representing 1.4 percent of the total national electricity consumption, and cost over $4 billion each year.”

Further research by the River Network found:
“On average, two gallons of water is consumed for every kilowatt of electricity used in the United States. This means that 170 gallons are used to run the clothes dryer, 55 gallons are used to run the computer and 73 gallons of water are used to run a TV in a typical American household every month.”

At utilities and in the home, where consumers use a significant amount of energy to heat their water, reducing water consumption almost always leads to lower costs, reduced energy consumption and less air pollution.
Imagine H2O seeks to halt a widely anticipated global water crisis, but also views global water problems today as an estimated $500 billion market opportunity for providers of water products and services.
In 2009, Fruition Sciences took the Imagine H2O grand prize for a system that monitors vineyards with wireless sensors, weather stations and software, ensuring that vines are irrigated efficiently, leading to optimal berry (or grape) yields.
The Fruition Sciences website explains:
“[The company’s] real-time sensors [are placed on vines, and] send a wireless reading of a vine’s transpiration rate, providing a precise measurement of how much water is moving through the vine…This gives an indication of the vine’s water needs. A slow rate of transpiration indicates a vine is low on water (stressed) and potentially at risk of berry dehydration.”


This year’s IH2O grand prize winners will receive at least $20,000 in cash, $15,000 of in-kind legal services and the same amount in consulting services. IH2O’s second and third place winners will each receive at least $10,000 in cash, $7,500 of in-kind legal and the same amount in accounting services.

857,"Abound Solar, Maker Of Thin Film Modules For Utilities, Raises $110 Million And Secures Huge Loan",https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/15/abound-solar-raises-110-million/,2010/12/15," Colorado-based Abound Solar— the makers of cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin-film solar modules designed for use in large solar power installations, versus residential or small commercial systems— raised a $110 million equity round, and secured a $400 million loan guarantee from the United States Department of Energy the company announced today.
Federal and equity financing of this magnitude signals domestic support of a technology that, in the solar manufacturing industry, is viewed as having a lower cost structure than others, and therefore a potential advantage in the market. Lux Research analysts predict that pricing for CdTe thin-film solar panels will fall from $1.81 per watt in 2009 to $0.98 per watt by 2015, with cost of goods falling from $0.80 per watt in 2009 to $0.54 per watt by 2015.
Abound Solar’s existing investors Invus Group, Bohemian Companies, DCM and Technology Partners participated in the new, $110 million equity round, joined by new investors BP Alternative Energy Ventures and West Hill Companies. The company has raised approximately $260 million in equity since starting up in 2007.
One of Abound Solar’s objectives is to produce solar modules that reduce the cost of generating solar electricity within large-scale, grid-connected utility and commercial applications.
According to a company statement:
“The debt and equity financings will enable Abound Solar to expand manufacturing capacity at both its existing facility in Colorado and later at a second site in Indiana, which when completed will create 1,200 new manufacturing jobs…When both plants are complete, Abound Solar will be able to produce more than 840 megawatts of solar modules annually.  The company has already begun construction of a second manufacturing line at its Longmont, Colorado facility to increase production rates in 2011.”

A report from GTM Research (The U.S. Utility PV Market: Demand…and Project Economics Through 2015) predicts that: U.S. utilities will increase their investments in solar power generation each year through 2015 to meet states’ demands for solar energy; and installations of solar projects for utility customers could reach about 3,000 megawatts annually, worth some $8 billion over the same period.
Abound Solar (formerly AVA Solar) faces multiple contenders for a piece of this market, including U.S. companies like NASDAQ-traded First Solar (FSLR) which also makes CdTe thin-film solar panels, and SunPower Corp. (SPWRB) which makes crystalline solar panels that are appropriate for use in utility-scale projects and are typically more “power dense,” or efficient than thin-film.
International solar manufacturers like Solar Frontier in Japan, Schott Solar and Sunfilm in Germany, or  ENN Solar in China, are also vying to sell their technology to the same type of large-scale customers.

858,Car-Sharing Service Zipcar Adds $21 Million To Its Coffers,https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/15/car-sharing-service-zipcar-adds-21-million-to-its-coffers/,2010/12/15,"
Car-sharing service company Zipcar this morning announced that it has raised $21 million in Series G funding. Meritech Capital Partners led the round with a $20 million investment, while Pinnacle Ventures contributed the additional $1 million.
Zipcar didn’t detail what it plans to do with the fresh capital, other than to say it intends to use the proceeds to fund working capital needs and finance fleet growth, and to continue its geographic expansion.
In a separate release, Zipcar has revealed that Steve Case, co-founder and former CEO and chairman of AOL, and John Mahoney, vice chairman and CFO of Staples, have joined its board of directors. Miraval CEO Philippe Bourguignon has stepped down from the company’s board to make room for Case.
Zipcar boasts more than 500,000 members and 8,000 vehicles in urban areas and college campuses throughout the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom (they acquired U.K. car sharing company Streetcar for $50 million earlier this year).
We reported last June that Zipcar was pondering a $75 million IPO to pay off its debts.
Guess they opted to take a different route.

859,Soladigm Raises $30 Million More To Make Smart Glass For Green Buildings,https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/14/soladigm-series-c-30-million/,2010/12/14," Soladigm raised a $30 million series C investment the company announced this morning. Founded in 2007, the company makes smart glass for green buildings that can change from clear to tinted automatically, in response to changes in light or temperature. Windows using this “electro-chromic” technology help building owners and operators reduce their heat, cooling and lighting costs, and energy consumption.
The market for green buildings is growing rapidly. According to research by McGraw Hill Construction:
Today, a third of all new nonresidential construction is green— a $54 billion market opportunity. In five years, nonresidential green building activity is expected to triple, representing $120 billion to $145 billion in new construction (40 to 48 percent of the nonresidential market) and $14 billion to $18 billion in major retrofit and renovation projects.

DBL Investors and Nano Dimension led the series C round in Soladigm, joined by General Electric (GE) Energy Financial Services, as well as earlier investors Khosla Ventures and Sigma Partners. Cynthia Ringo, Managing Partner at DBL Investors, joined Soladigm’s Board of Directors with the investment.
Last month, GE named Soladigm one of the first 12 winners of its Ecomagination Challenge, a $200 million innovation competition inviting entrepreneurs and students to share their best ideas on how to build the next-generation power grid.
In August 2010, the company announced plans to locate its primary manufacturing operations in Olive Branch, Mississippi, where it expects to create several hundred clean tech jobs. To facilitate the expensive factory build, the State of Mississippi provided the company a $40 million loan.
The series C round will help Soladigm build and launch its high-volume commercial operations and develop sales and marketing channels, according to a company statement.
Earlier this month, another maker of smart glass, Sage Electrochromics, drew an $80 million investment from Saint-Gobain, a construction materials manufacturer.

860,"Elon Musk, SolarCity Donate Power System To Gulf Coast Disaster Relief Group",https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/13/solarcity-musk-gulf-coast/,2010/12/13," Serial tech entrepreneur and investor, Elon Musk, and SolarCity— providers of solar power system and energy efficiency design, financing, installation and related services— donated a solar power generating system to the Hurricane Katrina- and BP Oil Spill-effected community of Coden, Alabama the company announced today.
The system consists of solar panel arrays attached to a battery back-up system that will allow the South Bay Communities Alliance (SBCA) Hurricane Response Center to produce its own power, reduce its cost of operations and maintain power in the event of an outage. The system, newly up and running, will produce an estimated 33,500 kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, which should offset close to 100 percent of the center’s electricity use.
The SBCA center was formed by Bayou communities in 2006 after Hurricane Katrina left families there without power, food, clothing, water and protection from the heat.
Paul Nelson, the SBCA’s executive director reported that President Obama’s administration recommended his grass-roots group as a worthy recipient of the project to Elon Musk who (through the Musk Foundation) provided the funds, and SolarCity.
The Coden area is rebuilding from two disasters, today. More than 300 families were still suffering from  storm-related home damage and losses when the BP oil spill occurred earlier this year, destroying the area’s natural resources and jobs.
A representative speaking on behalf of SolarCity and company chairman Elon Musk, who is also the chief executive of Tesla Motors and SpaceX, said this project— and others they hope to pursue in 2011— would help people reduce their “dependence on the finite power sources that pollute our air and water and complicate our geopolitics.”

861,"Electric Composters Don't Say ""Holiday,"" Where To Buy Green Tech Gifts Online",https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/11/green-gadget-shopping-guide/,2010/12/11," Reasonable people understand this by now: environmentalists aren’t all tree hugging vegetarians with unwashed hair — not that there’s anything wrong with that — and tech enthusiasts aren’t all oblivious to the burgeoning problems of energy consumption and e-waste. Still, it’s tough to shop online for geeks who want to be environmentally responsible, and nouveau hippies who covet gadgets.
Why? It’s easy to find green gifts in the beauty, fashion, home or kids category. Many retail websites,  however, bury their great green electronics pages rather than highlighting them, and making them easy to find from the homepage.
We’re looking at you, Target, Walmart, Sears and BestBuy, sites that don’t have green tech or eco-friendly sections or search filters that make it easy to find the water-saving, solar, LED and more earth friendly tech items they carry.
Maybe big retailers don’t want to come off too specialized, or maybe they’re worried about implying other products they sell, outside of a special “eco” section, are somehow environmentally wasteful.
 Let’s admit it. Some of those electronics are wasteful. A wino, or possibly an arthritic sommelier could make the electric corkscrew worth its weight in rare earth metals. But who really needs a portable watermelon cooler?
Gift shoppers can’t rely on the media’s picks entirely, either. Several guides have recommended stuff this season that’s either utilitarian, or expensive enough to wilt mistletoe.
Treehugger suggested a $670 eMeter that measures a users’ energy consumption at home. Inhabitat suggested a water clock that duplicates time-keeping features of a basic mobile phone— but hey, it runs on lemon water so it’s “eco.” The biggest stinker was NetworkWorld’s recommendation to give the automatic, electric composter as a gift. Who’s naughty enough to get that  one? (It’s not even solar-powered!)
The most environmentally friendly gifts one can give are probably not things — shipped from far away, delivered by diesel trucks, destined for the landfill — but digital goods, like a must-read e-book or a membership to a streaming video site. We know.
Digital goods lack that whole je ne sais quoi of handing a loved one something they can tear open. Hopefully, it’s wrapped in 100% recycled and recyclable paper. We suggest using the comics section— save a tree and a little piece of the print news business.
Here at TechCrunch, we found a six-pack of sites that either specialize in, or have designated sections and great search filters for what we call green tech. These should help you find sustainable gifts for tech heads that are actually worth coveting, and should arrive in time for Christmas if ordered on or before December 15th.


1. Think Geek’s Power & Eco-Friendly section features a boat load of solar chargers, and LED lighting. The refillable, chemicals free air horn could delight a sports fan who’s into green tech, too.
2. GoGreenSolar.com is a specialty store with products to please home improvement and gardening enthusiasts, from a solar power generating system that doubles as a back yard cabana (about $10,000) to efficient LED grow lights for budding botanists ($30 and up).
3. Amazon.com has a special Amazon Green section. It’s not featured in home page navigation, but a quick search on the word “green” leads users there. The special section’s Green Electronics category features everything from energy-efficient laptops and netbooks to information on recycling the old to make way for the new.
4. The Overstock.com electronics section includes quick links to “Made in the U.S.A.” gadgets, and “Refurbished” items. Refurbishing is recycling, which makes it automatically green. Buying locally produced anything tends to eliminate emissions generated in shipping from far away. The United States also has stricter environmental regulations than China and other exporters.
5. 21st Century Goods, a specialty retailer focused on “off-the-grid” lifestyles, offers plenty of cute eco-friendly gadgets, from hand-cranked mini-USB device chargers ($14) to solar-powered flag pole lights that would make a good present for a proud patriot ($60-$130).
6. Dont’ let the yoga mats scare you at Gaiam. The sustainable web store also sells: recyclable water filters for home chefs and health nuts who crave pure hydration; energy-efficient hair dryers for the style addicted, and for the outdoor adventurer, a hand-operated, snake bite and insect poison extractor (a weird and inspiring stocking stuffer). 

Also worth noting:

If you have a giftee with a guilty conscience but a steady jones for Apple products? Belgrave Trust sells a $10 sticker that represents carbon offsets to counter the greenhouse gas emissions that scientists estimate are produced by the manufacture and use of one of Apple’s laptops or iPads over its lifetime. (image above)
For gift givers across the pond, this site delivers eco-gadgets to the Euro-paying market: EthicalSuperStore.com.

862,Thin Film Solar Catching Up To Crystalline Panels On Efficiency?,https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/08/thin-film-v-crystalline-solar-panels/,2010/12/08," The National Renewable Energy Labratory (NREL) recently tested thin-film solar modules made by MiaSolé, and verified that their energy conversion efficiency rate hit 15.7 percent, up from 14.3 percent last year.
The company boasted about the number, and several news outlets touted the results. Does it mean the performance gap between thin-film and crystalline solar modules is closing? Could thin-film take a bite out of the market for crystalline panels in the U.S., soon?
Clean tech analysts and engineers believe that thin-film solar is not likely to catch up to crystalline in terms of efficiency any time soon. Neither will thin-film solar modules steal market share from crystalline in 2011, they predict.
Thin film solar modules are made by a huge number of companies today including: Abound Solar, Best Solar, First Solar, Konica, LG Electronics, MiaSolé, PrimeStar Solar, Nanosolar, Sharp and Uni-Solar. Not all thin-film solar is created equal, however.
Today’s typical thin-film modules look like sheets of glass (image, below). Crystalline modules also look like sheets of glass but are thicker, and framed in metal (image, top of post). Uni-Solar’s thin-film modules, interestingly, are flexible and have a stick-on backing.

A senior analyst with Lux Research, Ted Sullivan, points out that there are a variety of thin-film solar cells in production today: MiaSolé uses copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) solar cells in their product; FirstSolar uses cadmium telluride (CdTe) cells, which are dominant sellers in the U.S. thin-film solar market today; while Konica and Sharp use silicon cells.
Of all thin-film technologies, CIGS modules demonstrate the greatest energy conversion efficiency, and power output per square meter. CIGS cells require less energy for production than crystalline cells. Thin film in general requires less expensive semiconductor material, and fewer process steps than it takes to make crystalline modules, according to NREL research.
Manufacturing costs keep the price of thin-film modules comparatively low, today. Solar analyst Sullivan explained, however, that thin-film solar manufacturers face a different challenge:


“There’s kind of a consistency issue for all [thin-film] players. Ideally, you want modules to be produced identically, so there is no variation between each module [especially once they’re installed out in the field].
CIGS thin-film solar production is the most highly variable as it involves four metal alloys and processes where impurities and other things can have a negative impact on the resulting product.” 

MiaSolé’s 15.7 percent rating, he noted, is important because it illustrates that CIGS thin-film solar technology is comparable to the current, low-end potential energy of silicon polycrystalline panels.
But thin-film solar manufacturers have to procure a greater variety of metals from sources far from the United States (mostly China today) leading to market concerns over trade war potential, a shortage of metals, and unfair labor and damaging environmental practices of mines.
Meanwhile, crystalline module prices are coming down a bit as production ramps worldwide. A solar engineer at GridPoint in Houston, Texas, John Gardner says both technologies have their uses, even in a world where they cost about the same.
 GridPoint sells and installs software, hardware and services to help organizations switch to clean energy in any form that will work best for their facilities and operations. Gardner says the company uses both thin-film and crystalline solar for client projects, but more crystalline so far, including in power generating systems they’ve installed for federal agencies, retailers and restaurant chains.
Gardner outlined some of the best uses and limitations of each technology:

“In a typical home installation, you’ll have a certain area, or amount of roof space where you want to place solar panels. If there’s a limited space, you’ll probably want crystalline to get the most power per square foot.
Structure or aesthetics sometimes dictate what you are able to install, though. We worked on one project involving a roof that could not handle the weight of crystalline panels.
Or let’s say you’re building a skyscraper with a glass façade. If you integrate thin-film type solar panels there, your building is now generating power with the same skin that was otherwise just glass.
If you have near unlimited space, say to build a solar farm out in the desert, you could consider thin-film because the modules cost less per watt. That said, labor costs to install a higher number of modules could offset the price difference, and crystalline might make more sense.”

On Monday, the world’s largest manufacturer of solar panels— SunTech Power Holdings Co. in Wuxi, China— announced it expects to have crystalline modules that have 22 percent conversion efficiency out in the market in the next three years.
That’s one more reason, Sullivan suggests, crystalline panels will remain dominant in 2011, especially in applications where space is limited. “Most of the thin-film technologies out there today will never get to silicon crystalline efficiency, which has just been around longer and is still seeing improvements,” he concluded.

863,Solar Impulse's Fuelless Plane Is Innovation In Plane Form,https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/08/solar-impulse/,2010/12/08,"
Dr. Bertrand Piccard took the stage here at Le Web 2010 to talk about his ongoing efforts to build fuel-less planes with a modest statement, “If you don’t read the NY Times you have never heard of Solar Impulse.”
Solar Impulse founder Piccard comes from a long line of pioneers, his father led the first flight in the stratosphere in 1931. On this Piccard elaborated, “Pioneering spirit is something that everyone else says is impossible, until everyone says it was obvious.”
The idea for Solar Impulse came from a promise that Piccard made to himself that he would complete a flight “with solar power, batteries with whatever, but with no fuel.” Like any risk-taking entrepreneur, Piccard is extremely hopeful about the prospects of fuel alternatives, “We have technology today that allow us to reduce our consumption of oil by at least 50%. And it’s possible.”
The big ideas inspired by the existence of a solar plane is the most important part of the whole project Piccard emphasized. It is an ambitious to say the least endeavor to try to make the world a little less dependent on fossil energy, especially since the price of oil is currently at $88 a barrel. “New technologies are vital for the future, but much more than that. So many people are not pioneers. Relying on habits is what we have to kill.” 
Because the construction of the plane was so out of the ordinary,  Piccard revealed that no tradition airplane construction firms would take it at first. In order for the whole no fuel schtick to work according to his calculations, the plane’s body needed to be 64 meters long and 1600 kilos (less than two tons), not an easy project. So he went to people who had no idea about airplanes.
Receiving funding from Omega, Solvay and Deutsche Bank in return for the privilege of getting their names on a side of a solar powered plane among other things, the Solar Impulse team now has over 70 people. One of the primary reasons Piccard is speaking at Le Web this year is to get more people to join the family. “If we don’t invent the future than we won’t make it to the next generation without some disaster.”
“Now we have something to show, we have an airplane,” said Piccard. But it’s more than a plane he insists again, “It’s a demonstration of what can be achieved if we manage to think out of the box and implement adventure in our daily lives.”

864,SunTech Power Forecasts Brighter 2011,https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/06/suntech-power-2011-outlook/,2010/12/06,"SunTech Power Holdings Co. (NYSE: STP) — the largest solar panel maker in the world— delivered an optimistic 2011 forecast to investor analysts on Monday.
The Wuxi, China-based company with significant market share and operations in the U.S. expects its sales next year to grow by a minimum of one-fifth, and its revenue to reach $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion, up from $2.78 billion to US$2.83 billion this year. Its 2010 revenue represents growth of 64 percent over 2009.
The president of SunTech America, Steven Chan, projected that the U.S. market for solar should reach 1,114 MW by the end of 2010; SunTech’s share of that should end up around 210 MW. He expects SunTech to sell 410 MW in the U.S. in 2011 as domestic demand for solar overall rises to 2,058 MW by company estimates.
Competition in the U.S. — especially from First Solar, Sharp and SunPower(NASDAQ:SPWRA) — took some market share from SunTech this year.
The Chinese solar manufacturer lacks the large-scale utility projects that SunPower, for example, has signed on to develop in California and elsewhere. Instead, most of SunTech’s sales have been generated by light-industrial and residential projects, and European customers to-date.
The company’s forecasts for technological developments were reasonably rosy.
Chief technology officer of SunTech, Stuart Wenham (image, below) said on the guidance call that the company’s solar modules, used in large-scale commercial applications, should demonstrate 22% conversion efficiency in the field within three years, conservatively.

SunTech currently offers solar modules that demonstrated a 19.2 percent conversion efficiency as measured at one of their installations in Australia. Solar modules with a higher conversion efficiency deliver more power per square inch of solar power-generating materials.
An increase to 22 percent, Wenham explained, would lower the cost of systems for potential buyers, and help SunTech meet demand for clean energy without increasing its costs to produce the modules.
The company’s newest products are made from “Pluto efficient crystalline silicon solar cells.” A 72-cell module, 5-inch wafer made by SunTech today has a power output of about 195 watts. The company’s newer Pluto modules will have a power output of 200 watts, Wenham said on the call.
The CTO bragged light-heartedly about one rooftop installation at the Sydney Theatre Company in Australia. Film star Cate Blanchett did the honors of switching the system on to promote clean energy, the theater and SunTech there in November.
(Blanchett, like Wendham, is Australian.)
Shares in SunTech traded 9 percent higher by the end of Monday, over the previous business day. But they were beginning to dip in after hours trading.

865,Hertz To Offer Electric Vehicles By The Hour,https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/05/hertz-ev-plans-2011/,2010/12/05,"Hertz Rent A Car is set to offer electric vehicles at an hourly rate starting December 15th in New York City, with expansion of the service to San Francisco, Washington D.C., London, up to 50 college campuses in North America, and markets in Texas and China by the end of 2011.
For what it calls the ConnectByHertz “car sharing” service in Manhattan, the company aims to make 20 electric vehicles (EVs) available by the second quarter of 2011. In total throughout the U.S. next year, Hertz plans to have 500 to 1,000 all-electric cars available.
The number of EVs that Hertz purchases for its rent-by-the-hour fleets will depend upon the availability of the cars, many of which have not begun to ship yet the company’s head of communications, Rich Broome, said Sunday.
Hertz has committed to purchase: the Nissan Leaf, the Mistubishi i-MiEV, the Chevy Volt, and electric cars from Coda and Smart, Broome verified.

The company will work with a variety of charging station makers, EV manufacturers and electric utilities to ensure there are enough chargers available to drivers where Hertz rents EVs and plug-in hybrids.
Broome explained the company’s decision to invest in and promote EVs and the “car sharing” model:


We spend in the billions a year on our fleets, and only keep cars in [them] for eight to twelve months… chang[ing] them out before a service or maintenance issue ever comes up.
At the same time, we serve customers who need cars for all different reasons. They may be families on vacation together, or people on business by themselves, people who want to enjoy a luxury vehicle, others who want something more economical.
Offering EVs is a continuation of a trend for us, of diversity and being first to market with new and interesting models. We were the first [rental company] to offer the Prius.
Traditionally in the U.S., a mark of adulthood is owning a car. Those habits are changing in some places, especially cities and college campuses for some good reasons. They’re not just environmental but personal financial reasons. We can help people think around the question: do I really need to own a vehicle?
We want people to be able to try these new EVs out, for something around or less than $10 an hour. When they do, hopefully they’ll see the cars are fun to drive, they handle nicely, the braking is smooth and they have nice acceleration.

Clean energy catalyst, investor and serial entrepreneur, Jack D. Hidary— who was a cofounder of Vista Research, Dice.com and a co-architect of the federal Cash-For-Clunkers program— worked with Hertz to set up the new EV service.
Hidary told TechCrunch:


“This will be the first car sharing provider in the country with a scaled EV program. There have been small-scale tests of EVs, but nobody has said we’re going to launch EVs into our mainstream fleet, in multiple cities around the world.
One thing that made this possible [for Hertz] today, is information technology. We have the digital commons. But there is an evolving ‘EV-commons,’ too. It includes the smart grid, and smart cars and information about where are the charging stations, are they available now or when will they become available.
That did not exist back when we saw the first EVs. Now you can look at a web app or a mobile app and see it easily as a consumer.
If you were interested in an EV before, you had to buy it and spend money on the charging station at home to drive a zero emissions vehicle.
Renting the EVs by the hour, and ensuring enough charging stations in those markets is a business model innovation. I see the business model innovation as something that is at least as important as the technological innovation.”

866,Google Earth Engine Revealed At COP 16,https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/02/google-earth-engine-launch/,2010/12/02," Today at the United Nations’ conference on climate change COP 16 in Cancun, Mexico Google.org introduced its latest philanthropic project, the Google Earth Engine— an analytics tool for earth scientists and conservationists especially.
Google.org dubs their product “a planetary-scale platform for environmental data & analysis.” A product web page said:
The Google Earth Engine brings together the world’s satellite imagery—trillions of scientific measurements dating back more than 25 years—and makes it available online with tools for scientists, independent researchers, and nations to mine [a] massive warehouse of data to detect changes, map trends and quantify differences to the earth’s surface…

The search leader also introduced the Google Earth Engine API— only available to approved partners at this time— to help researchers develop, access and run algorithms on the full Earth Engine data archive, using Google’s parallel processing platform.

Some early Google Earth Engine partners mapped surface water in the Congo and created a granular map of Mexico’s forest cover and water.  One scientist, Carlos Souza Jr. of IMAZON, the Amazon Institute of People and the Environment, a non-profit research entity, took original satellite imagery of Surui indigenous territory in the southern Brazilian Amazon (image, above) then analyzed it using Google Earth Engine to reveal forest damage in the region (image, below).

Google envisions their Earth Engine and API advancing a number of monitoring, reporting and verification efforts. Results could be: maps that show where ecosystem services exist and gaps where they are needed, reports that find and illustrate changes in the Earth’s surface over time, and visualization of land use trends as agricultural activity shifts in response to water shortages, rising sea levels, and other problems that result from climate change.
Countries are rallying to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing nations at COP 16 this year. Healthy trees and forests abate climate change, keep the air cleaner and food supplies stronger, according to the United States Forest Service.
Developing nations are (and have already been) most negatively effected by a rise in global temperatures as Kofi Annan, the former U.N. chief and Nobel Prize winner attests here. Keeping forests healthy in these regions could have a near-term beneficial impact.
In light of the COP 16 initiative, Google plans to donate “10 million CPU-hours a year over the next 2 years on the Google Earth Engine platform, to strengthen the capacity of developing world nations to track the state of their forests,” the company announced today.

867,Racktivity Racks Up $8 Million To Cut Data Center Energy Costs And Emissions,https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/01/racktivity-series-b-8-million/,2010/12/01," Racktivity— a provider of hardware and software-as-a-service that manages power consumption within data centers— closed an $8 million series B investment, the company announced today. The round was led by Partech International and joined by the startup’s seed investors Big Bang, along with a group of angels based in Europe. The company was founded in Belgium, and recently opened offices in Redwood City, Calif.
The chief executive of Racktivity, Marco DeMiroz, is a former Trinity Ventures partner, and serial clean tech and IT entrepreneur, who took the reigns from founder Kristof De Spiegeleer in June 2010. The company appealed to him then, and its new series B investors because, said DiMiroz:

“It is all about energy costs today. They have been skyrocketing globally! At the same time, data centers have been paring down their staff to run their operations more cost efficiently. You still need human interaction within the data center, though. Our hardware and software are designed to help people manage as many data centers as they need to, remotely. There’s no other venture-backed company offering both the hardware and the software that lets you do this today.”
Racktivity’s hardware— including “pizza box” and vertical power distribution units— is currently being reviewed and tested by Underwriter Labaratories, the de-facto authority for testing and listing electronics as safe and compliant within U.S. electrical codes. The company expects to attain UL-certification by February 2011, DeMiroz said.
Within the data center, Racktivity’s hardware and software-as-a-service is used to monitor installed equipment, generate real-time reports on how it is functioning and how much power the equipment uses, then automatically power down servers and routers that are idle.
With its newly attained capital, Racktivity plans to hire 20 more employees in the next year, and possibly set up manufacturing operations in the U.S. Its products are currently made in Europe. DeMiroz mentioned Racktivity plans to unveil a new “disruptive value proposition” in the spring, but would not elaborate on what features or products this would encompass.
Currently, Ractivity’s customers are data center owners and operators with 300 cabinets or more. The company also sells its wares to small and medium-sized businesses outside of this profile through a partnership with Zenith Infotech.

868,Motorola Buys Connected Home And Energy Management Software Developer 4Home,https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/01/motorola-buys-connected-home-and-energy-management-software-developer-4home/,2010/12/01,"Motorola has just purchased 4Home, the developer of home monitoring, control, and energy management software. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
4Home’s software platform essentially adds a technology layer to any consumer’s home. Services include energy management, home security and monitoring, media management and home health. The software allows consumers to control web-based content on their TVs, appliances in the Kitchen, home devices and digital media in one unified user-interface, and track their home energy usage down to the device level. The technology also has mobile functionality as well.
4Home will be part of Motorola Mobility, which is comprised of Motorola’s Mobile Devices and Home businesses. Motorola Mobility will soon split into a separate entity in early January.
The startup has raised over $9 million in venture funding from Pond Ventures, Parker Price Venture Capital and Verizon Investments. And apparently 4Home is growing. A recent VentureBeat article cited that 4Home grew revenue by 300 percent in 2009 and doubled its workforce.
Motorola also recently acquired location based mobile software startup Aloqa and reportedly bought 280 North in August.

869,"What Lame Duck? Senate Passes Food Safety Bill, House Expected To Follow",https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/01/what-lame-duck-senate-passes-food-safety-bill-house-expected-to-follow/,2010/12/01," On Tuesday, the United States senate passed the Food Safety and Modernization Act (senate bill 510). If the House also approves the bill, as expected, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will have the power to force food recalls when contamination is reported by consumers. The bill will also increase the stringency and frequency of safety inspections for food manufacturers and processors.
Last week, the senate amended their version of the bill to make farms with revenue less than $500,000 a year exempt from the new requirements. Direct-to-consumer sellers, including farmers’ market vendors, would also be exempt. The bill does not address poultry or beef products, which are regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
A managing partner at the venture and private equity fund Bradmer Foods, Adam Borden, predicted the pending regulation will compel mass and industrial food producers to hire more people, and invest in technology to help them track their products and oversee their facilities. Costs could be passed along to consumers in food prices, Borden believes. Bradmer Foods’ portfolio includes the acai beverage company Sambazon, the sustainable packaged seafood company Blue Horizon Wild, and the organic premium confectioners Charles Chocolates.
Critics of the Food Safety And Modernization Act, the Christian Science Monitor reports, contend that the regulations will put small food businesses at a disadvantage versus large industrial food companies. Borden believes these concerns are misguided, and explained:
“Small or growing processed food manufacturers usually acquire ingredients from relatively larger companies so that they can source them in high enough quantities to meet demand. It’s mostly primary agricultural providers of a larger size that will have to upgrade their systems under this bill. Local exemptions are built-in to protect the eat local movement, food trucks and more. It’s not such a divisive proposal, and it’s something that companies should be able to adapt to reasonably well.”

Federal regulations often spur demand for compliance-related technology and services, as seen in the finance sector with Sarbanes-Oxley. If the bill passes, Borden and other industry insiders have suggested food tech players stand to win new business.
The director of science and technology projects with The Institute of Food Technologists (IFT), Jennifer McEntire, sees particular market opportunities for companies that provide product tracing, enterprise resource planning software, packaging and preservative technologies.
McEntire elaborated:


“In particular with more expensive products, say spices instead of commodities like flour or sugar, I’d expect to see companies using something like radio frequency identification (RFID) tagging to trace pallets and cases or even individual packages in an automatic way through every step from [farm to table], noting temperature changes and more along the way.
For larger volume products that don’t have the value to warrant spending on RFID-tagging, which is still relatively expensive, companies might tweak and link their enterprise resource planning systems. A number of companies [like SAP and YottaMark] are already working with food manufacturers, processors and handlers to report on the origins and whereabouts of their products. If this bill passes, they’ll be able to provide a more granular report through linked systems, because all companies along the chain will be mandated to keep more careful records. We’ll probably even see food companies make the information available to consumers through apps and websites.
Finally, companies will want to avoid the appearance of contamination if their food is damaged from temperature abuse, or other issues, even just sitting on the shelf too long. There are a number of innovations that are promising and becoming more affordable, here around packaging and preservation.” 

Among available packaging and preservation technologies on the market are: non-thermal, UV light and high pressure proceses that kill microorganisms in food without damaging the nutrient composition and integrity of a product; and biosensors that can be added as components to a package that will warn consumers or grocers if any kind of contamination, spoiling or tampering has occurred before they sell or eat the product.

870,Countries And Companies Talk Climate Change At COP 16 In Cancun,https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/30/cop16-cos-countries-climate/,2010/11/30," The United Nations Climate Change Conference COP16 kicked off yesterday in Cancun, Mexico. Delegates from 192 nations are attending through December 10 hoping to determine a collective, international approach to slowing and preparing their countries for an increase in global temperatures.
Conference goals—  laid out at an opening address by Christiana Figueres, the executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)— include the establishment of: commitments from countries to stop deforestation, a fund worth approximately $100 billion-a-year by 2013 to help poor people cope with climate change, and mechanisms that facilitate technology transfer between nations.
Last year’s COP 15 conference in Copenhagen failed in its primary mission to draw countries into a legally binding agreement to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. After the event, however, seventy countries signed the Copenhagen Accord, a voluntary political agreement to address climate change. As part of the accord, the U.S. said it hoped to cut its greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020 but made no firm promises.
Studies published today by the Royal Society’s Philosophical Transactions A journal predict that world temperatures could rise by 4 degrees Celsius (7.2F) as soon as 2060 if humanity’s contributions to climate change go unchecked.
The effects of warming that aggressive would include everything from drinking water shortages, to the loss of marine life (and important seafood supplies) as oceans become more acidic. The costs for nations to cope with such changes would be astronomical.

Climate change deniers continue to shrug off studies illustrating how people exacerbate climate change. Although the heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases was demonstrated in the mid-19th century, skeptics still believe a rise in global temperatures is all natural, or that there’s little we can do about global warming save to accept it and adapt.
NASA rsearchers, however, have confirmed that the world has been warming up more quickly in the last thirty years than ever before [ed note: in recorded history] with the 20 warmest years having occurred since 1981 and all 10 of the warmest years occurring in the past 12 years, thanks in measurable part to greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human energy consumption and industries.
The executive director of the Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI) in Washington D.C., Carol Werner, says that even climate change deniers should hope for some COP 16 outcomes:

We would like to see a formal agreement between countries and companies to curb black carbon, or soot, produced from diesel, inefficient cookstoves and open burning heat and energy sources. And we would like to see continued, respectful negotiations led by the United States and China that will shape the way that countries agree to monitor, report and verify their energy consumption, production and emissions.
Transparency helps businesses and trade policy makers not just environmentalists, while soot in the air has preventable negative health impacts besides contributing to climate change, Werner notes.
If nations do not make concrete promises and legally binding agreements to address climate change, the private sector may outpace them quickly enough to make an impact. Hundreds of c-suite level executives are attending COP 16 and ancillary summits such as The World Climate Summit, Green Solutions, the World Business Council For Sustainable Development’s Building Bridges event, and the Climate Group’s Climate Leaders Summit.
EESI’s Werner says the COP has become a place where companies— perhaps even more than countries— now go to showcase their own clean technologies and environmental best practices, while lobbying for policies that will benefit, or at least not adversely effect their industries.

871,OPower Gets $50 Million To Drive Energy Efficiency Via Peer Pressure,https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/29/opower-series-c-50-million/,2010/11/29," The Arlington, Va. clean tech startup, OPower, closed a $50 million series C investment led by Accel Partners and Kleiner Perkins Caulfield & Byers (KPCB) and joined by the company’s earlier investors New Enterprise Associates (NEA) the firms announced Monday.
OPower’s software-as-a-service helps electric and gas utilities understand who their residential energy consumers are, and how they are using power. Home owners get access to OPower programs through their utilities. OPower’s applications let them see if they’re more or less energy-hogging than their neighbors, allow them to set personal goals to reduce their own energy consumption at home, and receive alerts if they’re headed for a large bill at the end of the month among other things that are meant to inspire a behavior change.
OPower’s chief executive Dan Yates jokes, “We get paid to tell people to turn out the lights and turn down the thermostat.” OPower’s series C deal came together in just six weeks and closed on Thanksgiving eve Yates said. Accel and KPCB contributed equal amounts.
A partner at Accel, Peter Wagner explained his fund’s decision to invest at this level in OPower:
“OPower focuses on one of the most important issues of our time— improving energy efficiency on a massive scale. [Their] model is a perfect fit with Accel’s strategy for the energy sector. We focus on opportunities where information technology and the internet can create value in large-scale markets while maintaining a high degree of capital efficiency.”

[Read: clean tech concepts that aren’t as political, capital- and materials-intensive as biofuels or electric vehicles.]
Accel’s portfolio is well-known for social web success stories including Facebook, Groupon and Playfish. Wagner noted:
“OPower can take advantage of the dynamics of the social web to motivate significant and lasting efficiency gains across millions of households, [while providing] deep consumer engagement that is extremely valuable to utilities.”

The company will use its new-found capital Yates said, “To radically expand our R&D effort, bring 50 more people on board, and above all to build more product.” The CEO would not elaborate on what specific features and applications the company sought to release in 2011. He said most of the new product would be designed for energy consumers, rather than utilities. (OPower also provides utilities with a system to help customer service reps manage relationships and handle inquiries.)
Currently, OPower’s 45 clients are all U.S.-based utilities. OPower has had lots of inbound inquiries, Yates said, including from foreign utilities beyond North America, but hasn’t decided where to set up overseas operations.
The approach of using peer-pressure to drive more environmentally responsible behavior at home could work well in nations like South Korea, where the cost of trash collection goes up for an entire community when just a few people within it— including embarrassing Americans— fail to keep recycling and refuse separated.

872,"John Doerr: ""Bigger than Billion-Dollar Greentech IPOs in 18 Months""",https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/29/john-doerr-bigger-than-billion-dollar-greentech-ipos-in-18-months/,2010/11/29,"
In the peak of the Internet bubble, a company’s valuation– and press attention– would soar simply by whispering the words “John Doerr is an investor.” But in early Web 2.0 days, the once-everywhere venture capitalist seemed to fall off of the tech press’s radar, at least when it came to Internet investing.
But boy, has Doerr made up for lost time this year: Keynoting both of our Disrupt conferences, holding press conferences at Facebook, and generally leading the charge on the messaging that Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers is serious about investing all over this mobile-social wave of digital innovation. The lastest move was his signing of Wall Street analyst Mary Meeker as a Kleiner Perkins partner– a deal he personally negotiated with Meeker, according to an interview we did with both of them this morning.
So I had to ask while I had him on the phone: Whatever happened to Doerr’s belief that cleantech was the next big thing? Don’t worry tree huggers, Al Gore and concerned climate change watchers, he still believes. And like some other VCs, Doerr says that 2011 will be the year believers start to get rewarded. “We still believe there are enormous opportunities in green technologies,” he said. “There will be bigger than billion-dollar IPOs in the next 12-to-18 months. But what’s going on in the Internet is tremendously exciting too. We can walk and chew gum at the same time.” (Meeker laughed and asked whether she was supposed to have done that during the interview process. There’s an all-hands investor retreat for the firm this week. I’m betting Meeker gets a case of gum from someone…)
Kleiner’s clean tech portfolio is here, and it includes a range of big bets like Tesla-competitor Fisker Automotive, regenerative fuel cell maker Bloom Energy, low-cost solar film maker Miasole, and smart-grid technology company Silver Spring Networks.
When I tried to press Doerr on which of these two opportunities he was more excited about, he wriggled out by saying he was most excited about working with Meeker. Yep, looks like the master of working the late-1990s media is back.

873,"Puralytics CEO On Cleaning Water With Light, Winning The Cleantech Open",https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/25/cleantech-open-winners-puralytics/,2010/11/25,"
 The Cleantech Open— a prestigious annual competition for U.S. tech startups that protect, restore, and reduce the negative impact of humans on the environment— announced its 2010 winners this week. Puralytics, a clean water startup from Beaverton, Oregon, took first prize.
The Puralytics team invented and sells a nanotechnology-based, photochemical water purification system that, in comparison to other available systems, can purify water more quickly, remove more impurities from it, and requires less electricity to do so. With 15 percent of the world’s total estimated 6.5 billion population lacking freshwater enough to live a healthy life today, companies with promising water technology are in demand, and could help abate a global water and humanitarian crisis.
The executive director of the Cleantech Open Rex Northen said, “Puralytics stood out because they have developed something that will have a tremendous environmental and social impact. Their technology lets you use LED light or sunlight as a mechanism to clean water, and it lacks the toxic output many others have. The team was also very strong.”
Puralytics’ chief executive and founder, Mark Owen, is a serial entrepreneur and inventor whose thirty-some successful patents (according to his own calculations) have generated over one billion dollars in revenue for companies he has worked for and founded.
Owen spoke with TechCrunch about winning the Cleantech Open 2010 National Business Competition, and how his latest innovation cleans water with light. An edited transcript of the conversation follows below.

TC: What environmental problem does your company solve? 
MO: Purifying water has been a dirty process using filters, membranes, cleaning chemicals and mercurcy lamps.  The systems in use today waste most of the water they’re trying to purify, and require a lot of electricity. With reverse osmosis systems, for example, about 80% of the water that could be purified goes out into the sewer.
We have a different way to purify drinking water or water for light-industrial and commercial use. Our system processes all the water, using half as much electricity, and doesn’t require you to produce anything toxic. It also removes things from the water that others cannot, like pesticides and pharmaceuticals.
The EPA just released a list of 169 endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) that they will track from now on in domestic drinking water. These are things that even in small quantities can cause health problems for some people [and animals] including caffeine. Our system removes them from the water.
TC: How does Puralytics’ technology work? 
MO: If I was explaining Puralytics to a classroom full of kids, I’d say, “There are little things in your water that may not be good for you. We use a special light to make those go away.”
We use LEDs to illuminate a nanotechnology coating we’ve developed, that’s on a mesh where the water flows through a main system. This technology is not filtering at all. What it is doing instead, is creating a chemical reaction that causes molecules to break apart and break down in the water.
The right wavelengths of light and this nanotechnology coating cause five photochemical processes that work to pull contaminants out of the water onto the surface of the mesh, then dump the energy of what’s been absorbed into the molecules to break them apart.
Most organic molecules are lots of carbons, hydrogens, and oxygen and a few other things. Essentially we break a long molecule apart, all the way down, and reform it as CO2 and water and minerals. We actively destroy contaminants in the water, but leave the minerals that are good for you in it. Other treatments take out minerals that are good for you. But ours does not.

TC: Can you see the process? 
MO: It isn’t really visible. You see a kind of purplish light. If you could, you might see something that looks like water turning into steam and dissipating in the air. Something is changing form in there.

TC: Where did you get the idea for this?
MO: My previous company was Phoseon Technology. I’m still a director. We actually make light emitting diode (LED) drying equipment that can dry inks, coatings and adhesives very quickly using little energy. If you have any Ikea furniture, they spray on the coatings to make it look good, and make it durable, and Phoseon lamps dry it in about three seconds.
I got to thinking about what else I could do with LEDs. The original idea was to replace mercury lamps that are used to kill germs in hospitals and in water with an LED array. It didn’t turn out to be efficient. There are other good solutions to killing germs, I learned. But there weren’t efficient solutions to take out chemicals and heavy metals and other things of concern from water.
Another thing that inspired me was a building I saw in Japan, within Tokyo’s Expo City. It had been sprayed with a coating that kept it from getting dirty. Sun activates the coating to break up dirt and chemicals on the surface, so it mostly stays clean. I asked myself if instead of making the building clean, you could make the water clean.
I brought together a team— experts in chemistry, optics and physics— and we started figuring out which wavelengths of light were optimum, what kind of nanotechnology we could use, what kind of coating was optimum, and all the other things that could commence this idea around 2007.


TC: Do you have customers already? Who are they? 
MO: We began shipping to customers in 2009. The majority have been industrial process customers. They need water that’s ultra pure for use in the lab, or in processes they use to make their products. Tap water isn’t clean enough. We are useful to pharmaceuticals, biotech and semiconductor manufacturers, and coffee franchises alike. We have several Fortune 500 clients.

TC: What’s next for Puralytics?
MO: I told you about our primary product, the Puralytics Shield, which uses LEDs to purify water for light industrial and commercial use. We have another one called the Solar Bag. It uses the same technology but without the LEDs. So, you have a nanotech coated mesh inside of a bag. You fill the bag with water, stick it in the sun, and the nanotech purifies the water over the course of several hours instead of a few minutes. This is going to be important for getting clean drinking water to people without access in the developing world.
One of our partners, Hydration Technologies humanitarian water division, is helping us sell the Solar Bag to nonprofits that can distribute it. We also work with different aid organizations around the world— including one in Kenya, and another one in Bangladesh— to supply our technology in developing world applications. We’ll be figuring out how to do more of this.
We’ve been funded by four government grants, a seed round, and now some prize money. We’ll be using that develop a next generation product and expand our market presence. But we’ll also be looking to raise growth capital, soon.
[Editor’s note: The national competition prize included $150,000 worth of business services, and $100,000 in the form of a seed investment from a consortium of investors: Wilson Sonsini Investment Company, Stiefel Family Foundation, and the Cleantech Open.]

It didn’t get off to the world’s greatest start, but like a few other venture-backed IPOs, lately it has been trading at nearly double its opening price.
Meanwhile, a few other cleantech companies have filed S-1s and several more are waiting in the wings, watching to see what the market does. To continue the Netscape analogy, 2011 could even see Elon Musk emerge as the new Jim Clark if one of his other companies SolarCity files, as some in the industry expect.
Nat Goldhaber of the venture firm Claremont Creek Ventures argues that 2011 will be the year of the cleantech IPO, and it’s not just because of those handful of hot companies are finally ready for primetime and bankers are itching to take them out. Several factors are finally coming together including general improvement in the economy, soaring global demand for energy and a sense that more favorable cleantech regulation is inevitable, at least on a state level.
Goldhaber joined me by Skype to talk about what sectors and companies could lead next year’s IPO wave and which company in his portfolio has him the most excited. (There’s also talk of jetpacks and robot butlers…)

876,Duke Energy And ITOCHU Testing New Uses For Old Electric Vehicle Batteries,https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/23/duke-energy-ev-battery-reuse/,2010/11/23,"Duke Energy and ITOCHU Corp. announced a partnership today through which they will evaluate and test new uses for old electric vehicle (EV) batteries. Once they are too spent for life on-the-road, EV batteries could store power and deliver a charge elsewhere, the companies reason.
EV batteries falling below 80 percent of their original capacity when fully charged will be candidates for replacement and reuse. Duke and Itochu promised to begin their project by testing Ener1 lithium-ion batteries extracted from a fleet of 80 EVs in a Duke Energy facility in Indianapolis.
The automaker GM embarked on a similar initiative with The ABB Group in September, specifically looking for ways to use spent Chevy Volt batteries in the smart grid. One vision of reuse for EV batteries proposed by GM would see them storing power from renewable sources in EV charging stations, which are used to charge plug-in vehicles.
Other ideas (as reported by MSNBC.com and Gas2.org) include using the weakened EV batteries to keep cell phone towers up and running during blackouts, or to stabilize the grid by storing power generated either during off-peak hours or from intermittently available renewable sources, like wind or solar, finally dispensing it during peak demand hours.
EV skeptics believe that production and recycling of EV batteries— at least until battery design and reycling related technology improves— might make electric vehicles more harmful to the environment than the highest-efficiency diesel models. That’s especially if a majority of electricity used to charge EVs comes from non-renewable sources, like coal.
Giving batteries a new life beyond the vehicle, and using them to shift electricity production to renewables as much as possible would quiet many of these worries. At the same time, companies like GM, Duke, ABB Group and Itochu hope that increasing the total lifetime value of EV batteries would ultimately reduce the cost of producing them as well.

877,NAVTEQ Study: Worst Traffic In U.S. On New York City Freeways,https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/22/navteq-nyc-worst-traffic/,2010/11/22,"NAVTEQ— the digital map, traffic and location data company— released a study today via its Traffic.com site and service naming New York City and its freeways as the most congested and traffic-delayed in North America.
Freeways in Montreal, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Boston and Toronto cracked the top ten on this dubious list as well. Following New York on NAVTEQ Traffic.com’s ranking of cities with the worst rush hour are: Washington D.C., San Francisco, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Chicago, Dallas-Ft. Worth, Atlanta, Houston and Denver.
This Thanksgiving holiday (Wednesday, November 24th to Sunday, November 28th) the American Automobile Association (AAA) and IHS Global Insight predict that the number of Americans traveling will increase 11.4 percent versus 2009, with approximately 42.2 million travelers overall and 39.7 million of them reaching their destination by vehicle.
Vehicles account for at least 25 percent of air-polluting emissions domestically, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reports. Numerous studies have linked traffic and related emissions to health problems that range from childhood asthma to higher risk of sudden heart attacks for people living within 300 to 500 meters from a highway or major road most effected by traffic. According to the Health Effects Institute in Boston, 30-45% of people in large North American cities live within such zones.
Stop and start driving causes vehicles from diesel buses to typical family cars to emit more particles including black carbon and volatile organic compounds, scientists at Queensland University of Technology in Australia found. That’s one reason air quality declines around traffic-congested areas.
In New York, areas with the greatest traffic density suffer three times the concentration of the pollutant nitric oxide, and twice the concentration of nitrogen dioxide, compared to areas with the lowest traffic density, according to the 2010 New York City Community Air Survey.
Drivers who avoid the most congested routes, roads with lots of stop signs and traffic lights, and who drive during off-peak hours hopefully with carpoolers can curb their impact on air quality, and the overall amount of fuel or energy they consume while traveling.

878,"Nlyte Closes $12 Million To Help Data Centers Last Longer, Use Less Energy",https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/21/nlyte-series-c-12-million/,2010/11/21,"Nlyte Software (formerly Global DataCenter Management) closed a $12 million series C investment led by NGEN Partners with Balderton Capital, Ruffer LLP and Montalcino Holdings participating in the round. The Menlo Park green IT company provides data center infrastructure management (DCIM) software and services.
Nlyte Software’s chief executive Jon Temple says, “We help data center managers with capacity planning, so there’s an efficient use of power, cooling and space, and optimal placement of data assets [within their facilities].”
Datacenter owners and managers can use nlyte to understand and predict: what’s in their ever-changing inventory of equipment; where every server or rack is located within their facilities; how systems that are run by this equipment may be effected as it is moved around; and how the data centers can be tweaked to operate more efficiently.
According to a new study from KTH’s Centre for Sustainable Communications, the global IT and telecom sector in 2007, defined in a way that excludes the impact of the increasingly digital media and entertainment sector, accounted for at least 1.3 percent of the world’s total greenhouse emissions.
Greenhouse gas emissions from cloud computing alone are expected to triple by 2020, according to forecasts by Greenpeace.
DCIM solutions— like those offered by nlyte, Emerson Network Power, and Modius— reduce data center energy consumption by 20% on an annualized basis according to Gartner research. Nlyte’s website claims its software can extend the lifetime of an existing data center facility by 75% or about 5 years.
Nlyte sells to businesses that have 100 or more racks in their data centers. “We’ve only seen one data center in one hundred today taking advantage of this type of technology which represents a huge opportunity for us,” Temple said.
IDC researchers have counted more than 106,000 data centers of this size in operation today. Cloud computing, outsourcing and other trends are contributing to increased demand on existing data centers, and the build of new data centers, Temple says.
Nlyte plans to use its series C growth capital to market its services in North America, primarily, with some expansion plans in continental and Eastern Europe, and Asia-Pacific Rim. With the investment, NGEN’s managing director Rosemary Ripley, will join nlyte Software’s board of directors.

879,"Resolute Marine Wins Startup Open, Converts Wave Energy To Clean Water And Power",https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/19/startup-open-2010-winners/,2010/11/19,"Resolute Marine Energy— a Boston startup whose technology harnesses wave energy for power generation, and transports seawater to on-shore desalination facilities— won Global Entrepreneurship Week’s inaugural Startup Open, the competition’s directors revealed today.
As their prize, co-founders and core team members of Resolute Marine receive an all-expenses-paid, one-day trip to the island owned by Sir Richard Branson where they will embark on a Maverick Business Adventure. These events draw groups of entrepreneurs together to network while engaging in some crazy activities, like cage diving with Great White sharks, off-road racing or kite boarding.
The Startup Open was run by the Kauffman Foundation, the Kansas City organization dedicated to the study and promotion of entrepreneurship, using iStart software (formerly StudentBusinesses.com) to receive, review and process applications.
Unlike typical business competitions, there was no final pitch event, judges did not meet to review applications, and winners were selected based on compiled judges’ scores. Winners were picked from a pool of 50 finalists. The competition received 144 qualifying applications.
The chief operating officer and co-founder of Resolute Marine, Olivier Ceberio, spoke with TechCrunch about his company and the win. The following is a condensed version of the conversation.

Q: What does your company do?
A: Basically, Resolute Marine Energy uses the incredible power of the ocean to produce drinkable water and electricity.
William Staby who is my co-founder and chief executive, and I really wanted to solve a serious global problem. Over one billion people today lack access to safe drinking water. Over thirty percent of people, meanwhile, are living within 100 kilometers of the ocean according to a study we read by the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center.
People who lack access to safe drinking water also usually lack access to the power grid or affordable power. Our small scale system converts energy from the waves into electrical power or into pressurized seawater, so we can provide both drinking water and clean, more affordable power.
Q: How does your technology work?
A: Our engineering team led by Cliff Goudey and Allan Chertok have been working on a wave energy converter that’s not portable, but easy to ship and set up. It’s somewhere between two and three meters of width. One power plant and desalination processor for a community of about 30,000 people would have fifty of these, perhaps.
The wave energy converter is like a paddle. It is attached to the bottom of the sea, or the seabed. When a wave starts, the paddle moves back and forth. It extracts energy from the wave, and we use that to produce either electrical power or pressurized sea water. It can produce one or the other. We send those to the shore to drive a desalination system. The technology transports energy, or it can transport pressurized seawater, which is an input to the desalination processing systems on-shore.
We have not created a desalination processing system ourselves. For that, we will partner with other companies. We have begun talking with some of the world’s largest providers of small scale desalination systems.

Q: Who are your customers? Are your systems out on the market yet?
A: We have an early stage customer with whom we plan to do a commercial product installation by the end of 2012 in South Africa. We’re considering that as our launch market. When we do our commercial pilot, the idea will be to install our wave energy converters, and a desalination processing system, then let it work for a couple of months producing water in a self-sustaining, off-the-grid way.
When we are ready to commecialize the system and install it, the wave energy converters will be in situ for 10 years or up to 20 years, and we will provide maintenance over that lifetime.
We have to test our system out before the commercial pilot, probably in New England most likely in Maine. In the U.S. three states that are very active in wave energy research are Maine, Oregon and Hawaii. But worldwide, the core of the wave energy industry would be in Scotland, and Australia with some others in Europe where governments really want to find and use renewable energy. I feel that U.S. has been somewhat behind in this.
Q: How will winning this competition effect your business?
A: Anything that can help us get to commercialization as soon as possible is helpful. These competitions are critical for us. They help you get endorsements, press, [access to new] networks, feedback on your projects and from the community beyond the cleantech professionals you know.
We competed at Ignite Clean Energy in 2009, which is now a part of the Cleantech Open, and at Masschallenge this year where we were among the finalists. We got in-kind services but no major cash prizes. We have also won several government grants. Surprisingly they are not near enough to pay for everything a cleatech startup needs.
We will be raising private capital to finance all the aspects of our business from intellectual property protection, to rent and marketing. We will also continue along the competition circuit, and hope to compete and win prize money from some that are focused on water technology.

880,NRG To Build Network Of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Throughout Texas,https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/18/nrg-houston-ev-stations/,2010/11/18," NRG Energy— a wholesale generator and publicly traded company— announced plans to build a network of 150 electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in Houston starting in February 2011, then to expand this network throughout Texas and the United States.
According to the most recent, annual Green Cities Index, 78% of Houston commuters drive alone, and the city ranked 38th, meaning it is one of the worst out of 43 measured U.S. cities in terms of air quality.
A spokesman for the NRG eVgo Network said, “We hope to use the infrastructure we have to reduce co2 emissions and put a dent in our addiction to overseas oil.” Houston’s new charging station network will include 150 of NRG’s eVgo brand ev charging stations, 50 of them rapid charging stations that can fully juice an electric vehicle in 30 minutes.
The stations will be installed in parking lots at retailers that partner with NRG, including Walgreens and Best Buy, and in the lots of large corporate and school campuses along Houston’s major thoroughfares.
The charging stations will be positioned at locations within twenty-five miles of the city center, easing what automakers refer to as “range anxiety,” (a fear that an electric car, if taken far from home, will wind up stranded and battery-depleted).
Electricity retailers including Direct Energy and TXU Energy partner with NRG to supply power plans to EV drivers. NRG also considers its own electricity retail divisions, Reliant Energy and Green Mountain Energy eVgo partners.
Customers who buy eVgo brand charging stations for their homes will be able to subscribe to plans from $49-$89 per month. At the highest end, the plan includes the cost of electricity, and unlimited charging sessions at their home and publicly placed, Houston-area charging stations. All the plans include the installation and maintenance of a charging station at home. At the lowest end, users pay for the cost of electricity and do not have prepaid access to publicly positioned stations.
Houston Mayor Annise Parker held a press conference with NRG on Thursday to unveil the charging stations network. According to the Houston Chronicle, she also announced the city would open its carpool lanes on local freeways to highway-safe electric vehicles, and that the city would try to get toll road operators to reduce fees for EVs.

881,Payback (And IPO) Time For GM As Chevy Volt Wins Industry Accolades,https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/17/general-motors-ipo-eve/,2010/11/17," The 102-year-old car company General Motors (GM) is set to go public on Thursday after a government-forced bankruptcy and bailout in November 2008. The bailout cost taxpayers about $50 billion. Analysts estimate the stock price would need to hit $53 dollars before the government can recoup its investment. GM plans to sell about half-a-billion shares for $33 each in its IPO. The company stands to raise an estimated $20.1 billion to $23.1 billion.
In a press statement late Wednesday, The U.S. Treasury Department revealed that it sold 358.5 million shares of GM, raising $11.8 billion, and hanging onto a 37% stake of the company. With underwriters chomping at the bit to buy more GM shares to cover over-allotments, the Treasury could reduce its stake to 33.3% and sell 412 million* GM shares raising a total of $13.6 billion.
The L.A. Times reports that the GM IPO would set a new record:
A $23.1 billion total would surpass not only the record set by the Agricultural Bank of China but also easily break the $19.7 billion record for a U.S. company, set by Visa Inc. in March 2008. However, Visa’s deal was all common stock, leaving it as the largest by that measure.

In other company news, GM unveiled its 2011 Chevrolet Camaro Convertible at the Los Angeles auto show today. Earlier in the week its new, electric vehicle (EV) the 2011 Chevy Volt won the title of car of the year from two trade magazines, Motor Trend, and Automobile magazine.
The Volt is not a pure EV because it has a 1.4 liter gasoline engine-and-generator that produces power and gives mechanical assistance to the motor that drives the car. The gas engine assists the vehicle in situations where a driver has gone more than 40 miles, and is operating at highway speeds around 70 miles per hour company representatives have told several media outlets. That said, the Volt still qualifies for government tax credits provided to EV-buyers, and primarily runs on electricity.
GM reported its 2010 third quarter earnings last week including a net income of $2 billion, and revenue of $34.1 billion. By comparison, Tesla Motors, a Nasdaq-traded company that makes truly all-electric vehicles saw $31.2 million in revenue, but a net loss for the third quarter of 2010 thanks to hefty research and development costs according to its earning reports. Shares in Tesla Motors traded just under $30 ahead of the GM public offering.
*[CORRECTION: In the second paragraph of this story, I mistakenly wrote “more” shares, but should have written 412 million total. The word “more” was removed from the passage on Nov. 18 to correct the story. Thanks to @pbones for bringing this to my attention. – LK]

882,Proposed Food Safety Laws A Boon For Clean Tech Companies,https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/17/proposed-food-safety-laws-a-boon-for-clean-tech-companies/,2010/11/17," Today, the senate voted to work on a bill called the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act that would, among other things, require food producers, facilities and distributors in the United States to evaluate hazards more rigorously, undergo more inspections each year and implement preventive measures to keep food pathogen-free.
Green tech companies that could benefit from higher standards for food safety provide: tests for e.coli, listeria, salmonella, and the geographic origins of food (IdahoTech, Picarro); energy-efficient refrigeration (NanoICE, CamFridge); and inventory management systems (Erply, OpenBravo).
With films like Food Inc. and books like Jonathan Safran Foer’s Eating Animals winning praise for investigations that reveal how commercial food and farming exhausts natural resources, pollutes the air and soil, and hurts human health on a number of levels, the bill seems timely at least.
If passed into law, it would empower the Food And Drug Administration to force food recalls. Today, food regulating agencies (the FDA and USDA) negotiate with food business owners who ultimately conduct recalls voluntarily, but are often too late to stop people and animals from getting sick, or too slow and ineffective to stop vast amounts of food waste.
According to the author of American Wasteland, Jonathan Bloom, about 25% of all food produced domestically is tossed and not eaten each year. The Center For Foodborne Illness Research And Prevention (CFI) reports that 76 million illnesses result domestically from bacterial contamination in food and water yearly, costing more than $10 billion, and leading to 325,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths.
In food safety news this summer, Wright County Egg in Iowa recalled hundreds of millions of eggs contaminated with salmonella. The company’s owners in 1997 paid a $2 million fine to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for workplace violations; they’d forced workers to handle manure and dead chickens with their bare hands, among other things.
More stringent inspections and food safety laws could make the dirtiest practices of factory farms cost-prohibitive. However, opponents of the senate bill (writing in Grist) believe the bill hurts the small farmer, and gives too much control to the FDA. They also worry that the regulations would cause untenable price hikes on food, thanks to increased fines for violations, and the cost of new technology and talent companies would have to attain and manage to become compliant.
A senior consultant with Sparta Systems, Katie Dowling, says the food industry is well overdue for a tech makeover, and food businesses could actually save money by improving operations. Sparta’s TrackWise application helps highly regulated businesses— like food, drug, pharmaceutical and medical device makers— manage quality issues.
Dowling says:

“One of the biggest technological challenges faced by food manufacturers today is that they have to know where their food was produced, down to the longitude and latitude coordinates where something was grown for any ingredient they use, or product they distribute. If there was cattle next to lettuce, there could be e-coli contamination going on… They need to know where it comes from.
Most of the systems food producers and facilities have been using until now— especially as you go back through the supply chain and get down to the farm level— they don’t talk to each other, they don’t record data in real time, and they dont’ track some of the most important safety data.
Smaller farms and food businesses think they can’t afford technology to do more than a manual report on Excel, but it is far more costly if they lose a major customer because they caused a problem, or if they have to pay fines if they don’t have appropriate documentation when the FDA shows up for an inspection.”


Dowling believes software and systems that work on mobile devices, or that use temperature controls and sensors in food facilities could be in high demand if the senate bill becomes law. President Obama has expressed his support of the proposed regulation, and in March 2009 launched the Food Safety Working Group to advise him on how to upgrade the U.S. food safety system.

884,"A Startup That Makes Data Centers Efficient, Smooth-Stone, Gets New VPs And A New Name",https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/15/smooth-stone-renamed-calxeda/,2010/11/15," Green IT startup Smooth-Stone today announced a new company name, Calxeda (pronounced “cal-zeh-dah”) and the addition of three vice president-level executives to its team: Karl Freund, Bob Baughman and Steve Beatty. The talent comes from IBM, Polycom and Freescale, respectively. Calxeda also launched a new website to reflect its rebranding, and moved into a new corporate headquarters office in Austin, Texas.
Founded in January 2008, Calxeda raised a $48 million investment in August this year from a syndicate of venture capital firms and semiconductor companies, including ARM, Advanced Technology Investment Company (ATIC), Battery Ventures, Flybridge Capital Partners, Highland Capital Partners and Texas Instruments Inc.
Calxeda designs and uses ultra-low power processors (like those found in mobile phones) to help data center owners and operators lower the amount of energy they require to run and cool their servers or other equipment, while also reducing the amount of space they need to accommodate their systems.
A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency report to Congress in 2007 estimated that if newly available technology were adopted by data centers in the U.S.,  energy efficiency could be improved by as much as 70%, and that saving a modest 10% of total energy used in these facilities would amount to energy savings of 10.7 billion kilowatt-hours per year— equivalent to the electricity consumed by one million US households and valued at the time of the report around $740 million.
Controlling costs, but not a wish to be more environmentally responsible, ranks as the top reason that IT professionals are increasingly using energy management and related systems according to recenty Global Green IT Online surveys by Forrester Research. Forrester also reported in 2009 that 45% of  IT professionals at global enterprises, small and medium sized businesses in the U.S. have already implemented, or are beginning to implement enterprise energy and carbon management systems (ECEMs).

885,"NanoICE Gets A Cool $500,000 To Preserve Food (And Possibly Human Organs)",https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/12/nanoice-gets-cool-half-million/,2010/11/12,"  A new SEC filing revealed today that NanoICE— a Seattle-area startup using molecular ice to chill and preserve meat, seafood and other raw materials as they are transported or stored— has secured a $500,000 investement (in the form of convertible debt financing). According to its website, the company’s customers include fishing vessels and food retailers today.
The systems sold by NanoICE produce molecular ice fractions, or ice crystals that are less than one micrometer in diameter. The “nanoice” can be delivered through something as small as a hypodermic needle, or in large quantities through hoses and pipes. NanoICE aims to curb food waste and end hunger, especially in the U.S., while displacing more energy-intensive refrigeration technology.
According to reports by the United Nations Environment Programme GRID-Ardenal (UNEP G-A), in the U.S. 30% of all food, worth some $48.3 billion, is thrown away each year, which means about half of the water used to produce this food is wasted. (Agriculture is the largest human use of water.) Food retailers lose about 26% of the food they store and try to sell.
Earlier this year, NanoICE won the Zino Zenith Award for Best Investment Opportunity from entrepreneurs and angel investors in the Pacific Northwest.
The company is also testing its technology in a medical context, while selling it within food industries; it may be successful in preserving human organs allowing them more time to travel from organ donors to transplant patients. Executives could not be reached immediately for comment.

886,"GE To Buy 25,000 Electric Vehicles Including 12,000 Of The Chevy Volt",https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/11/ge-ev-purchase-plans/,2010/11/11," Today, General Electric (GE) offered details about its committment to encourage the widespread adoption of all-electric vehicles. The company plans to walk the walk with a purchase of 25,000 electric vehicles by 2015, including an order for 12,000 Chevy Volt vehicles in 2011 from General Motors (GM), a GE business partner.
Within the next three years, GE expects to generate up to $500 million in revenue from the emerging electric vehicles market. GE owns one of the world’s largest vehicle fleets and global fleet management businesses. It also sells consumer and industrial products like the WattStation, an electric vehicle charging station, and circuit protection equipment and transformers.
Chief executive Jeff Immelt made GE’s intentions public through a series of deals and speeches this fall.
As part of its EV push, GE is also setting up “electric vehicle customer experience and learning centers,” to give customers, employees and researchers access to EV technology. One center will be in Van Buren Township, Michigan outside of Detroit, within GE’s Advanced Manufacturing and Software Technology Center. The other will be part of GE Capital’s Fleet Services business headquarters in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, with others to be announced in 2011.
The centers will monitor and evaluate vehicle performance and charging behaviors, driver experiences, service requirements, and operational efficiencies, while also affording the opportunity to experience a variety of manufacturers and models, and gain insights on electric vehicle deployment.

887,U.S. Patent Office Lets Green Technologies Jump The Queue For Another Year,https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/11/uspto-greentech-pilot-program-extension/,2010/11/11," The United States Patent And Trademark Office (USPTO) has extended its Green Technology Pilot Program to accelerate the review of patent petitions for green technologies defined as those pertaining to: environmental quality, energy conservation, development of renewable energy, and greenhouse gas emission reduction.
Applications are usually reviewed in the order they are received by the patent office, leading inventors and companies to delay commercialization of their technologies. This program lets green tech patents jump the queue without any extra fees or paperwork, and the USPTO hopes it will reduce average pendency times for green technologies by a year or more.
The program launched in Dec. 2009 and was to expire on Dec. 8th this year, but the USPTO on Wednesday announced an deadline extension until Dec. 31, 2011. So far, the USPTO had received 1,595 patent petitions and granted 790 of them under the Green Technology Pilot Program.
The program could prove controversial, as the president and founder of IPWatchdog Inc., Gene Quinn, suggests:
When has it ever been bad to encourage exciting new technologies?  An argument could be made that the Patent Office could and should expand this acceleration program beyond the green tech space and more broadly define those types of innovations that we as a society need most.  A one-size-fits-all patent system, or patent term for that matter, strikes me as out-dated.  Bacteria are becoming ever more resistant to Antibiotics and with more and more people in the world we need to continually advance food producing technologies…a one-size-fits-all patent system is out-dated.  Whether through acceleration or a longer patent term, we should be doing what we can to encourage those innovations society most needs.

888,Believe It Or Not: Plug In America's Electric Vehicle Hype Campaign,https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/10/plug-in-america-fabio-hype-evs/,2010/11/10," Here comes another spoof on the Mac vs. PC ad campaign, this one promoting electric vehicles over combustion engines. Plug In America, an advocacy organization that wants to reduce the United States’ dependence on petroleum, created the electric vehicle hype spots and calls them public service announcements.
The first of the seven PSAs include talent from the film Who Killed The Electric Car. One that’s slated for release on Nov. 30th features male model, Fabio.
In one spot, a character representing the stodgy, traditional auto buyer demonstrates the folly that could be a gasoline-powered cell phone.
In another, the stodgy guy is accompanied by a shady corporate lawyer and a rig worker covered in oil while his nemesis, the electric car driving hipster, shows up with a hippie goddess representing wind generated electricity.
The videos are embedded below, or viewable on Plug In America’s YouTube channel.
The campaign’s release follows a late October report by JD Power and Associates that  said EVs would only constitute a paltry 7.3 percent of global auto sales by 2020. The campaign just precedes the December 2010 initial sales dates (in Japan, Portugal, the Netherlands and the United States) for the first mass-produced all-electric vehicle— the Nissan LEAF.
Plug In America’s 7-spot campaign raises some good points about EVs— like how relatively quiet, emissions-free and low maintenance they can be— but it doesn’t address other concerns, like how to keep spent car batteries out of landfills, or how vehicles that run on biodiesel from waste or renewables, for example, might also help the U.S. solve its environmental and economic problems associated with fuel.

(CSHK) in Shanghai.
The company aims to build the world’s largest database of green technologies and entrepreneurs globally, and to create funding opportunities for these through its platform. Chief executive and founder of OnGreen, Nikhil R. Jain explains:

“Entrepreneurs post deals, or standardized summaries of their business plans and funding needs to OnGreen. More than 250 deals have been posted from 30 countries, with around 30% of those hailing from outside of the U.S. so far. [Desirable teams] are contacted by investors as a result of posting, and according to our September survey half of those who posted were contacted by potential investors. But entrepreneurs can also use the site to get feedback on their business plans and to network in what is a somewhat fragmented industry.”

According to Jain, OnGreen will use the series A capital to launch a Chinese version of its site, build its presence in China and India during the next year, and to launch a patent exchange in coming weeks (Nov. 16, 2010) a collaboration with the University of Southern California Energy Institute.
Currently, OnGreen plans to generate revenue through advertising, lead generation, events, custom clean tech and green industry research, and other sources. The company is on target to become profitable by the end of 2011, Jain says.

The Electronics TakeBack Coalition— a group that advocates for sustainable design and electronics producer responsibility— joined as a co-producer, framing issues and providing research for the script, working with Leonard’s long time creative partners Free Range Studios.
The Story Of Electronics, today, is a tragedy. Its main characters include: executives in charge of consumer electronics companies who allow their designers to use toxic materials and worse; consumers who accept built-in obsolescence and cannot control their appetites for everything from smart phones to high-def TVs; and citizens of developing nations living or working around e-waste, their land and water polluted by PVC, mercury, solvents, flame retardants as a result of another country’s consumer habits.
The video (embedded below) covers some startling facts about e-waste including:

Typical “fat” TVs, dumped to make way for flat screen, each have about 5 pounds of lead in them
It costs more to repair a DVD player than it does to buy a new one today
Every year, consumers create 25 metric tonnes of electronics waste
Computer factory workers, in a recent study, had 40% more miscarriages than the general population (thanks to exposure to toxic materials)

A national coordinator with The Electronics TakeBack Coalition who worked on this project, Barbara Kyle, added to that list:
“The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has found that we are still trashing about 85% of our electronics, with only 15% is getting into the hands of recyclers. We’re exporting a lot of that still, which means [America’s] e-waste strategy is to literally poison people in other parts of the globe. This has happened long enough that scientists have been able to go and find adults with high dioxin levels, and kids with high lead poisoning from our e-waste. We’ve got to look at the big picture here and think beyond ‘What does this product do for me,’ and ask ‘When I’m done with it, where will it go?'” 
The Story Of Electronics and Electronics TakeBack Coalition websites present ideas about how to turn the tragedy around, thankfully. Kyle suggests: 

Asking manufacturers to design and make more recyclable, longer lasting, non-toxic products
Sponsoring or participating in design competitions (like this one) that encourage sustainable innovation
When they’re spent, taking electronics to E-Stewards, recyclers that promise not to export them
Supporting legislation that would curb exports of toxic e-waste, at the moment the U.S. HR 6252
Buying from companies that take back electronics when they are broken or obsolete, to dispose of them responsibly

892,IBM To Give $50 Million In Tech And Consulting Services To 100 Cities,https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/09/ibm-giveaway-50-million-in-servicesto-cities/,2010/11/09," IBM today announced a plan to give away $50 million of its services and technology over the next three years to 100 municipalities through a program the company is calling the Smarter Cities Challenge.
Funded via IBM’s philanthropic division, according to an IBM press statement, the Smarter Cities program aims to help municipalities around the world— with populations of 100,000 to 700,000 ideally— solve local problems in any of the following areas: healthcare, education, safety, social services, transportation, communications, sustainability, budget management, energy, and utilities.
The approximate value of each Smarter Cities Challenge grant will be equivalent to US$400,000. The company has alrady completed or is currently conducting a series of pilot grants in Baltimore, Maryland; Austin, Texas; and Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. Other municipalities can apply online via SmarterCitiesChallenge.org, and will be selected based on a number of criteria including their track record of problem solving, commitment to the use of technology and open data, and willingness to provide IBM with access to and time with city leaders.
Teams of IBM experts will provide chosen cities with recommendations for better delivery of municipal services, more citizen engagement, and improved efficiency and access to proprietary IBM technology like the company’s CityForward, a kind of social network for city leaders, academics, and citizens that is also a city data analysis and data visualization platform.
The grant giving entity IBM stands to prime their sales pipeline by increasing their experience in Gov 2.0, Healthcare and Smart Grid verticals, with their generous, charitable effort.

893,"Maker Of Energy Efficient Air Conditioners, Coolerado, Closes $7.2 Million",https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/08/coolerado-7-million-pe-funding/,2010/11/08,"
According to a new SEC filing, Coolerado— the Denver-based manufacturer of super energy-efficient air conditioning systems for residential and light commercial use— has closed a $7.2 million investment led by NewWorld Capital Group, and joined by Spring Mountain Capital.
The relationship between the clean tech investors and Coolerado was announced in October, without any dollar amounts confirmed. Both funding organizations are based in New York.  Coolerado is targeting $4.1 million more for the round, the filing says.
Founded in 2004, Coolerado designs, makes and sells patented, energy-efficient air conditioning systems that the company claims can save buyers up to 90% in electricity costs affiliated with air conditioning.
Coolerado coolers, in contrast to traditional air conditioners, do not re-circulate air, nor do they use chemical refrigerants or compressors. Coolerado air conditioners (as described in this demo video) instead use thermodynamics, and water as a fuel for cooling. Some Coolerado units can run on solar power.
The company has sold its technology to customers in 21 countries already. Amusingly, its website is run on solar power from data centers that are cooled by Coolerado units.
With this round of funding, NewWorld Capital appointed three directors to the company’s five-person board: Bradley Abelow, Carter Bales and Ali Iz.

894,Suntech Bringing 9.43 MW More Solar Panels To Thailand,https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/08/suntech-thailand-solar-momentum/,2010/11/08,"Suntech Power Holdings Co. (NYSE: STP) has inked a deal to supply and install another 9.43 MW of solar panels at a plant in Thailand owned by Bangchak Petroleum, the companies announced today. The large scale plant will be grid-connected by late next year with a total capacity of 44 MW.
Thailand’s national goal is to meet 20% of its total energy consumption with renewable sources by 2022. The country is one of the largest energy consumers in Southeast Asia— according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration it was the world’s 23rd most electricity consuming nation, and was in the world’s top 25 carbon dioxide emitters in 2008.
Upon completion, the plant will generate renewable energy for metropolitan Thailand, primarily, which will be purchased and distributed by the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) and the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) under long-term power purchase agreements. In August this year, Suntech won the first phase of this deal, and was chosen to provide 34.5MW of solar panels and technical support for the new, Thai solar facility.
According to a joint press statement, EGAT researchers project that Thailand’s energy demand will grow by an average 4.22% annually by 2020. The country (like the U.S.) seeks to achieve greater energy security through the utilization of local, renewable energy resources.
Though founded in China in 2001, Suntech has North American headquarters in San Francisco, Calif. and operations in Arizona. The company is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. In 2008, it acquired El Solutions—  a California clean tech startup that supplied solar power generating systems for Google, Disney and other corporations— in order to build its U.S., residential rooftop and corporate solar business.

895,Geologists And Tech Industry Leaders Fear Mineral Trade Wars Imminent,https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/05/mineral-trade-wars-imminent/,2010/11/05," The Geological Society Of America (also known as the Geosociety) completed the installation of a solar power generating rooftop at their Boulder, Colorado headquarters yesterday. The project was funded by Xcel Energy and the City of Boulder, and installed by Bella Energy.
Good thing they bought into renewables already. The price of solar photovoltaic panels could rise steeply if the Geosociety’s predictions about mineral trade wars come true.
The group of 17 minerals in the rare earth category go into everything from missile guidance systems and mobile phones, to flat screen TVs, lasers and new energy technology. Pending scarcity— driven by increases in global demand, and China’s near-monopoly on the minerals market— could lead to prices that eat into industry margins, a slow down for clean tech projects worldwide, and diplomatic clashes between supplier nations (China) and buyer nations (U.S., Germany and Japan).
Rare earth minerals are essential to build photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, fuel cells and vehicle batteries. As widely reported, including by the Geosociety, BBC and the New York Times, some 97% of the global supply of rare earth minerals now comes from China.
Canada, Australia and the U.S. used to have more global market share, and rare earth minerals mines but the relative value of the currency, and relaxed-to-poor environmental regulation of mines in China made sourcing there favorable for buyers.
A trade war is imminent, James Burnell of the Colorado Geological Survey explained in the Geosociety report:
“China is preparing to build 330 giga-watts worth of wind generators. That will require about 59,000 tons of neodymium to make high-strength magnets — more than that country’s annual output of neodymium. China supplies the world with a lot of those rare earth elements, like neodymium, and will have little or none to export if it moves ahead with its wind power plans…So the source for the West is problematical.”

Earlier this month, during the East Asia Summit, Chinese officials told U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that Beijing aims to be a reliable minerals supplier and would not impose bans on exports of industrial minerals for political purposes. Sec. Clinton reportedly expressed gratitude, but requested further details on China’s export policies and new assurances.
Today, Reuters reported, 35 global business and trade associations— including the Consumer Electronics Association and the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and other major consumers of rare earth minerals— called on the Group of 20 (G-20) summit of the world’s 20 largest economies to address scarcity and trade war concerns at their forthcoming meeting, Nov. 11-12  in Seoul.
Officials from Japan and Germany have already complained that their automotive, and clean tech industries have been adversely impacted by China’s tightening of mineral exports. China has denied the implications of market manipulation and political motivations to reign in mineral exports. The country’s officials said China was trying to control some of the negative environmental impacts of mining, instead.

896,Women 2.0 CEO On 2010 Competition Winners: They're Not Like Facebook (In A Good Way),https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/05/2010-women2-competition-winners/,2010/11/05,"
This is a guest post from Shaherose Charania, founder and chief executive of Women 2.0, a social venture that aims to increase the number of female founders of technology startups. Ms. Charania previously served as the director of product management at bothJAJAH (acquired by Telefonica/O2) and Talenthouse, and as a managing partner at Opinno.
Women 2.0 is not an organization just for women— we created the name when some colleagues and I went to the Web 2.0 Expo conference in 2006 and asked, “Where are the women in the web 2.0 movement?” We didn’t see them represented there. Women 2.0 is more about diversity, inclusion, technology and startups that are likely to create jobs and wealth, and otherwise improve our lives and work. We have a clear goal of advancing high-growth businesses and innovation in technology.
Last night, as part of our Women 2.0 Startup Competition Pitch 2010, we heard pitches from an eclectic group of tech startups with female founders. Women were definitely represented. The event— which was organized end to end by my co-founder Angie Chang— took place at Twilio’s headquarters in San Francisco. Finalists demoed everything from mobile payments, language learning and expense tracking apps, to a tween social network and waste to industrial products technology.
Teams that qualify for our competition include at least one female co-founder. She doesn’t have to be the chief executive, but that is what we saw in more than 80% of the teams this year. Competitors must also be in a beta stage with their technology. We excluded startups that had already obtained more than $2 million in funding.
The competition drew 130 qualified applicants this year. Business ideas poured in from around the world. We had applicants from New Zealand, Turkey, Korea, Germany, Canada, Russia, Israel, Brazil, the U.K. and of course the U.S. Given the volume of strong applications we received, we decided to give out three industry awards for web, mobile, and cleantech pitches.
Our judges were investor and tech all-stars: Cindi Choi (SunPower), Cynthia Ringo (DBL Investors), David Weekly (PB Works), Gautam Gupta (General Catalyst Partners), Janice Roberts (Mayfield Fund), Julia Hartz (Eventbrite), Maria Kermath (AT&T Interactive), Naval Ravikant (Angelist) and Rachel Pike (Draper Fisher Jurvetson).

The cleantech category winners (photo, left) won a meeting with angel investor and social innovator, Esther Dyson. Judges picked Biolumber. Cofounder Kristin Kaune explained that her company takes plastic headed for the landfills and makes it into “lumber” that is as light as wood, and as strong as steel. Biolumber could reduce landfill waste significantly, I think.
Our web prize went to a company called Apply In The Sky, co-founded by Emily Chiu and Chiara Piccinotti (photo, below right). They are trying to make the process of applying for business school easier on the applicants, they said. The team earned a meeting with Mike Maples Floodgate co-founder, serial entrepreneur and investor.
I think Apply In The Sky is in a space that needs serious help. No company that I’ve seen is tackling the application process for b-schools, specifically. They’ve designed a nice, lightweight application for a very intense process. I think they’ll succeed with strong outreach to future MBA students.

PrePay Nation took our mobile industry prize. The company provides a payment service for users of basic feature phones. They take advantage of existing transaction technology that works to track minutes or allow you to buy more on these phones. Rather than reinventing the wheel, they’re using a top up approach that helps people transfer money to each other, or deliver micro-payments without the expenses and complexities of a wire transfer or money order.
Women 2.0’s Pitch director Aihui Ong told me she thinks PrePay Nation has a huge market opportunity with American immigrants who are predominantly users of basic feature phones. An investor who judged the mobile track, Gautam Gupta from General Catalyst Partners, told me Prepay Nation seemed promising to him because the company leverages several trends in the mobile ecosystem to provide their unique remittance service.
The company’s cofounder Jessica Bishop (in photo below) says PrePay Nation in 2011 should grow its business in North America, while expanding into the Middle East, Europe and Australia, and developing further integrations with mobile operators.

I was personally excited to see Women 2.0 teams thinking in a geographically broad way about their market opportunities, and including team members from other parts of the world. Many teams had intergenerational founders, with men and women alike. You would not expect that from reading the constant press on the collegiate genesis of Facebook. But there is another technology startup reality. Women 2.0 startups are not like Facebook, but I mean that in a good way.
Women from all over the world, and all ages are starting tech companies, and they don’t exclude men. It’s not just consumer web or healthcare, but every industry— we are thrilled to be among the first to see and review their technologies, and generally support their growth.
In the past three years of Women 2.0 Pitch Nights, we had to go home after celebrating to prepare meeting agendas or product requirements for our “day jobs” at Silicon Valley startups. This year was a different experience for me and my co-founders. Today, we’re happy to announce that The Kauffman Foundation is giving Women 2.0 a $50,000 sponsorship for our next six months of  programs and events. The foundation normally funds non-profits, but we operate as a for-profit, for-good entity which makes us especially grateful for their support.
With the funding, we’re getting ready for our 2010 Founder Labs. It’s Women 2.0’s pre-incubator program for aspiring entrepreneurs who aren’t ready to quit their day jobs. Once they’ve created a minimum viable product over five weeks at Founder Labs, we hope they will, however, strike out on their own.

897,RecycleBank CEO: We Will IPO In 2013 (TCTV),https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/05/recyclebank-ceo-we-will-ipo-in-2013-tctv/,2010/11/05," 


About one month into his role as RecycleBank’s new CEO, Jonathan Hsu is rattling off some ambitious numbers: An IPO by 2013, plans to grow his staff from 150 to over a thousand by 2012, and to reach nine-figures in annual revenues in that same year. That’s a herculean task for any company but especially one that plays in the labor and capital intensive world of recycling.
And yet, sitting in his new office in New York’s West Village, Hsu seems utterly confident, framing each prediction with a when-not-if mentality.
The well-funded RecycleBank— which has raised more than $70 million from VC firms like Kleiner Perkins, RRE Ventures and Sigma Partners— is a recycling rewards program that works with municipalities and large corporate sponsors, like P&G and Kashi, to install local programs in US and UK cities.
Under RecycleBank’s program, a household signs up for an account online and receives a special bin or “smart cart” for their recyclable waste that is equipped with a unique RFID-tag. When the hauler arrives to remove the waste, the cart is weighed and the household’s account is credited with points based on that weight. Those points can be redeemed online for rewards or savings with more than 1,000 local and national businesses.
Since its inception in 2005, RecycleBank has installed itself in more than 300 cities in the US and UK, with 3 million-plus households under contract. According to Hsu, revenues have been tripling every year, for the last two years, and the company is very close to profitability.
Hsu, who was formerly the CEO of 24/7 Real Media (an online marketing firm firm acquired by WPP for $649 million in 2007), was brought on to get the firm solidly in the black and to use his marketing background to help the company achieve tremendous— some might say unrealistic— growth offline and online.
“One of the things I will bring to bear in this company is the ability to grow to a mass market scale so that RecycleBank can be the first green mass market brand,” Hsu says. “This company will IPO in the next several years.”
So what is Hsu’s battle plan to get RecycleBank ready for a 2013 IPO— an IPO that he says will value the company in the multi-billion dollar range?
Hsu has three priorities: a new revamped online portal that leverages social tools, increased corporate sponsorships and a major push to get RecycleBank in new cities.
According to the CEO, he wants to work with municipalities to create hundreds of hyperlocal online destinations, to connect the users within RecycleBank communities. These new sites will feature social chat, gaming, a bulletin board for neighborhood announcements and a schedule of local activities. Calling it “Facebook with a purpose,” he says he doesn’t “want to reinvent the wheel of how people communicate but we want to leverage those tools successfully.”
Currently, RecycleBank makes the bulk of its revenues from its deals with municipalities— local governments pay the company a fee for diverting waste from landfills. The company also gets money through corporate sponsorships, but it only has a few dozen of these partnerships today. Over the next few years, RecycleBank plans to dramatically expand its portfolio of lucrative sponsorships, and Hsu predicts, eventually the amount of dollars coming in via sponsorships will significantly outweigh the amount from municipalities.
However, if RecycleBank wants to become a truly, global green, mass market brand, it will need to find a way to crack the markets outside of the US and UK. For example, given China’s rapid urban development and 1.3 billion strong population, it is a rising power player that is creating significant economic growth— and by extension, mountains of waste. It may be relatively easy to deploy millions of “smart cans” to households in highly developed countries, but it will be interesting to see how the RecycleBank program fares in the world’s major developing regions.
Hsu says he wants to tackle the larger international picture but it will be a challenge to do it directly (at least in the near term), because of their ambitions at home and in the UK. At least for the next few years, he wants to stay focused on expansion in these markets, and perhaps, link up with international partners to address other regions. The arms-length approach will likely blunt RecycleBank’s effectiveness in new markets, but it’s a start.
Hsu has a long way to go before he proves himself to his staff and RecycleBank’s investors— and he’s giving himself a short runway to do so— but he says he’s happy to have at least impressed one very important critic: his three-year old daughter.
“I really cherished my time at 24/7 Media…but it was hard for me to describe to my daughters what exactly I did. So I would show them a website, like Weather.com and show them the banner ads that they see on the top and sides and say to them abstractly, “Daddy’s company helps show those ads.” And they would nod to me, and they loved me because they’re my daughters but at the end of the day they didn’t really understand. Today when I tell my daugther…I show her the recycling bin and the trashbag and she can see how my company can move from the waste bucket to the sustainability bucket, she understands. She understands that daddy helps put less garbage on the street.”

898,Tesla Co-founder's Wrightspeed Raises $5 Million Series A Round,https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/05/tesla-co-founders-wrightspeed-raises-5-million-series-a-round/,2010/11/05,"Wrightspeed, a maker of fuel efficient, electric drive systems, has raised a $5 million Series A round from an unnamed private investor. According to the company’s press release, co-founder and EVP of Infinera, David Welch, will also join the company’s board.
The company’s founder and CEO is Ian Wright, one of the co-founders of Tesla. Although Wright was an important figure in Tesla’s early days, he left long before the IPO to found Wrightspeed. Wrightspeed doesn’t want to be the next electric automaker, instead, the company wants to build the best hybrid electric drive systems for high-performance cars and medium to large-sized trucks.
In other words, the company has no use for the minivan market— at least not today— its equipment is designed for extreme race cars or hefty, long haul trucks, racking up hundreds of miles per day. The goal, according to Wright, is to sell “technology [that] will displace at least 3,000 gallons of fuel per year per high usage vehicle.”
The San Jose-based company’s marquee product is the Wrightspeed Digital DriveSystem (DDS). The platform, according to the company’s website, includes “the battery system, electric motors and drive electronics, generator control system, vehicle dynamics control, user interface and the software control plane.” The DDS’s electric motors can reach 250 hp and are  built to be lightweight at roughly 40 pounds. In order to enhance flexibility, the system also uses motors modularly, so it can conform to what a vehicle needs.

899,Kleiner Perkins And CRV-Backed iControl Now Controls uControl As Home Automation Market Consolidates,https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/04/icontrol-ucontrol/,2010/11/04,"
The home automation market is consolidating, as evidenced by a the merger today of iControl and UControl.  Both offer home monitoring, security, and energy management products accessible through the Internet and mobile phones. For instance, with iControl’s iPhone app, you can lower your thermostat from work.
The value of the deal is not being disclosed, but Texas-based UControl will become a subsidiary of iControl and the name of the merged company will remain iControl Networks.  The two CEOs, Paul Dawes and Jim Johnson, will remain as co-CEOS.  John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins will remain on the board.  IControl, which was first backed by Charles River Ventures, has raised $44 million in venture capital so far, compared to about $24 million for UControl.  The combined company will have about 100 employees, with roughly two thirds coming from the iControl side.
Both companies distribute their products through partners, primarily broadband cable and phone companies for uControl and security monitoring and utilities for iControl.  The largest home security companies in the U.S., ADT, is just now rolling out ADT Pulse, which is powered by iControl, for instance.  Both are in the early stages of rolling out their services with various partners, with a total of low tens of thousands of consumers using the service right now.  But that could grow very quickly to hundreds of thousands of consumers by next year.  The way the economics works is that iControl gets maybe a couple dollars a month per subscriber.

900,FirstEnergy Tests The World’s Largest Mobile Fuel Cell System,https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/04/firstenergy-largest-mobile-fuel-cell/,2010/11/04,"
FirstEnergy and Ballard Power Systems are introducing a portable fuel cell that is scalable and is designed to take demand off the power grid.
While fuel cells have been powering manned spacecraft since the Gemini V mission in August 1965, their use here on Earth has been rather limited. But that’s slowly changing. The Japanese are building fuel cells into homes, for instance.
But Akron, Ohio based FirstEnergy Corp. wants to use large fuel cells to supplement power generation. Its tractor-trailer sized fuel cell is the world’s largest mobile system that’s been deployed to date. It’s supposed to ease the energy demand during the hot, summer months when FirstEnergy’s power grid is under the most pressure.
The fuel cell was purchased from Ballard Power Systems. The one-megawatt, hydrogen-powered fuel cell, also known as a proton exchange membrane fuel cell, can power 500 homes. Situated at a coal power plant in Eastlake, Ohio, the 54-foot PEM fuel cell is expected to handle peak loads from May through September.
Fuel cells don’t run out of power like batteries do. As long as a fuel source such as hydorgen gas is supplied, hydrogen and oxygen can produce water and heat to power homes.
“This is a demonstration project. But if it works, it will be easy to scale up,” said FirstEnergy spokesperson Mark Durbin. The nine fuel cell system will be tested over the next five years, which is enough time to see how it performs in the real world
FirstEnergy’s proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell is different from other cells, such as those produced by Bloom Energy.
The technology is different because Bloom Energy uses solid oxide fuel cells. This fuel cell is powered by more plentiful gas-based fuels, which helps cut costs.
Also, Bloom Energy’s $800,000 portable power plants, nicknamed Bloom Boxes, are only the size of industrial refrigerators. And it only takes a single 100 kilo-watt unit to power 100 homes or a 30,000 square-foot office building.
Another key difference is the temperature the fuel cells run at. Bloom Boxes operate at high temperatures, while PEM fuel cells run at room temperature. This makes the fuel cells more attractive in different markets. For instance, the automotive industry would prefer the PEM fuel cells over the other types.
Bloom Boxes are better suited to satisfy corporate needs rather than those of utilities. Bloom Energy recently sold its boxes to major companies like Google, eBay and Walmart.

901,"Facebook Claims It's All Green Now, Touts Auto-Flush Toilets",https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/04/facebook-claims-its-all-green-now-touts-auto-flush-toilets/,2010/11/04,"In an effort to promote its sustainability efforts, Facebook has officially launched the company’s “Green” page. The page, represented by what appears to be the merger of a restart button and an abstract pine tree, will showcase the company’s latest green achievements, pertinent articles and a bevy of fun facts.
Under the “programs” tab there’s an official list of Facebook’s recent achievements, highlights include the company’s construction of Haystack to more efficiently store photos (which led to energy savings of 20%), its green transportation system and yes, those AUTO/Dual flush toilets at its headquarters.
The Green page is just part of Facebook’s increasingly aggressive campaign to ratchet up its sustainability efforts— or at least broadcast its green agenda to the public. This Thursday morning, Facebook also announced that it has joined the Digital Energy Solutions Campaign (DESC), a consortium of NGOs, regulators and consumers that promotes energy efficiency in the information and communications technology sector. DESC will be the first co-administrator for Facebook’s Green page, which will eventually feature other environmental experts as co-administrators.

“Our on-going philosophy has been to improve the efficiency of our infrastructure and we continue to invest tremendous resources to improve our own operations,”Jonathan Heiliger, VP of Technical Operations at Facebook said in a statement. “By creating and sharing innovative technology solutions, we hope to help raise the visibility of the importance of environmental sustainability across all industries.”
Today’s two-for-one announcement also comes in the wake of Facebook’s recent partnership with the Alliance to Save Energy, a large coalition of environmental leaders and major corporations like Dell and AT&T. Last week, Facebook agreed to give the Alliance $500,000 in free advertising on its site, to promote the campaign and its new consumer-facing website, LivingEfficiently.org.
The initiatives come amid growing criticism from certain environmental groups, like Greenpeace, which have complained that Facebook has not done enough to promote sustainability and energy efficiency. This year, Greenpeace has pressed Facebook to make its data centers greener by using more renewable energy. The group took particular offense to Facebook’s new data center in Prineville, Oregon, which is powered by  Pacific Power, a utility firm that draws significant energy from coal plants.
The months-old saga hasn’t died down yet, on Wednesday, the NYTimes ran an article titled, “Facebook Under Pressure to Be Greener,” which detailed the tension between Greenpeace and Facebook and the social network’s ongoing challenge to be energy efficient as it scales up.
Seems like the perfect time to publicly launch a Green page.

902,"""Carb"" Cutting To Proceed On Schedule In California, Voters Nix Prop 23",https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/04/carb-cutting-cal-prop23-fails/,2010/11/04," Groups that sought to postpone air pollution controls in California lost at the polls on Tuesday. An estimated 61 percent of California’s voters said no to proposition 23, and yes to keeping the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, Assembly Bill 32 (AB 32) on schedule. The laws aim to cut the state’s industrial carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions back down to 1990 levels by the year 2020 and are slated to take effect in early 2012.
What does AB32 mean for businesses in California and the U.S.?
A principal with the global, economic research firm The Brattle Group, Jurgen Weiss said that AB32 and the changes it brings to the Golden State’s economy would not be problematic for a majority of traditional small businesses (and early stage startups) there.
The Brattle Group researchers project that by 2020 a restaurant in California will probably have to increase its prices from $50 to $50.07 due to AB32 effects on the cost of energy and goods, locally. Weiss explained, “The levels of impact will be minor for small businesses and early stage startups, generally. That’s because [most of these] aren’t energy intensive. The price increases likely to result from AB32 are actually smaller than increases that result from other things that change for small businesses year to year anyway, like the price of gasoline and natural gas for heating. Both of those fluctuate by a much higher percentage, regularly.”
On the other hand, price sensitive businesses and companies in energy intensive industries could feel a pinch, The Brattle Group projected. Opponents to AB32, and those who supported proposition 23 in California continuously express concerns that if the costs of energy and goods in California go up, but they do not go up at the same rates elsewhere, that will drive some companies to take their jobs and dollars out-of-state.
Weiss, based on his firm’s extensive research believes, “The types of companies that would be tempted to [move] are incredibly energy intensive, or price sensitive. If electricity prices going up even a few points would be a major increase in costs to them, they might want to move… Energy intensive industries include things like aluminum smelters, and pulp and paper companies.” A lot of these would not be found in California now, Weiss pointed out, because energy prices there have been high historically compared to other parts of the country.
Forbes reported that the defeat of proposition 23 comprised a win for the solar industry and that the state could expect to see more solar manufacturing jobs, soon. The Houston Chronicle reported that fuel prices in California could rise ahead of the Jan. 1, 2012, when oil refineries and power plants there will have to limit their greenhouse gas emissions.
Given California’s history of spurring new industry and innovation, AB32 proponents hope that the environmentally progressive law will not just abate pollution, but actually create demand for a new set of goods and services, and along with it plenty of local cleantech jobs and new businesses.

903,"Panasonic Invests $30 Million In Tesla, For 2% Stake",https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/03/panasonic-invests-30-million-in-tesla-for-2-stake/,2010/11/03,"Consumer electronics maker Panasonic is cozying up to Tesla with a $30 million investment, in exchange for a 2% stake.
Although Panasonic and Tesla have worked together in the past, under the new partnership, the duo will closely collaborate on the development and marketing of new Tesla battery packs that feature Panasonic lithium-ion cells.
“Panasonic offers the highest energy-density cells and industry-leading performance with cutting edge Nickel-type cathode technology.” Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a statement late Wednesday, “We believe our partnership with them will enable us to further improve our battery pack while reducing cost.”
Under the terms of the deal, Panasonic purchased Tesla’s stock in a private placement for a price of $21.15 a share.
The structure of this alliance is not out of the ordinary for the electric car maker, which has been richly funded but deficient in profits.  Over the past two years, Tesla has strengthened strategic relationships with investment deals.
Notably, in May, Tesla and Japanese automaker Toyota announced a major partnership to cooperate on the development of new electric vehicles.  As part of the deal, Toyota agreed to plunk down $50 million for Tesla’s common stock. And Toyota was not the first major corporation to bet on Elon Musk’s roadster. In 2009, Daimler invested an equivalent sum in exchange for a 10% stake and technology, according to reports.
Although Tesla is moving forward with plans to ramp up vehicle production over the next few years, the company has also placed a greater emphasis on its powertrain business, which services other car manufacturers. Last month, Tesla disclosed it had a $60 million contract to supply parts to  Toyota for the production of the upcoming electric RAV4.
Clunky battery parts may seem relatively boring when compared to Tesla’s sleek roadsters, but it may be the key to finding their (so far elusive) path to stable profitability.

904,AU Optronics Unveils A Solar Touch Keyboard,https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/03/au-optronics-unveils-a-solar-touch-keyboard/,2010/11/03,"Move aside Logitech, there’s another solar keyboard in town.
Earlier this week, Logitech introduced the K750, an $80 wireless, solar-powered keyboard made of recyclable plastic and billed as the world’s first solar keyboard. The K750 may be first but it certainly won’t be the last.
This Wednesday, Taiwan’s AU Optronics released details on its own solar keyboard solution. According to reports, AUO’s version is essentially a solar sheet, measuring 2.1 millimeters thick with touch sensitivity. Aesthetically, it looks like the complete fusion of a solar panel and keyboard. The surface is perfectly smooth and somewhat reflective, like a solar panel, with only the hint of a keyboard’s outline.
Similar to Logitech’s K750, the AUO version promises to charge in natural and artificial light. However, unlike Logitech’s freestanding model, AUO’s 14-inch touch keyboard will be built into computer manufacturers’ laptop sets.
AUO will showcase demo models of its solar contraption next week during FPD International in Chiba, Japan.

905,"For The First Time, EPA Fuel Economy Guide Rates SUVs And Vans",https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/03/for-the-first-time-epa-fuel-economy-guide-rates-suvs-and-vans/,2010/11/03," The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Energy (DOE) today released the official 2011 Fuel Economy Guide, providing information about estimated mileage and fuel costs for model year 2011 vehicles sold in the U.S.
For the first time, the annual Fuel Economy Guide includes medium-duty passenger vehicles, generally large sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and passenger vans. These were not previously subject to fuel economy measurement and labeling requirements.
Listings in the 2011 Fuel Economy Guide provide an estimated annual fuel cost based on a vehicle’s MPG rating and national estimates for annual mileage and gas prices. The online version lets users input local gas prices and information about their normal driving habits to get a personalized fuel cost estimate.
The EPA and DOE will provide additional automobile fuel economy information online as more 2011 models, including electric cars— like the Chevy Volt, the Nissan Leaf— and plug-in electric hybrids become available.
The guide arrives as the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group including General Motors, Ford, Chrysler and nine others, has accused the EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of setting unattainable goals for vehicles’ fuel efficiency by the year 2025.
The Detroit News reports:

“The NHTSA and EPA said they could propose anywhere from 47 mpg to 62 miles per gallon (MPG) by 2025, achieved by a range of 3 to 6 percent increases annually.
The agencies said the added costs per vehicle would range from $770 to $3,500 by 2025. The move could add $12 billion to $50 billion annually to the price of new cars.
But the automakers said the actual price could be 2 1/2 times higher, based on a National Research Council report. They said under some scenarios, consumers wouldn’t recoup the higher vehicle costs through fuel savings.”

In late October, the EPA and U.S. Department of Transportation released the first national standards to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from and improve fuel efficiency of heavy-duty vehicles including combination tractors, heavy-duty pickups and vans, and vocational vehicles (such as delivery trucks, dump trucks and buses).
Environmentalists and auto industry officials told Politico.com that they expect “conflict with the administration as government control of GM and Chrysler diminishes, especially when Republicans take over the House next year.”
On Tuesday, the Obama administration announced plans to reduce the government’s 61% stake in General Motors to 35% in the next few years, starting with a $10 billion stock offering Nov. 18th. The offering marks the probable end of an era when the U.S. government and auto industry collaborated extensively to save more than an estimated 1 million domestic auto-industry jobs.
With respect to the EPA, the President said in a post-election news conference on Wednesday:
“The EPA is under a court order that says [greenhouse gases] are a pollutant that fall under their jurisdiction…We need to not ignore the science [but] find ways to solve [environmental] problems in ways that don’t hurt the economy, that encourage the development of clean energy in this country, and give us the opportunity to create jobs [while] putting us in a competitive posture around the world.”

906,"Voters Weigh Suspension Of Air Pollution Law, As California Reveals Cap-And-Trade Plans",https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/02/california-co2-law-midterm-election/,2010/11/02," Just ahead of today’s midterm election, California regulators established a preliminary model for a greenhouse gas cap-and-trade system. The system is intended to help the state control industrial greenhouse gas emissions in aggregate in adherence with its progressive, controversial AB32 air pollution law which legislature passed there in 2006.
Currently, California requires reporting by (and third-party verification of) facilities and companies that emit 25,000 tons of greenhouse gases or more each year. Originally, AB32 laid out plans to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from industrial sectors and electricity by 25% by the year 2020 restoring them to 1990 levels.
Fuel suppliers would come under the air emissions “cap” in 2015. The program would begin to take effect in 2012, with the California Air Resources Board (ARB) monitoring and enforcing the law.
The midterm election results in California will determine if AB32 remains on course. Proposition 23on the state’s ballot would suspend the air pollution control law until unemployment in the state drops to 5.5% or less for a full year.
Many cleantech entrepreneurs and institutional investors want AB32 to proceed, as its enforcement could accelerate the uptake of their companies’ services and products, and help the country maintain a leadership role in the global, cleantech market.
Environmentalists believe that AB32 could help the state and its residents potentially save as much as they spend to achieve better air quality and energy efficiency; and that it would create green jobs for the region. California is working with other Western states and Canada to devise a wider, regional cap-and-trade system.
Meanwhile, Proposition 23 supporters— who seek to suspend AB32— believe that enforcing the strict air pollution controls now will reduce California’s gross state product enough to choke billions of dollars out of the state each year, perpetuating high unemployment; that the air pollution law would cause an increase in the cost of public services, especially transportation; and that there are better ways for California to combat environmental problems.
The cap-and-trade system’s preliminary design allows companies that operate well within the state’s emissions limits to opt-in, initiate reporting and begin selling their offsets to polluters. A full banking and trading system, it would also allow companies to make up for some of their carbon emissions through programs like planting trees, or destroying ozone depleting substances.
A sample scenario: a company that emits 100 tons of greenhouse gases in a year, once the controls are in place, would be allowed to emit 90 a year by the state, but would make up for the rest by reducing two to ten tons through improved operations, and up to eight tons through other programs outside of the cap.
The following gases are covered by California’s law and system: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), and other fluorinated greenhouse gases.
Some industries will have to adapt more quickly and others will be given a bit more leeway should AB32 escape suspension.  A Scientific American feature story on the trading system yesterday explained:

The system will cover 85% of the state’s industrial emissions by the time it ends in 2020. At the outset of trading, in 2012, industrial sources and electricity generators and suppliers responsible for more than 25,000 tons of CO2 per year will be covered; in 2015, it will expand to cover transportation fuels and fuels combusted at industrial, residential and commercial buildings that are not otherwise covered directly. The cap is being set at business-as-usual levels for 2012 and will decline linearly after that, except to include transportation fuels in 2015 at their anticipated business-as-usual level…
Oil and gas extraction and paper, glass, cement, lime, iron and steel manufacturing are among the industries that California has decided to protect the most by giving them 100 percent of their allowances through 2020. Food producers, sawmills, breweries and pesticide and clothing manufacturers are among those in the second tier, receiving 100 percent at the outset but ratcheting down to 50 percent by 2018. Medicine and aircraft makers are in the bottom category, with 30 percent of their emissions burden covered by the end…

907,"Moving Beyond Electric Motorcycles, Mission Motors Becomes EV Tech Supplier",https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/02/moving-beyond-electric-motorcycles-mission-motors-becomes-ev-tech-supplier/,2010/11/02,"San Francisco-based Mission Motors has gained some recognition in the Valley for its flagship electric motorcycle, the Mission One Superbike. The sleek vehicle, which features a lithium ion battery park, can reach speeds of 150 mph and go for 150 miles on a single charge. The problem is, it’s not quite ready for prime time.
Despite earlier promises for a Q4 2010 release and then a Q2 2011 release, production has been marred by delays and there is now no clear visibility on a delivery date for consumers. Given the recent setbacks, Mission Motors is wisely diversifying its business beyond the Mission One.
On Tuesday, the startup unveiled a new unit: Mission Electric Vehicle Technology, or MissionEVT. MissionEVT will suppy vehicle manufacturers (from motorcycles to cars to trucks) with electric vehicle technology, including “energy storage systems, drive systems and software intelligence,” the company said in a statement. In addition, MissionEVT will also offer integration services for their clients, such as electric drive expertise and test facilities.
“Our company will be able to expand into new markets, bringing the advances we have made in EV technology to multiple vehicle platforms and manufacturers,” CEO Jit Bhattacharya said in a statement. “This creates a tremendous high-volume opportunity for Mission’s powertrain technology, while solving a critical need for vehicle manufacturers trying to keep pace with the rapid electrification of vehicles.”
The powertrain technology offered by MissionEVT is based on the research and development for Mission One. According to Bhattacharya, this development process yielded several core building blocks— in areas like battery storage and software— which can now be molded applied to other vehicle types.

908,South Korea Pledges $8.2 Billion For Offshore Wind Farms,https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/01/south-korea-pledges-8-2-billion-for-offshore-wind-farms/,2010/11/01,"VC funding for cleantech startups tumbled in the third quarter, last week Vestas announced plans to layoff 3,000 employees, and on Wednesday, First Wind shelved IPO plans amid weak demand— the wind energy sector is certainly facing its share of headwinds but there are still signs of life.
On Tuesday, the South Korean government announced that it will invest 9.2 trillion won, or $8.2 billion, through 2019 to build offshore wind farms. According to reports, the goal is to have 500 wind turbines along the country’s west coast in the Yellow Sea with a capacity of 2500 megawatt hours.
The announcement seems to be a scaled down version of the government’s initial plans. In September, the Yonhap news agency said officials from the Ministry of Knowledge Economy were hoping to spend roughly 9 trillion won to install 1,000 wind turbines. As it turns out, the won doesn’t stretch as far in this capital intensive industry.
Although, the South Korean government may be more realistic these days, the country is not shying away from big investments in the larger cleantech space. If anything, South Korea seems to be picking up the pace. Just last month, the government announced a plan to work with the private sector to invest 40 million won in the renewable energy industry by 2015, with the government  contributing 7 million won and the private sector committing 33 million won. According to the Ministry of Knowledge Economy’s figures, South Korea’s clean energy exports are expected to exceed $36 billion by 2015.

909,The Chevy Volt: An Electric Car With Its Own IP Address,https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/01/the-chevy-volt-electric-gm-ib/,2010/11/01,"CrunchGear’s Matt Burns recently called the Chevy Volt GM’s “knight in shining chrome and white plastic.” Burns was not citing projected sales numbers, instead he was making the point that the Volt has saved GM by forcing the troubled automaker to “change internally and reinvent nearly ever aspect of how it does business.”
In support of Burns’ thesis, IBM and GM revealed new details on Monday on the car’s electronic backbone and how it came together in 29 months, from concept to finish.
Although the Volt is far from the first car with computer functionality, it is a major technological step forward for GM. According to IBM, the Volt is equipped with 100 electronic controllers, its very own IP address and roughly 10 million lines of software code.  That’s far more than its peers and, according to Robert LeBlanc, SVP of IBM’s Middleware Software, that’s also more than today’s Boeing 787 Dreamliner which features a paltry 8 million lines of code.
“Think of it as a data center and computer on wheels,” LeBlanc says.
Given the Volt’s reliance on its software and electronic components, it’s no wonder that GM relied heavily on IBM’s software to put all the pieces together.
As explained in Monday’s press release, GM used IBM’s suite of Rational software products (which includes design and simulation tools) “to develop some of the Volt’s critical electronic controls for the vehicle’s innovative battery system, electric drive unit, and cabin electronics.” According to LeBlanc, IBM’s software allowed disparate engineering teams to collaborate, put products to the test and it helped them model and better understand how various electronic systems would interact.
That’s a significant departure from the past, when GM’s engineering teams would develop components independently, with minimal sharing during the development process.
Forging ahead, the GM/IBM partnership for the Volt is expected to be a template for the development of new GM cars: “We hope to extend the Rational platform to other vehicle lines. Cars are only going to be more complex, every automaker will have to deal with that higher level of complexity and interaction.”
Here’s GM’s promotional video on the Volt’s computer system and its relationship with IBM.

910,"In The Fight Against IT Waste, 1E Releases NightWatchman 6.0",https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/01/in-the-fight-against-it-waste-1e-releases-nightwatchman-6-0/,2010/11/01,"Computer power management software company, 1E has released a new version of its marquee product, NightWatchman.
Like its predecessors, version 6.0, helps corporations manage their network of computers to optimize energy efficiency. It gives IT managers the ability to remotely power down computers and establish energy-saving settings (ie. automatic shutdown of desktops during the weekend).
In the latest version, 1E has added three key features: a new web-based dashboard (to help managers oversee the entire company’s computer power usage), improved diagnostic tools to determine why a computer hasn’t properly powered down, and tariff calculations based on location.
Given how the price of energy can fluctuate significantly on a region by region basis, the new location-based calculations will help companies more accurately assess how much they’re saving on energy usage. Energy efficiency as it relates to IT management is becoming an increasingly important field, and according to Gartner Research, in two years more than half of mid and large-sized businesses will centrally manage their desktops’ energy consumption.
Although the average NightWatchman PC only saves $36 a year in energy costs, those incremental savings yield significant sums in aggregate. Several of 1E’s clients are large corporations with massive IT operations, such as AT&T, Ford and Dell. According to 1E, NightWatchman has 4.6 million licensed users around the world, a group that has collectively saved $530 million in energy costs.

911,"US Venture Investments In Cleantech Plummet In Q3, Energy Efficiency Bucks The Trend",https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/01/us-cleantech-investments-q3-2010/,2010/11/01," Domestic venture capital funding of cleantech businesses fell 55% to $575.6 million in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the same period last year according to a new report from Ernst & Young and Dow Jones VentureSource. The energy efficiency segment, however, beat the downward trend.
The largest deal of the entire quarter was a $65 million third-round later stage deal closed by Solaria Corp., a Fremont, CA developer of silicon photovoltaics and high-efficiency solar panels.
Including “energy efficiency products, power and efficiency management services or industrial products,” the energy efficiency segment saw 17 deals raising a total of $161.7 million in venture capital funds, representing an increase of 6% by dollars, and 21% by number of deals, year-over-year in Q3.
Smooth-Stone— an Austin, Texas startup that sells ultra-lower power chip technology to data centers— closed the largest energy efficiency deal for the quarter. Graduating from the Austin Technology Incubator, the company raised $48 million from a syndicate of investors including: Battery Ventures, Flybridge Capital Partners, Highland Capital Partners, ARM, Advanced Technology Investment Company (ATIC) and Texas Instruments.
Corporate investments and plans to invest in energy efficiency influenced the trend, the Ernst & Young / Dow Jones report suggests. For example, General Electric (GE) said it would invest $432 million over the next four years into research, design, and manufacture of energy-efficient refrigerators in the US.
Overall, corporate investor participation increased from 15% of deals in Q3 last year to about 23% for the same quarter this year. Cleantech deals in Q3 2010 included participation by corporate investors: BASF Venture Capital GmbH, Intel Capital and GM Ventures, which all did two deals apiece.
Beyond energy efficiency, other segments faced a challenging quarter. Venture capital funds going to industrial products and services— which include agriculture, construction, transportation, materials, and general consumer products—  fell 72% to $116.9 million, representing a 50% drop in financing rounds to 12. The alternative fuels segment raised $50.5 million in three deals.
Regionally, the report found California’s venture investments in cleantech falling 44% to 21 deal, and by dollar value, falling 71% to $295 million. In comparison, California had five deals over $50 million one year ago, including the $286 million financing of Solyndra.
Massachusetts followed California as largest regional overall investors, with eight deals worth $87.6 million, representing a 50% increase in deals and a 65% increase in capital invested compared to the same time last year.

912,"Is Gulf Seafood Safe To Eat? Feds' New Test Says Yes, Not Convincingly",https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/29/is-gulf-seafood-safe-to-eat-feds-new-test-says-yes-not-convincingly/,2010/10/29," More than 9,000 square miles of U.S. federal Gulf waters are closed to commercial and recreational fishing today thanks to the BP oil spill. However, government offices today claimed that seafood from the Gulf is basically safe to consume, based on the results from their latest battery of tests.
You gonna eat that? Companies responsible for the environmental disaster spilled about 5 million [Correction: in the original post, I wrote “gallons” and have corrected the typo] barrels of oil, accidentally. They poured about 2 million gallons of oil dispersants into the Gulf waters on purpose, though. The dispersants were supposed to break up the wildlife-choking slicks into droplets that could be more easily digested by oil-eating bacteria. Or at least, they’d make the water look more like water and less like tar while the cameras were flying overhead.
At the time of the spill, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) sent scientists to the Gulf to help with the oil spill cleanup. Even that federal office knew nothing about the dispersants’ likely impact on sea life or humans. USGS director Maria McNutt admitted to her office’s ignorance at last week’s 2010 PopTech conference.
By May, the St. Petersburg Times reported, there were still no federal standards for how much dispersant could be present in seafood consumed by humans, a detail the paper confirmed with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
Here’s what the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) claimed in their joint press statement today regarding the safety of seafood in the Gulf, though:


Building upon the extensive testing and protocols already in use by federal, state and local officials for the fishing waters of the Gulf, NOAA and FDA have developed and are using a chemical test to detect dispersants used in the Deepwater Horizon-BP oil spill in fish, oysters, crab and shrimp….
Experts trained in a rigorous sensory analysis process have been testing Gulf seafood for the presence of contaminants, and every seafood sample from reopened waters has passed sensory testing for contamination with oil and dispersant.  Nonetheless, to ensure consumers have total confidence in the [emphasis added] safety of seafood being harvested from the Gulf, NOAA and FDA have added [a] second test for dispersant when considering reopening Gulf waters to fishing.
Using this new, second test, in the Gulf scientists have tested 1,735 tissue samples including more than half of those collected to reopen Gulf of Mexico federal waters.  Only a few showed trace amounts of dispersants residue (13 of the 1,735) and they were well below the safety threshold of 100 parts per million for finfish and 500 parts per million for shrimp, crabs and oysters. As such, they do not pose a threat to human health.


The press statement follows an investigative report by English Al Jazeera about the dispersants’ impact on people and our environment that concluded:


The Gulf has suffered the largest accidental marine oil spill in history. Compounding the problem, BP has admitted to using at least 1.9 million gallons of widely banned toxic dispersants… Dispersed, weathered oil continues to flow ashore daily…
[Human] health impacts include headaches, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pains, chest pains, respiratory system damage, skin sensitization, hypertension, central nervous system depression, neurotoxic effects, genetic mutations, cardiac arrhythmia, and cardiovascular damage…

One researcher studying the impact of dispersants in the Gulf, told Al Jazeera about dolphins— and people— hemorrhaging from too much dispersant exposure. Gulf residents showed off pieces of their boats that had been eaten away by dispersant-contaminated waters over just a short time.
How could the new FDA-NOAA tests declare the seafood from the Gulf oil spill waters safe to eat in light of Al Jazeera’s (and so many others’) reports?
[UPDATE: Readers requested clarification on “others’ reports.”] News organizations from MotherJones to the Washington Post and New York Times have run stories that examine the issue of dispersants’ toxicity in a similar light.
According to the press statement, the government labs tested for traces of dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate, a.k.a. DOSS, a component of the dispersants used in the Gulf that’s approved by the FDA for use in various household products and over-the-counter medication at low levels.
They didn’t test for the other stuff that’s included in Corexit 9500 the primary dispersant used by BP and still sprayed over the Gulf these days. [Update: further detail on ingredients in disperants.] The labs also didn’t test the toxicity of oil-and-dispersant combined.
Corexit 9500 includes ingredients like propanols that are used in household cleaners (which one presumably shouldn’t eat) but it is less toxic than some other Corexit dispersants, which include the ingredient 2-butoxyethanol. These other Corexit dispersants were likely used in the immediate response to the oil spill.
BP and Nalco— the company that makes Corexit— for some reason, haven’t revealed the exact ingredients of what they used, how much of it, and when in the Gulf waters. Nalco sticks to the message that it has only been “making” Corexit 9500 for Gulf responders since the start of the spill.

913,"Smith Electric's CEO On Delivering Zero Emission Trucks, Avoiding The G-Word",https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/29/qa-ceo-smith-electric-vehicles/,2010/10/29," Bryan Hansel, chief executive of Smith Electric Vehicles U.S., headquartered in Kansas City, Mo., almost disdains the word “green.” His company makes all-electric trucks for medium-duty commercial and industrial use. They compete against brands like Ford, Peterbilt and Hino.
Smith’s EV technology is also constantly compared to traditional diesel, gas and alternative fuel combustion engines. Hansel believes his trucks have to dominate based on performance and cost savings in light of this. Even the company’s logo is orange not green.
The CEO emphasizes the relative price predictability of electricity over liquid fuels instead of strictly environmental benefits. In 2008— the year Hansel joined Smith Electric—  the transportation sector used 13.88 million barrels of liquid fuels per day, and the industrial sector used 4.75 million in the United States according to the Energy Information Administration of the U.S. Department of Energy. Liquid fuel demand is expected to increase, with those sectors using 14.27 million and 4.82 million barrels of liquid fuel per day by 2015.
The cost of liquid fuels (primarily petroleum-based) fluctuates more dramatically than electricity’s. The prices are impacted by crude oil production, world oil pricing, taxes, and advances in fuel technology. Meanwhile, electricity can be generated from renewable sources, on or off the grid (like a rooftop solar array) and purchased from a utility at a price that’s locked in over the long-term.
For every gallon of gasoline used, according to the U.S. EPA 2,421 grams of carbon dioxide (CO2) are emitted into the atmosphere, and 2,778 grams per gallon of diesel. The greenhouse gas emissions could also be taxed in the future.
Hansel’s cost savings message resonated with some major corporations, including Staples, Frito-Lay and Coca Cola. Currently, The Smith Newton is the only all electric, medium-to-heavy truck offering on the GSA schedule, which means soon Smith Electric may count the U.S. military a large customer.
Hansel spoke with TechCrunch this week about how Smith is convincing American fleet managers to try electric trucks, and some of the challenges the company faces as it scales to meet the demand. (Interview after the photo.)

Smith Electric Vehicles was founded in 1920 in the UK. How and why did you join the company?

I never thought about designing vehicles, or woke up and said ‘I’ll be the electric truck guy,’ but I had been around mechanical engineering and manufacturing my entire life. I ran a product development company for more than 15 years where we helped bring products to market for Fortune 500 companies— that was Virdev.
This particular opportunity came about for me when a friend of mine acquired Smith [in the UK] and had brought its technology and business to the strong state that it is in today. He said, ‘hey, you need this technology that I’ve got [in the United States].’ He knew that I understood what it takes to scale product, drive costs out, and that this was in my fiber.
It really happened this quickly. On a Friday, I sold a business making medical devices in October 2008. By Monday, I was thinking about bringing electric trucks to North America. I had closed a deal to license the technology by January of 2009.

How do you deal with “haters,” people who don’t believe electric vehicles will ever be on par with combustion engine vehicles, or worth the investment?

Personally, I don’t run into these people. That’s because I’m not in a consumer environment. I’m not telling anyone ‘Here’s an electric vehicle that’s going to replace the sports car or family sedan you’re so emotionally attached to already.’ In the business to business environment that we focus on, people make logical financial and operational decisions.
We talk to customers about the ten-year total life cost of their fleets and individual vehicles. We ask them, ‘Can you predict diesel fuel costs for ten years? How would you like to do that versus buying electricity at a more predictable level?’ If they buy a new diesel truck today— Smith Electric vehicles end up being 80% cheaper on a per mile basis from fuel savings.
Over ten years, for total life cost, if you’re driving about a 50-mile route every day, and coming back to the place to recharge overnight, at a central depot, then they’re at  least 50% cheaper.

What about your business keeps you up at night? 

I’ve been overwhelmed by corporations saying ‘We’re ready to go, we’ll take thousands of vehicles! Can you build em?’ There’s nobody ready to supply those parts. People are telling them the battery supplies and motors are just around the corner. It’s not quite that easy.
We have to sell our suppliers on the fact that we have orders. We work with one company that was a supplier to the EV-1! They have hung around and maintained in the industry this long, and they’ve heard every story. One company in the industry said it would build 200,000 hybrid-electric vehicles. They only made 25,000. So suppliers have reason to be cautious, I understand.
We have to do everything we say we’ll do to win them over. And we have to trust them. What has kept me up is trying to give them disclosures. Should we put them in touch with our customers, directly? We’ve done so with Frito-Lay, Coca Cola and Staples. We’ve had our clients and suppliers— and some of them regard each other as competitors— in the same room, talking about their various challenges of adoption.

How many Smith Electric Vehicles are operating in the U.S. already?
There are more than a hundred out there already. Hundreds more will be on the road domestically by early next year. We also have a Department of Energy grant to deliver 510 vehicles that will ship before the middle of next year. We’re certainly ramping up production. The vehicles each have on-board data collection. We’re real time downloading data to understand how they’re being deployed, how they’re working and what’s optimal for our customers.
Who have been your most important customers to date and why?

They’ve all been pioneering and important strategic launch partners. We actually said no to potential clients, at times. When you are a company that’s new to the U.S., it’s hard to say ‘We’re not selling to you yet. At this time, we’re only selling to launch partners.’
A focused strategy has worked for us, and created a level of demand that’s unprecedented in the sector here. It was a magic bullet. Prospective clients wanted us to electrify other things, or sell quantities we wouldn’t sell. A more focused strategy helped us maintain a higher quality overall.
Our largest order came from Frito-Lay. I have to give them credit for being visionaries. They have dedicated staff, engineering and fleet managers to bring their electric vehicles program online, and make electrification work in their business.

Your trucks can’t plug into the wall, or recharge at EV stations that are becoming more pervasive in the U.S.— would you ever go into building EV charging stations for trucks?

We have a three-phase, 60 amp service requirement, and all the charging technology is built into our trucks. Today, it’s true that there is no commercially available charger for our trucks. EV charging station companies [like Coulomb or ClipperCreek] don’t have a product available for us yet.
If they do bring something to market, that would help push our customers in that direction. Right now, customers have a central depot or warehouse setup. The trucks go back and charge at the same place when they’re not in use. While commercial availability of EV charging stations is part of the evolution of our business, we’ll never build charge points. It’s not part of our service offering.

914,Siemens Wins $466 Million Contract To Build 70 Green Trains,https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/29/siemens-wins-466-million-contract-to-build-70-green-trains/,2010/10/29,"Siemens has snapped up a $466 million six-year contract to build 70 electric trains for Amtrak.
The deal, which is Siemens’ first major contract with the rail operator, is a significant coup for the company which is trying to aggressively expand its footprint in America.
Although Siemens has dominated in the light rail category in the US— with one out of every three light rail vehicles made by Siemens— the company is eager to lock up new deals, especially those outside of urban zones. In particular, Siemens is trying to become a major player in the high-speed rail market, which should accelerate in the coming years thanks to federal dollars.
Under the Amtrak deal, Siemens will add 200 jobs at its light rail manufacturing plant in Sacramento, California and 50 jobs at plants in Georgia, which will build motors and propulsion containers for the trains. Although the manufacturing process isn’t completely green, the Sacramento plant uses solar energy for up to 80% of its power, according to Siemens’ press release. The first trains will hit the track in 2013.
The new trains, called Amtrack Cities Sprinters, will be a step up from the average locomotives on the market and will feature a few green highlights to improve energy efficiency. Modeled after the European version, the EuroSprinter, these trains be able to easily maintain speeds of 125 mph. Amtrak plans to use them on the Northeast Corridor, a line that connects DC to Boston, and the Keystone Corridor (from Philadelphia to Harrisburg).
“This isn’t your grandfather’s locomotive,” Oliver Hauck, president of  Siemens Industry’s Mobility Division, said in a statement.  “Not only will we use renewable energy to build them, the locomotives will also include energy efficient features, such as regenerative braking that can feed up to 100 percent of the energy generated during braking back to the power grid.”
A feature which will also reduce wear on the breaks. More efficient breaks will not reinvent the green wheel of the industry, but it’s certainly an incremental gain.

915,"Vermont Energy Co. Raises $260,000 For Sustainable Gas-And-Convenience Stores",https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/28/vtenergyco-sustainable-gas-and-convenience-store/,2010/10/28," The Vermont Energy Company attracted a $260,000 seed investment a new SEC filing revealed to grow their environmental-minded gas station and convenience store business.
Currently, the company operates a flagship store and four-pump gas station in Burlington, Vermont. According to a company spokesperson, they hope to become a leading supplier of alternative fuels over time, and stock their shelves with sustainable items alongside select, traditional packaged goods.
The concept is simple— offer a sustainable alternative to 7-eleven or Mobil and other leading gas station and coveninece stores. The gas and convenience store industry in the U.S. is highly fragmented, but according to Hoovers research, reaches $200 billion in annual sales mainly selling gasoline.
The Vermont Energy Company, if it takes off massively, could become the go-to, roadside brand for drivers seeking grease diesel, or other advanced and clean fuels.
[UPDATE:] A co-founder of the Vermont Energy Company, Kevin Hartley, previously founded and sold a renewable energy startup, Green Mountain Energy, to BP in 2000. That business, he said, was the fastest to go from $0 to $100 million in revenue in the state of Vermont.
His co-founder and brother John Hartley, he says, is doing the operational work, and heavy lifting with their alternative convenience store and gas station business, while he stays focused on his day job as head of strategy at the Nasdaq-traded, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters. A leader in the specialty coffee industry, GMCR uses alternative energy in its operations. In 2009, for example, the company installed a solar rooftop array at their headquarters office in Waterbury, Vermont.
The Vermont Energy Company currently offers drivers of fuel-efficient cars a discount on plain old gasoline. Run under the name The Good Carma program, the discount is based on the miles-per-gallon ratings of customers’ vehciles. Such programs, if they became available nationally, could help encourage consumers to upgrade their rides to more fuel-efficient, if not zero emissions, electric vehicles.
Hartley describes the idea of Good Carma as the opposite of a volume discount. “Usually in a free market economy, the more you use, the lower the price. We’re not doing that usual thing. Our brand will reward efficiency with a lower price at the pump, and give a healthy, organic option for every item in the store. But the stores will be all about giving customers a choice.”
The Hartleys are also planning to donate 20% of their profits to renewable energy and efficiency causes down the line.

916,"First Wind Retreats, Shelves IPO Plans",https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/28/first-wind-retreats-shelves-ipo-plans/,2010/10/28,"Facing a dubious IPO and downward pricing pressure, First Wind announced on Thursday that it will put its plans to go public on hold.
The wind energy company, which first signaled its intention to go public way back in 2008, was expected to IPO this week but several analysts and media reports questioned investor demand, citing a heavy debt load, a lack of profitability and broader challenges in the sector.
Amid growing concern, the company dropped its pricing forecast to $18 to $20 on Wednesday— a 25% cut from its previous range of $24 to $26. Now, after shaving its expectations, First Wind is pressing pause on the entire IPO and has not indicated when it will resume plans to go public.
“The terms that the IPO market was seeking at this time were not attractive to the company,” the company’s CEO Paul Gaynor said in a statement, according to reports.
The cleantech IPO market has been pretty choppy this year, especially for companies that are seen as heavily dependent on government subsidies. On Thursday, Enel, a major European utility company, lowered its price range for  the upcoming IPO of its green unit (Enel Green Power) in a bid to attract larger, institutional investors. The new range is now at €1.60 to €2.10 euros from €1.80 to €2.20. This is Enel’s second price drop.
First Wind, which owns and operates wind farms in the U.S., was hoping to raise cash in the IPO to ease its large debt load. As outlined in a recent S-1 filing, the company still has $582.2 million in outstanding debt. Moreover, since its inception the company has racked up $233.0 million in losses. Cognizant of its debt and ongoing losses, the company warned investors that “our substantial indebtedness [could] make it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and failure to comply with these obligations could result in an event of default under those agreements, which could be difficult to cure, or result in our bankruptcy.”

917,SolFocus Selling Solar To Saudi Arabia,https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/27/solfocus-sells-solar-to-saudis/,2010/10/27," Americans exporting renewable energy resources to the Middle East? It’s not opposite day.
A Mountainview, Calif. company, SolFocus, announced a deal with a major construction company in Saudi Arabia— Advanced Vision Electro Mechanical Company (a.k.a. Vision) — that is building a new, commercial solar power plant in Bahra.
The plant will be the first in Saudi Arabia to use concentrator photovoltaic solar power systems, or CPVs according to a joint press release from SolFocus and Vision. In general, CPV systems consist of solar cells and optics that concentrate sunlight onto the cells increasing their power output and, in the end, decreasing the cost of solar-generated electricity in sunny, dry environments.
SolFocus sells warranty-backed, concentrator photovoltaic solar systems that it manufactures primarily in Mesa, Arizona. To date, SolFocus has raised $143 million in venture funding.
The new solar power plant in Bahra employing SolFocus technology will deliver around 300 megawatt hours of solar energy per year, representing a 132 kilowatt nameplate capacity.
Saudi Arabia is the world’s largest producer and exporter of total petroleum liquids according to theU.S. Energy Information Administration.
At the 2009 United Nations’ Summit on Climate Change, Saudi Arabia’s negotiator Mohammed Al-Sabban expressed disbelief that global warming is caused or accelerated by humans, and was concerned about the likely economic impact to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) if others reduce their use of oil.
Still viewed as an obstructionist by global sustainability advocates, Saudi Arabia began investing in renewable energy recently. Why would the OPEC leader warm up to solar? First, the region gets a lot of sun.
Co-founder and chief of technology at SolFocus, Steve Horne, also explained on Wednesday:
“The Saudi king has recognized climate change, and wants to reduce the carbon footprint of the country. A significant percentage of the oil that’s extracted from Saudi Arabia is used internally. That’s what they’ll be able to offset by using renewable energy. The king is interested in exporting renewable energy as well. There is a process of putting together a transmission line that runs up the east coast towards Kuwait, now. The king has a long-term vision for the country as a generator of renewable energy.”

Mark Crowley, chief executive officer of SolFocus said in a press statement:
“The high sun conditions of the Middle East provide an ideal environment for reaping large-scale, low-cost solar energy from CPV systems. Together [we] will bring the world’s most efficient and resource-friendly solar technology to Saudi Arabia, providing energy diversification for the country.”

The project developers, Vision, will also build and install additional solar power plants within the research centers at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) and throughout Saudi Arabia.
Hassan Chahine, general manager at Vision said in a press statement: “This is a breakthrough in Saudi Arabia’s thrust for energy diversification. We believe the Bahra plant will serve as a model for the further research and study of clean water and power solutions that diversify the region’s energy mix.”

918,"Don't Tell Tesla: In 2020, Sales Of Electric Vehicles Will Be Less Than 8% Of The Global Market",https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/27/electric-vehicles-jdpower-tesla/,2010/10/27,"Given all the apparent excitement surrounding electric vehicles and the billions invested by automakers, financial firms and government incentives, you would  assume there was a groundswell of consumer support for hybrid and battery electric cars underlying this momentum.
Unfortunately, according to a J.D. Power and Associates report released this morning, we may be on the electric car bandwagon but once you get us to the dealership, we look the other way.
The firm predicts that in 2020, international sales of hybrid and battery electric cars will total 5.2 million, or 7.3%, of the 70-plus million consumer vehicles expected to be sold. This year, the world is on track to sell 954,500 electric units, 2.2% of all car sales. Thus, in a decade, consumers will only move the needle about 5 percentage points, from 2.2 to 7.3. If the future of the car is electric, it’s not happening in the next decade and— given the sluggish growth curve— not the one after that either.
So why the apprehensiveness among consumers?
According to J.D. Power and Associates, a confluence of factors have discouraged would-be-electric owners. Not surprisingly, the number one reason is money. Although there are government subsidies to encourage green car purchases in the US, it’s still difficult for cash-strapped buyers not to compare the new hybrid models against cheaper, less fuel efficient vehicles (remember, the recession is not over for the 9-plus percent who are still unemployed or the many who are underemployed).
“Many consumers say they are concerned about the environment, but when they find out how much a green vehicle is going to cost, their altruistic inclination declines considerably,” John Humphrey, an SVP at J.D. Power, said in a statement. “For example, among consumers in the U.S. who initially say they are interested in buying a hybrid vehicle, the number declines by some 50 percent when they learn of the extra $5,000, on average, it would cost to acquire the vehicle.”

Beyond sticker shock, the report says other popular reasons included: aesthetics, insecurity in the new technology, unhappiness with how the car performed, and the need to recharge batteries/driving range.
Who is actually buying?
J.D. Power says from their research, a very clear, dominant demographic emerged:  “buyers of HEVs and BEVs are generally older, more highly educated (possessing a postgraduate degree), high-income individuals who have a deep interest in technology, or who like to be among the early adopters of any new technology product.”
At least there’s hope for those Tesla dealerships in Silicon Valley.

This week, AT&T unleashed the Eco-App, a youth-centric iPhone app that tries to promote sustainability through education. It’s hard to argue with a such a legitimate, noble goal but the app itself is a bit of a head scratcher.
As explained on AT&T’s website, the Eco-App has two top features: a tool to help teens find nearby recycling centers and educational resources to help teens comprehend the “environmental benefits of paperless billing.”
File this under the increasingly expanding folder of “What was AT&T Thinking?”
Eco-app is part of AT&T’s “One Million Eco Challenge,” a broader initiative to raise environmental awareness among kids and teens. To be fair, the app includes useful information, like tips about local environmental events but it just seems awkwardly out of touch, like the cliche reindeer sweaters grandmothers push on unsuspecting teens.  I have full faith that a large fraction of America’s youth is interested in environmental issues, we’ll just have to find a better way to reach out to them— beyond paperless billing.

920,Solar Millennium Gets The Greenlight To Build The World's Largest Solar Project In California,https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/26/solar-millenium-gets-the-green-light-to-build-the-worlds-largest-solar-project-in-california/,2010/10/26,"The US solar market took another step forward this week with the federal government’s approval of Solar Millennium’s plan to build a massive thermal power station in Blythe, California. Located between Phoenix and Los Angeles in the arid Palo Verde Valley, this thinly populated city will soon be home to the world’s largest solar project.
The Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management delivered the final greenlight, wrapping up a (relatively swift) year-long approval process. Technically, it is the government’s first approval of a parabolic trough power plant, which uses curved mirrors to direct the sun’s heat towards a pipe that contains a heat transfer fluid. The heat from this fluid helps create steam which ultimately powers a turbine
Solar Millennium, a German firm, plans to build four plants on the expansive property with a total capacity of 1,000 megawatts— which is roughly on par with the country’s current total solar capacity. With 1,000 MW at completion, the station would be able to power more than 300,000 homes.
The hope, the company says, is to start supplying the grid with electricity by 2013. In terms of regional economic impact, Solar Millennium predicts that the project will  hire 1,000 people during the construction phase and 220 permanent workers (once its operational).
In the meantime, there’s quite a bit of construction to be done which will require significant financing.  In a press release, the company said it has secured enough cash for the first wave of construction, which could begin as early as this year, but acknowledged that it is heavily dependent on government incentives and pending loans.
Speaking of the federal government’s approval, Solar Millennium’s CFO, Oliver Blamberger says, “This paves the way for the start of construction of the first two 242-MW plants before the end of the year…This is also good news for our advanced talks with the US Department of Energy on the loan guarantees for which we have applied. A successful conclusion of this process would secure more than two thirds of the financing volume of the first two planned power plants through the American Federal Financing Bank.”
As we mentioned in a post on Monday,  the US solar market is ramping up significantly, with capacity expected to grow roughly 30x over the next 10 years to 44G. But the capital intensive industry will need to continue to raise heaps of private capital (and benefit from generous government policies) to get there.

921,Blue Water Satellite’s Data Diving: A Very 21st-Century Industry,https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/25/blue-water-satellites-data-diving-a-very-21st-century-industry/,2010/10/25,"
At first glance, Blue Water Satellite might strike you as a poor fit for a post on this website. We’re so inundated with web-based startups that we forget there is a world out there full of technology startups that are just as new and just as interesting, but have nothing whatever to do with the web. But in addition to being an interesting business in its own right, Blue Water Satellite is an example of the deep data analysis industry which in a way has always been with us, but more recently has been flourishing due to the sheer volume of useful data.
At Disrupt we saw an impressive toolset for social data provided by DataSift. Those guys surely have a rosy future if only because they’re getting in early to the web data-diving game. Similarly, Blue Water Satellite (BWS) has a very specific mission at the moment, but the way they’re branching out, they hope to be a leader in the growing business of satellite and environmental data analysis. Providing a unique and powerful way to visualize or interpret a huge amount of data is turning into quite the business model.
The core concept at BWS is detection of cyanobacteria. It’s a microorganism found all over the world, and which can be dangerous above certain (disputed) concentrations. A pigment found in these creatures, phycocyanin, makes them susceptible to satellite surveillance, but only with the right tools. Traditionally, it’s tested by actual boats dipping into test waters and sending the actual water to an actual lab — a time-consuming process BWS estimates to cost around $300 per data point (that is, per dip), which limits the amount of testing that resource management organizations (think parks departments, the EPA, farmers, industrialists) can or are willing to do. A large lake or series of lakes in a state park might need several launches and a hundred data points several times a year, the costs of which add up for cash-strapped services and nonprofits.
With the aim of improving the entire water monitoring industry (and others), BWS researchers spent two years doing the traditional method, so they could compare it with their own, newer method: by performing a complicated and patented algorithm to raw Landsat imaging data (including, but not exclusive to, visible spectrum), BWS is able to detect cyanobacteria with far greater precision, speed, and range than traditional boat-based methods. It’s a bit like they made a way to Google your lake for the stuff.
It’s also far cheaper: around $0.40 per data point, by their estimate. With that kind of improvement, it seems like only a matter of time before this method is the de facto standard.

I spoke with Milt Baker, Blue Water Satellite’s CEO, about the possibilities and limitations of their business. Coming off reading a number of articles about water scarcity, I asked whether this type of technology was applicable to monitoring municipal watersheds, industrial waste, and so on — things that could be applied internationally to improve the treatment and availability of potable water. Milt said that because the Landsat data is global, and their job is to perform analysis on it, there’s really no geographic limitation to their work. He noted that a lot of governments are under pressure to comply with increasingly stringent water standards, and waste and global warming are causing cyanobacteria and other dangerous elements to spike; the old methods of testing aren’t effective enough.
China, for instance, is approaching a water crisis due to the rapid expansion and ineffective regulation of industrial plants, and chances are they’d see a cost-effective method of outsourcing water testing like this tempting. The scale of the job, too, isn’t an obstacle. He described a job where they had surveyed a 730,000-acre watershed for around 2% of the $500,000 the governing organization had estimated it would cost. That level of savings could be a lifesaver for strapped governments that need to perform due diligence on their water supply, but can’t spare $50 million in yearly operational fees.
The amount of data provided by Landsat (at 16-day increments, going back to the 80s) and in turn, the amount of data BWS can provide to its clients, is formidable. Milt compared this change to the change that occurred when ocean temperature mapping went from ship-based to satellite-based. The amount of information provided, the cost of that information, and the ease of accessibility made for a revolution in environmental science, and Milt hopes something similar will occur with the monitoring of accessible water.
BWS is already capable of detecting phosphorus concentration in land, a useful statistic for agribusiness, and there is R&D going towards detection of animal herds, oil fields, and all the rest of the information hidden in the vasty depths of satellite imagery.
As I said earlier, I find this to be at once a very old and a very new industry. The art of meta-analysis and consulting has been around since the first shamans and chiefs, who used their experience to condense and organize knowledge based on their superior and seasoned understanding. And throughout history it has been incumbent on scholarly authorities to do the kind of obscure analysis that either yields great insights or confirms there were none to be had. Think tanks have lately put powerful minds to work for private money.
Now, the volume and variety of information being produced is so immense that it has become a business model to simply specialize in the extraction of a very specific kind of knowledge from that information. Imagine if Facebook were to make a year’s worth of data on their users available to psychologists, sociologists, and epidemiologists — they would all find different values and trends, all find different ways of making the same set of numbers and characters useful to others.
Raw information is becoming like a natural resource, but one which cannot be depleted, or even reached exactly, but rather must be looked at from different angles, with different lenses. Blue Water Satellite has one very specific lens through which we can view the increasing concentrations of toxic bacteria in our waters due to global warming and other factors. Google might take the same data and put our water sources in context with human infrastructure and cross-correlate population growth, political trends, and traffic data.
Connecting the dots has become a major industry, and the more dots there are, the more there is to connect between them. Hopefully more businesses like BWS will appear and thrive, directed towards increased awareness and knowledge of our planet and social system, and less directed at (as is the current trend) vanity and convenience.
More information can be found at Blue Water Satellite’s website, where you can learn more about cyanobacteria, BWS’s methods, and view a sample report.

922,Ford Earmarks An Additional $850 Million To Build Fuel Efficient Cars,https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/25/ford-earmarks-an-additional-850-million-to-build-more-fuel-efficient-cars/,2010/10/25,"With car sales starting to inch higher and the threat of bankruptcy only faintly visible in the rear-view mirror, Ford is loosening its purse strings once again.
On Monday afternoon, the Dearborn, Michigan based company announced that it will invest another $850 million into the development of more fuel efficient cars and technology.
That cash, which is earmarked for 2011 to 2013, is still contingent on whether the Michigan Economic Development Council approves a robust package of incentives (due for consideration later this week). According to reports— if the package gets the greenlight— Ford will benefit from roughly $400 million in state incentives.
Upon passage, Ford plans to create as many as 1,200 jobs across the state concentrating that growth in several key plants, including Van Dyke Transmission, Livonia Transmission, Sterling Axle and its Dearborn Truck Plant.
Overall, the goal is to renovate facilities, beef up the workforce and invest in technology that will lead to the production of more fuel efficient cars. In its statement, the automaker says a significant portion of this investment will go towards the production of six-speed transmissions, with the hope that in three years Ford’s entire fleet will feature the new technology.
The company has been trying to make the six-speed transmission more standard, recently making it available in its entire line of full-size pickup trucks. While many cars on the road feature four-speed automatic transmissions, the six-speed is superior when it comes to fuel economy because the extra overdrive gears keeps the engine speed low.
For those keeping score, the $850 million investment is in addition to the $950 million Ford has already committed for the overhaul of its Wayne, Michigan Assembly Plant, which will be tasked with churning out many of the company’s electric and hybrid models in 2012.
Although Ford’s road to recovery has been far from easy (and there’s still a way to go with consumer remaining fragile), it’s fared better than its domestic peers. Just last week, Secretary of Energy Steven Chu singled out Ford for recently passing Toyota’s rating in initial owner defects and its growing traction among consumers (citing a NYTimes article).
The automaker, which reports on Tuesday, is expected to showcase encouraging numbers with analysts looking for record (yes, record) third quarter profits of $1.37 billion (versus $997 million for the year ago period). Another quarter in the black will mean a string of six profitable quarters for Ford.

923,"Even If Solar Grows 30X, It Will Only Be 4% Of America's Power Capacity",https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/25/even-if-solar-funding-vc-bloomberg-photovoltaic/,2010/10/25,"
For all the talk about solar, the US market for solar power still has a long way to go before it makes a real dent in the country’s overall power capacity.
On Monday morning, Bloomberg New Energy Finance, a major aggregator of green industry data released a few key projections: the US solar market is on track to grow 30x to 44 gigawatts by 2020 and could make up 4.3% of America’s total power capacity. Of this fraction, the bulk (or approximately 68%) will be in photovoltaics with solar thermal making up the remainder.  Furthermore, Bloomberg predicts that consumer traction will also move noticeably higher, with 2.4% of homes solar-equipped by 2020.
Of course, that path to 4.3% of national power capacity is not cheap. In order to get there, the US market will need to attract $100 billion in investment dollars.
The possible leap from 1.4GW to 44GW is an impressive growth curve, but these figures certainly highlight the simultaneous growth and challenge of solar installation.
As Bloomberg New Energy Finance points out, the surge in solar capacity has been supported by two crucial trends: the drop in prices (the price of photovoltaic modules has tumbled from roughly $300 per watt in the mid-20th century, to less than $5 per watt today) and the heavy hand of government support. And yet, even as solar becomes more affordable, it’s still playing catch up to other sources of energy. That may be a well known fact but it often gets muffled in the bucolic vision for solar panel farms as far as the eyes can see.
“The group’s latest analysis places the unsubsidized cost of best-in-class photovoltaic and solar thermal electrivity generation at just below $200/megawatt hour— nearly four times the equivalent cost for a coal-fired power plant ($56/megawatt hour)— and between two and four times the cost of onshore wind power, ” according to the Bloomberg report.
On the investment front, it will be interesting to see how the solar industry fares in the money race. Overall, the sector has been a major beacon for investment dollars but momentum has recently waned. According to a Mercom Capital report for the third quarer,  VC funding for the solar sector was $169.35 million on 11 deals, versus $922 million for 18 transactions in the prior quarter. On the flip side, there was strength in other funding sources (including credit lines from banks), which totaled a healthy $20.7 billion for the quarter.

924,Innovalight Chief Awarded For Making Solar Cells (And Industry) More Efficient,https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/25/innovalight-ceo-burke-award/,2010/10/25,"
The chief executive and president of Innovalight, Conrad Burke, won the 2010 Ernst & Young Emerging Entrepreneur of the Year award, the companies announced today, following the ceremony in Dublin, Ireland earlier this week.  The award recognizes “entrepreneurs who are building and leading successful, growing and dynamic businesses” according to an E&Y press statement.
According to Innovalight’s website its silicon ink technology improves the photon to electron conversion efficiency of solar cells by one percent, which can drive the cost of solar energy down by six percent. Solar cells are semiconductor devices that convert photons from the sun into electrical current.
The U.S. Department of Energy backed Innovalight in 2008 with a $3 million grant for:
“…Developing very high-efficiency, low-cost solar cells and modules by ink-jet printing their proprietary ‘silicon ink’ onto thin-crystalline silicon wafers.  The company’s contact-less printing process has been demonstrated to significantly reduce both the manufacturing costs and the complexity required to make today’s highly efficient [solar] cells and modules.”

Under Burke’s leadership, Innovalight has developed sales through licensing and collaboration deals with solar manufacturers, rather than through the manufacture and sales of its own solar photovoltaics. The company’s customers are major manufacturers seeking to increase the megawatts-per-year that they produce per line without increasing expenditures on new equipment. These include several of China’s top solar concerns, among them Yingli Green Energy, JA Power and as of last week SolarFun Power.
In January this year, the company raised $18 million in a series D round led by EDB Investments (EDBI) of Singapore, and joined by Vertex Venture Holdings (the venture subsidiary of Temasek Holdings in Singapore) and its pervious investors: Apax Partners, ARCH Venture Partners, Convexa Capital, Harris & Harris Group, Sevin Rosen Funds and Triton Ventures. That brought Innovalight’s total raised capital, mostly from venture, to about $60 million.

925,"Venture Capital Sputters in the Third Quarter; Consumer Down, Business Services and Software Up",https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/25/venture-capital-sputters-in-the-third-quarter-consumer-down-business-services-and-software-up/,2010/10/25,"Dow Jones is releasing its third quarter venture capital numbers today, and the amount of money raised was down sharply from last quarter’s heady $7.7 billion distributed across 740 deals.
In the third quarter of this year, 662 companies raised just $5.4 billion. It’s not uncommon to see a muted third quarter in the venture business due to summer vacations, but this was the smallest amount raised in a summer quarter since at least 2005. Unless the fourth quarter outperforms, the industry will likely wind up in the same range as 2009’s total of $23 billion raised by US companies, which is down by about 30% from recent years. That’s not surprising given the dearth of IPOs and the fact that venture firm fundraising is down too.
Still, there were few interesting surprises in the numbers.
Researchers saw a shift in investor attention away from consumer products and services and towards business and financial services. Almost as many business and financial services companies have raised money in first nine months of 2010 as did in all of 2009. Consumer goods and services, on the other hand, saw one of its weakest quarters since the recovery. Although year-over-year the numbers for consumer products and services held up, there was a sharp drop in dollars on a quarter-over-quarter basis, down from $985 million in investments in the second quarter to $621 million this quarter. The reason could be as simple as timing. Several big deals may have just closed in the second quarter and not the third. But it could indicate a frustration with rising valuations and the general frothy consumer Web mood.
The number of cleantech and healthcare deals was pretty steady but, in terms of dollars, it’s a different story. Healthcare has been weak this year, but energy and utilities have surged. Year-to-date dollars going into energy companies are up a huge 47% to nearly $2 billion.
There was also a 26% uptick in the amount of money going to software companies– a cool $1 billion this quarter. “Software” is an inherently broad category, but it has historically been the venture industry’s largest and most consistently profitable one.
It’s a ho-hum quarter overall, but there are seeds of cleantech delivering on its promise, a new generation of enterprise companies and a meaningful disruption of the finance-industry. At a minimum, these numbers show that more entrepreneurs and VCs want there to be.
On a can’t-we-all-just-get-along note, the survey found that there was an increase in venture capital firms and angels doing deals together so far, year-to-date, although to be fair it’s a small $282 million in co-investment out of some $18 billion raised so far in 2010. Returns may be a different matter for this generation of funds, but in terms of money flowing out, this is still a VC’s business.

926,LDK Solar Inks $300 Million Deal With BYD,https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/25/ldk-solar-inks-300-million-deal-with-byd/,2010/10/25,"Several big names in solar have settled from recent highs on Wall Street, but there’s still a lot of money running into the sector.
On Monday morning, LDK Solar announced that it has locked up a new two-year sales deal with Chinese juggernaut BYD worth roughly $300 million. Under the deal, LDK will provide monthly shipments of polysilicon starting on January 2011.
It’s another win for the solar wafer manufacturer, which earlier this month raised its third quarter revenue guidance about 7% to a range of $610 to $640 million. In addition to raising its outlook, LDK noted that shipments of solar wafers and modules were outpacing demand.
For its part, the diversified BYD— which makes everything from automobiles to mobile phone batteries— has made no secret of its ambitions in green tech.
Earlier this year BYD announced that it will spend more than $3 billion over five years to construct one of China’s biggest solar power battery plant in Shangluo. Meanwhile, the company has also been working on large-scale energy storage solutions and their all-electric vehicle, the e6, is being prepped for a US debut. Although BYD (which Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has a 10% stake in) has struggled this year amid soft demand in China’s auto market, the company has seemingly maintained its aggressive stride in the green sector.
“We are very excited to add BYD, a leading high-tech enterprise that has a strong commitment to the green energy sector, as a key customer,” LDK’s CEO, Xiaofeng Peng said in a statement.

927,Secretary of Energy Chu: We Have Taken Our Technological Leadership For Granted,https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/22/secretary-of-energy-chu-we-have-taken-our-technological-leadership-for-granted/,2010/10/22,"Secretary of Energy and Nobel laureate, Steven Chu, dropped by the Googleplex on Friday for a fireside chat on renewable energy and the state of America’s green tech industry.
Speaking to Urs Hölzle, Google’s SVP of Operations, Chu told a room full of Googlers that although he was largely optimistic about America’s green future, he was frustrated by how much the US had fallen behind and how “we have taken our technological leadership for granted.”
Several times throughout the session, Chu brought up the example of China, a country that has been uber aggressive in funding green initiatives. He rattled off numerous examples of their unbridled ambition, including China’s plan to erect 25 nuclear power plants and the installation of “the highest voltage lines in the world to port renewable energy — they can now port electricity 1900 kilometers, at a 6% loss.”
By comparison, Chu says, America invented many of the world’s green technologies, but has dramatically stumbled behind, as rival countries have caught up, and in some instances, surpassed our efforts. He brought up the case of nuclear reactors, power electronics and solar cells (which were initially invented by Bell Labs, but the US now only has a 6% market share).
Despite the current bleakness, Chu says he has seen a few rays of hope. In the abstract form, he is comforted by the entrepreneurial spirit in green tech. Speaking more specifically, he’s encouraged by the glimmers of progress he sees in the troubled auto industry. Chu says the industry didn’t “just” have a near death experience, “it was a death experience,” but recently Ford passed Toyota’s rating  in initial owner defects and (citing a recent NY times article) has also impressed consumers by apparently building a better product.
“In order to compete you don’t go to Congress and ask for better shelter, you make better stuff,” he said.
Towards the end of his Q&A, Hölzle also asked Chu if he thought Google was doing enough in the arena of green tech.
Chu essentially said yes, applauding Google for its energy initiatives and approaching it with a pragmatic, capitalistic mindset. Although he doesn’t disparage altruism, he says real, sustainable transformation will come from solutions that are also appealing for selfish reasons. “I keep on telling my folks, or anyone that will listen… that saving energy is something you shouldn’t do because it’s a good and right thing…You save energy because you’re going to save money…You can get all the population [with], ‘do this because its good for you.'”
After the fireside chat, Chu was swiftly whisked away to meet with the primary energy leads at Google (in operations, investments, engineering, etc.) for a few closed-door meetings.

928,"In San Antonio, Greenhouse Gases From Sewage Are Saved And Sold As Energy",https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/21/new-san-antonio-biogas-plant/,2010/10/21,"
This week, a new biogas facility opened in San Antonio, Texas, and began turning greenhouse gases into a power source. Companies that partnered to develop and run the new facility are the San Antonio Water System (SAWS) which treats sewage and provides potable water and wastewater to about 1.3 million people in Texas, and Ameresco, a publicly traded energy services company.
The project captures methane gas that’s generated during sewage treatment, and directs this gas into a commercial, natural gas pipeline nearby so it can be sold, delivered and used as energy for heat and electricity generation. Typically, waste water facilities burn methane off in flares.
According to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency research methane is about 21 times more powerful at warming the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, and has a chemical lifetime in the atmosphere of approximately 12 years. Methane’s relatively short life, coupled with its problematic potency as a greenhouse gas, makes it a candidate for mitigating global warming within 25 years, the EPA suggests.
In a press statement, Robert R. Puento, the chief executive and president of SAWS said “This project is a sound investment for our environment and our community. By reusing biogas instead of burning it off, we are helping protect the city’s air quality and developing a renewable energy resource.”
Ameresco will treat and transfer at least 900,000 cubic feet of methane gas from SAWS wastewater plant to a nearby commercial gas pipeline, where they will sell it on the open market. The gas will be used and sold as energy, and some royalties on the sale of the biogas will be returned to the water company and its customers, reducing its cost of operations, overall. SAWS expects to generate at least $200,000 a year from biogas sales.
Biogas has remained somewhat scarce in the U.S. consumer energy market. Once biogas has been captured, it remains a challenge to transport it for use in fuel cells like the ClearEdge5 or the Bloom Box or other systems.
BioEnergy Solutions in Bakersfield, California has taken greenhouse gases from dairy manure, and directed it into Pacific Gas & Electric’s pipeline, and Cargill has embarked on a number of biogas projects worldwide, mostly involving agriculture industry projects, but Ameresco and SAWS claim theirs is the first biogas project of its kind in the country.
Environmentalists are eager to see more collaboration between large, public wastewater utilities and private sector or other companies that can help them curb methane emissions, while generating renewable, and low emissions energy.

Solar startup, 1366 Technologies is trying to do just that by innovating the manufacturing process with the hope of generating energy from “solar at the cost of coal” — a tag line prominently displayed on 1366’s homepage.
1366 Technologies is now one step closer. On Tuesday, the Lexington, Massachusetts-based company announced that it has raised $20 million in a Series B funding round from Ventizz Capital Fund, Hanwha Chemical (a highly diversified Korean chemical firm), and previous investors, North Bridge Venture Partners and Polaris Venture Partners.
In total, the firm has raised $37.5 million. 1366’s fundraising efforts include a $4 million grant from the Department of Energy, which was issued in 2009.
1366 Technologies business is centered around their so-called “Direct Wafer” technology, a manufacturing process that efficiently reduces silicon waste (and expense) by using molten silicon — from which they can directly create multi-crystalline wafers from.  More traditional methods often require several steps, including sawing and ingot casting, during which as much as 50% of silicon material can be lost.
“During the past two years, we have kept our cash position strong and focused on solving the key manufacturing challenges in silicon photovoltaic…Now, with this investment, we’re moving towards manufacturing. Our goal is to bring our transformative Direct Wafer technology into production,” 1366’s CEO Frank van Mierlo said in a statement.

930,Forceful Prediction: Apple Sunlight-Friendly Displays Would Scare The Daylights Out Of Competition,https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/19/apple-sunlight-friendly-displays/,2010/10/19,"
With nary a peep on the possibility of Apple baking a seeable-in-sunlight transflective display into the rumored 11.6” MacBook Air that’s expected to come floating up from the Pulpit of Jobs at Apple’s “Back to the Mac” tomorrow, I’d like to make a pretty safe prediction (read: offer unasked-for advice): An Apple-anything with such a display would make mobile-warriors’ and tree-huggers’ hearts flutter, and competitors’ hearts shudder.
Seeing the light on this one’s a no-brainer: Outfit the rumored MacBook Air—as well as all MacBooks, but especially iPads and iPhones and iPod touch models—with sunlight-friendly displays.  Suddenly, Apple’s the night-and-day winner when it comes to choosing and comfortably using your mobile devices in naturally-lit settings like outdoors on a picnic table or indoors in a brightly-lit room, while saving that not-always-handy resource known as power (the greatest percentage of which gets gobbled up lighting the screens of the above-mentioned products).
Sure, we witnessed this type of sunnyside-up screen on the Toshiba Portégé R600 which, in my book Green Gadgets For Dummies, I applauded for having earned the coveted title of Greenest Notebook in the 2008 Greenpeace Green Electronics Survey. From its eco-friendlier elimination of hazardous substances, to its smallest-possible recycled packaging, lightweight (2.4 lb) design, stay-put solid-state (SSD) drive option (not to mention a built-in DVD burner!), and that oh-so-readable-in-broad-daylight screen that helped the little wonder’s charge last throughout the entire workday, what wasn’t to love? Oh right, the price, which weighed in at around $2000. Hindsight being 20/20, the R600’s display that looked so darn eye-opening in 2008 has since been overshadowed by brighter, sharper, faster transflective displays like those being developed by Pixel Qi, the manufacturer behind the doubletake-worthy screen found in the Innoversal Lattice Tablet, for instance.
In other words, comparing transflective displays Now vs. Then is like comparing apples and oranges. Or any transflective-faced products by Apple with products by competitors with transflective visions of their own.
While Apple generally doesn’t like to take big risks with early-bird technologies, introducing such displays in the MacBook AIr first would be a great way to test the market’s appetite for them.  Even though employing costlier eco-friendlier transflective displays means forking more green from potential buyers’ wallet—adding perhaps $100 to $200 to the price of each device—the higher retail price wouldn’t dim sales in the least. Apple could start with the MacBook AIr, which is already its priciest notebook where it likes to introduce the most cutting-edge technologies such as all-flash memory.  People who buy MacBook Airs are not price sensitive.  Like Prius owners, potential buyers would pay more for that look-at-me-I’m-making-a-difference feeling of helping the planet by using less energy. (Or less magnanimously but more realistically put, to gain the power of using less power to achieve greater, all-day mobile-computing mileage between stops to the wall outlet). And let’s not ignore Steve Jobs’ uncanny talent for convincing audiences they’re getting more bang for their product buck with Apple than from less-pricy competing products which, on a purely spec-for-spec showdown, almost always offer a better value.
The difference this time—assuming we ever actually come face-to-face with Apple products outfitted with such transflective screens—would be that less actually is more: a little more expensive up front, but a lot less costly to the environment and your wallet over the longer-lasting gadget lifecycle haul.

931,"Brammo's Newest Electric Motorcycle, The Enertia Plus, Gets 80 Miles Per Charge",https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/19/brammo-enertia-plus-ev-motorcycle/,2010/10/19," The Oregon based electric motorcycle company, Brammo, today announced and began taking pre-orders for the Enertia Plus, the company’s fifth and latest model.
Set for delivery in 2011, the Enertia Plus comes with a 6.0 kWh Brammo Power Lithium Ion battery pack, and a manufacturer’s suggested retail price of $8,995.
(Electric motorcycles can qualify for federal and state tax rebates for electric vehicles.)
According to the company’s chief executive Craig Bramscher, the Enertia Plus is a zero-emissions motorcycle that will travel 80 miles on one charge, over 60 miles per hour, and should take about 6 hours to fully power up at any electric vehicle (EV) charging station with Level 1 capabilities. By contrast, Brammo’s debut machine, the Enertia, went only 40 miles on a single charge and used 3.2 kWh Valence-branded batteries.
Asked to compare the environmental impact of the Enertia Plus to that of a popular, current model of a classic motorcycle, Bramscher said “Our ‘wells to wheels’ calculations show an Enertia being 92% more efficient, and that’s assuming the dirtiest electricity in the U.S. — coal generated electricity — was used to charge it.”
The company is working on an electric vehicle battery take back and recycling program that Bramscher promised would be in effect by the time the Enertia Plus began to ship to customers in 2011.
Earlier this year, Brammo attained $12.5 million as part of a series B round of venture funding. The company is in the process of raising the second tranche of the series B round, targeting $30 million total now. Its financial backers include Alpine Inc., Chrysalix Energy Venture Capital and Best Buy Capital.
The Enertia Plus will sell at dealerships, including some Best Buy stores, according to a company press statement.
Brammo recently released the Empulse Trio line of electric motorcycles which use the same battery technology as will be featured in the Enertia Plus. The Empulse Trio bikes at the high end have a 100 mile per hour top speed, and can travel 100 miles per charge. The Empulse Trio bikes are race bikes, not meant for riding with a passenger. The Enertia Plus can accommodate a passenger.

932,"Dell, IBM Top Newsweek's List Of Most Environmentally Responsible Public Tech Companies",https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/18/dell-ibm-top-newsweeks-list-of-most-environmentally-responsible-public-tech-companies/,2010/10/18,"
Today, Newsweek released its environmental rankings of the 500 largest publicly traded companies in America, and internationally as measured by revenue, market capitalization, and number of employees.
The U.S. list included forty-nine tech sector companies. Their rankings were based on criteria including: “[the companies’] actual environmental footprint, management of that footprint (including policies and strategies) and reputation among environmental experts,” according to Newsweek’s methodology statement. 
Within the U.S. tech sector, the top ten most environmentally responsible companies were:

1	Dell
2	Hewlett-Packard
3	International Business Machines (IBM)
4	Intel
5	Sprint Nextel
6	Adobe Systems
7	Applied Materials
8	Yahoo!
9	Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
10	Cisco Systems

On the U.S. list, Google ranked 14th in tech and 36th overall, while Apple ranked 20th in tech and 65th overall. Since they scored points for their reputations and environmental policies, Yahoo made a surprisingly strong showing— it had a lower score than companies like Google, Microsoft and Motorola which, according to the researchers, did a better job controlling the size of their actual environmental footprint, and managing their impact on the environment.
The publicly traded company with the lowest rated reputation for environmental responsibility in the U.S. tech sector was Ingram Micro. The company with the weakest environmental policies on the list was NCR. And Corning did the worst job managing its environmental impact of all the companies listed.
The U.S. company with the best reputation for environmental responsibility among experts surveyed was IBM. Dell had the strongest rated environmental policies. Meanwhile, Sprint Nextel best controlled its footprint and managed its impact to the enviornment.
Newsweek’s Global Green Rankings measured the environmental qualities of “the biggest publicly traded companies in developed and emerging world markets,” naming IBM strongest overall and in the tech sector. The tech sector top ten, globally, included:

1	International Business Machines (IBM)
2	Hewlett-Packard
3	Deutsche Telekom
4	Toshiba
5	Vodafone
6	Nokia
7	Nippon Telegraph & Telephone
8	Microsoft
9	France Telecom
10	China Mobile

Only 14 tech companies made the Global Green Rankings this year.

933,"Ice Energy Closes $24 Million To Help Power Companies Beat The Heat, Efficiently",https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/18/ice-energy-seriesc-24million/,2010/10/18,"
Ice Energy, a Windsor, Colorado company, closed a $24 million series C investment to help electric utilities shift peak energy demands in the buildings they power to off-peak during hot weather. Investors in the round included TIAA-CREF’s Global Social and Community Investing Department, Good Energies, Energy Capital Partners, Sail Ventures and Second Avenue Partners.
The way Ice Energy’s technology works, at a basic level, is something like an icebox on a rooftop. During off-peak hours, the Ice Energy system makes ice (the regular, cold and watery kind) using available electricity to do so. Hopefully, some of that energy comes from intermittently available, clean, renewable sources like wind or solar. Throughout peak hours, the ice cools the building in lieu of traditional air conditioning which would further strain the power systems.
The chief executive and co-founder of Ice Energy, Frank Ramirez, described what makes the company distinct in an e-mail to TechCrunch, Monday:

[Ice Energy’s products are] directed at the air conditioning market for buildings that are three stories or less…They are the ones using refrigerant for air conditioning. This segment of the market represents 97% of all commercial buildings and 50% of commercial air conditioning electricity consumption. Ours is as a platform solution [including a] device that provides energy storage [and] controller on the device allowing intelligent operation at the site. The unit connect[s] over cellular to a network operations center that in turn is connected to a control room at [the power utility]. Utilities can direct control from single units up to the aggregated whole.
Ice Energy currently boasts 25 utilities as customers, and is working on a new pilot project with Toronto Hydro, and a large-scale project with the Southern California Public Power Authority (SCPPA).
Utilities can reduce the amount of fuel they consume in delivering electricity for air conditioning load by 30% to 50%, the company reported.
Investor Pete Higgins of Second Avenue Partners lauded Ice Energy for: 5 million hours of operational run time, its operational utility projects and a robust patent portfolio. Ramirez said his company would use its series C capital to fulfill a $115 million supply agreement with the Southern California Public Power Authority (SCPPA) and to drive new sales to utilities.

934,Crashing Washington: How CleanTech/Silicon Valley Can Have Their Cake And Eat It Too,https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/16/crashing-washington-how-cleantechsilicon-valley-can-have-their-cake-and-eat-it-too/,2010/10/16,"
Editor’s note: Guest writer Maury Litwack is a lobbyist, former Hill staffer, opinion writer and author of the recently published The Capitol Plan – A Comprehensive Washington Advocacy Strategy.
TechCrunch’s Sarah Lacy recently penned an article which laid out the complaints against government intervention in Silicon Valley, while at the same time presenting the challenges faced by the subset of tech leaders who favor subsidies—in CleanTech.  This paradox may have left some in the tech community frustrated at the obvious problem but without a clear solution. Is the government’s hand to be slapped away in all situations?  The solution isn’t really that difficult—it’s time for Silicon Valley to have its cake and eat it too.
Ordinarily, Silicon Valley as a whole can ignore the government, its players, and its traps because they are an independently-minded group which thrives on willing funders and growing consumer interest. CleanTech is different. CleanTech is large scale, which requires massive dollars, and transformative, which requires public policy. It is a large scale in that if fully realized it would include nearly every type of organization, from small non-profits to massive municipalities and states.  To get a feel for just how encompassing this technology is take a look at the many types of members are in the voluntary Chicago Climate Exchange.  Their membership numbers are a fraction of what could be in a full-scale exchange and gives some concept of the resources required.
CleanTech is transformative because it requires a fundamentally new way of doing business.  A commercial building has to rethink their bottom line, homeowners have to rethink how they pay their monthly bills, and municipalities have to rethink how they provide services.  Recycling took a while to implement and that just involved throwing one piece of trash from one bin to another.  Imagine the collective efforts of Americans trying to rethink everything from what types of windows to install in a small business to what kind of car to drive.  CleanTech is interested in the government because the funding there is massive.  Government is interested in the transformative angle because, some argue, only they have the capability to kickstart such a process.  If you want to get a feel for how much government cares then venture into Thomas (the official Library of Congress search page) and insert some CleanTech terms. I inserted “energy efficient” and found over 400 individual pieces of legislation introduced this past Congress.  CleanTech has a unique relationship with the government whether they like it or not.  The question is how to pursue it.
The tech community seemingly has before it two options. Ignore the government and lose out on existing funds or engage with the government and face possible regulation or unwanted intervention.  In June, Michael Arrington vented about how the Obama administration hadn’t fulfilled campaign promises important to Silicon Valley and how he didn’t think it was likely for any of these things to occur in this presidency. That seems to follow the non-engagement “get out of Silicon Valley” argument. Alternatively, in the engagement category, there is the recent statement by Google CEO Eric Schmidt to The Atlantic that “the laws are written by lobbyists.” Faced with a choice of “fight” or “flight,” neither scenario at its extreme particularly helps the CleanTech world.
If one were to follow the Arrington method to its extreme, there would likely be numerous foreign companies all too willing to grab the CleanTech mantle by paying lobbyists to push their case before Congress.  Foreign investment is moving along very nicely. The Chinese are investing $7.3 billion in smart grids and other technologies, the Japanese are rolling out an energy-smart city, and South Korea  is investing $200 billion in a smart grid project. South Korea is working on a free trade deal as we speak, so who knows what such an agreement would mean to CleanTech in our country. The “flight” approach is often taken by those who feel disenfranchised in Washington and decide to pack up their bags and declare “you leave me alone and I will leave you alone.”  But in this case, this could be a disastrous approach to advocacy which would leave an entire industry exposed to the whims of others.
However, if one were to follow the other model to the extreme, there would be a needless intrusion into one of our most promising fields. Politicians do love to intervene despite a lack of knowledge. Perhaps these same lobbyists Schmidt speaks of don’t understand Silicon Valley and wouldn’t fight the right battles to prevent government intrusion. Who knows what kind of weird relationships could transpire. One bizarre situation could play out eerily similar to the Canadian government’s privacy czar who recently told a conference of technology groups that the government expected them to shore up their privacy standards. Closer to home, as Lacy articulated, the financial services bill had all kinds of problems which venture capitalists and many other funding sources of the tech world couldn’t stomach. Was that a result of a sour relationship? To fully embrace the government and the potential revenues it represents could be a temporary solution but seems to be a bitter and controlling pill for our most innovative field to have to swallow.
Which lesser of two evils will it be? How can the CleanTech industry have its cake and eat it too?
What Silicon Valley and CleanTech needs are strong advocates in Washington.  Engagement with teeth is the right approach. Yes, I am a lobbyist, but hear me out.  This is already happening.  Politico wrote last week on the number of huge technology firms looking to beef up their lobbying in the next Congress. Twitter, HP, Facebook, you name it and they are there—fighting for net neutrality, privacy, mergers and other issues. Most big names in Silicon Valley are creating an equally big name in Washington and establishing clear markers for what they want and don’t want from the government.  Additionally, they are setting up serious in-house lobbying shops who know their products, and coupling them with strategic outside lobbying firms who know how the government works.
Many of you reading this may think Washington lobbying is just a waste of time and money.  But making your voice heard in Washington can be valuable and necessary. This approach—a constant, knowledgeable and forceful voice in Washington—is what an industry does to make sure they are getting what they need while at the same time not being taken advantage of. True, if one goes to the government only asking for a handout with lobbyists who don’t get it then the backlash can be lethal, but this doesn’t have to be the case. The American CleanTech industry can use their powerful voices as both constituents and an important engine of economic growth to argue for good policy and needed resources, while also making sure the government stays at arms length in most cases. Because ultimately, if they don’t do it, someone else will.

935,Ten Culprits Of The Global Water Crisis (And Startups Trying To Solve It),https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/15/water-crisis-facts-and-hope/,2010/10/15,"
Some 1.8 billion people have internet access in the world today, but 1 billion people lack access to adequate amounts of freshwater. Harsh realities about water inspired Blog Action Day this year, an initiative led by Change.org, to rally bloggers to explore the global problem, to raise awareness and money to help solve it. The issues around water in 2010 concern scarcity, access, pollution and more.
But it’s not all grim. There are new opportunities for tech startups, engineers, investors and creative people to solve problems around the water crisis. Water and waste water technology is a hot market that could get hotter.
Eight companies in this subcategory of cleantech ranked on the 2010 Global Cleantech 100 list  which we reported on earlier this week: Aqwise, Danfoss AquaZ, Emefcy, NanoH2O, Oasys Water, Ostara Nutrient Recovery Technologies, TaKaDu and WaterHealth.
A few others that were funded this year include: two water filtration companies Clean Filtration Technology and Quench; and an antimicrobial tech company, HaloSource which treats recreational and industrial water and aims to make drinking water safe.
We ran a story earlier today (that’s double Blog Action Day for TechCrunch) about i2O Water. The UK company was funded last year by First Capital and Swarraton Partners, and uses grid technology to save freshwater that would otherwise be lost through inefficient pipes, bursts and leaks in water systems.
We expect to see more startups and deals around water-related subcategories of cleantech, given the startling facts about global water supply and demand that are revealed in a comprehensive new Living Planet report by the WWF and Global Footprint.
Don’t blame us if you decide to drop out of school, quit your day job or ditch that other startup to work on something water-related after reading this list:

Of the world’s total estimated 6.5 billion population some 28% has internet access today, while 15% of the population doesn’t have enough freshwater to live a healthy life.

Seventy-one countries are experiencing stress on blue water resources, defined as sources of water that people withdraw, use and don’t return to the ecosystem. Nearly two-thirds (or 45) of these countries are experiencing moderate to severe stress.

 Countries experiencing blue water resource stress today are major producers of agricultural goods for national and global markets, including: India, China, Israel and Morocco. The strain on water resources will become more acute with increased human populations and economic growth, and be further exacerbated by the effects [of military conflict] and climate change. It will also make everything from energy to food more expensive.

Since 1900, more than half of the world’s wetlands have disappeared.

Overall, about one-third of the world’s 105 largest cities obtain a significant proportion of their drinking water directly from protected areas.

The “water footprint” of a typical, U.S. cup of black coffee is massive — an estimated 591.74 cups (140 liters). This includes all the water used for growing, harvesting, refining, transporting and packaging the coffee beans, selling the coffee, and brewing the final cup. It’s that big if you drink it out of a reusable mug.

 A latte-to-go with sugar has a water footprint of 845.35 cups (200 liters). The water footprint increases when ingredients are added, and will vary according to whether sugar, for example, came from sugarcane or sugar beet. If the final product is a takeaway coffee in a disposable cup, the water footprint will include the volume of water used to produce the cup as well as the water used to produce, deliver and make the coffee.

The United States has the third largest “production water footprint” in the world, after India which has the largest, then China. A production water footprint accounts for the volume of green water (a.k.a. rain) and blue water (withdrawn water ) that’s consumed in the production of agricultural goods from crops and livestock.

The agriculture industry forecasts that “a doubling of agricultural output without associated increases in the amount of land or water used” is possible by 2050.

The Living Planet Report tracks 714 species living in the world’s currently available freshwater, 636 species in marine water, and 1,341 terrestrial species. These marine and freshwater species declined 10% more than terrestrial from 1970-2007.

936,"Venture Dollars Drop 31 Percent In Third Quarter, Led By Decline In CleanTech Fundings",https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/15/venture-drop-31-percent/,2010/10/15,"
For all the hair-pulling that too much venture money is being thrown at startups, the third quarter actually saw a 31 percent sequential drop in venture dollars invested in the U.S., according to a new MoneyTree report from PriceWaterhouseCoopers and the National Venture Capital Association (see charts here).  In the third quarter, VCs invested $4.8 billion in 780 deals, down from $6.9 billion in 962 deals during the second quarter (note that they reported slightly different numbers at the time, but I am using updated numbers here).  Even compared to the third quarter of 2009, VC dollars are down 8 percent.
The biggest reason for the decline is that the second quarter was a huge quarter for later-stage cleantech deals, which are more capital intensive. The dollars going into cleantech went from $1.5 billion in the second quarter to $625 million in the third quarter, or a drop of nearly $1 billion.  There were also fewer cleantech deals, with 58 in the quarter compared to 78 in the second quarter.  And compared to last year, VCs poured $916 million into 53 cleantech deals in the third quarter of 2009.

While the bumpiness of cleantech investments explains most of the decline from last quarter, it does not tell the whole story.  Of the 17 different industry sectors the reoprt tracks, 14 were down.  For instance, $652 million less went into biotech and medical device startups compared to the second quarter.  Infotech was also down.  Software startups raised $1 billion in funding during the third quarter, down from $1.2 billion in the second quarter, but up from $800 million last year.  Of that $1 billion, $660 million was invested in Internet companies, down 25 percent from the second quarter and down 14 percent from a year ago.

But what about early-stage seed deals, where frothy valuations seem to be increasingly appearing?  A full third of all financing rounds (255 deals) and a quarter of the capital ($1.2 billion) went to first-time financings.  This mars the fourth consecutive quarter when first-time financings were more than $1 billion, and compared to a year ago, they’ve been growing as a percentage of all venture deals and dollars.

937,Follow The Solar Panel Road: Solar Roadways Wins First GE Ecomagination Challenge Award,https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/14/follow-the-solar-panel-roadways-ge-ecomagination/,2010/10/14,"It looks like the future may be paved with solar panels after all.
In early August, we told you about an out-of-the-box green tech company, named Solar Roadways, that had the audacious plan to replace America’s asphalt roads with textured, glass solar panels that could collect energy, distribute it and simultaneously serve up LED-powered signs (see video below). According to Solar Roadways’ founder Scott Brusaw, the idea is to install a massive solar panel network laid out end-to-end from California to New York that would dramatically change the energy landscape and the country’s literal landscape.
Sounds like a pipe dream, right?
At least that was my first impression— I wondered how the United States with its shoddy infrastructure (asphalt upkeep is hard enough) and burgeoning deficit could pay the $4.4 million per mile of road (per Bursaw’s calculations) to fulfill Brusaw’s vision. But I guess I was wrong. The collective web spoke and of the 3,500-plus applicants in GE’s Ecomagination Challenge, Solar Roadways won the first Challenge Award and $50,000— the equivalent of 5, 12’x 12′ panels.
Akin to the audience choice award, this Challenge prize was based on the community’s vote— roughly  74,000 submissions.
For those unfamiliar with the GE Ecomagination Challenge, it’s a partnership between GE and venture capital firms, Emerald Technology Ventures, Foundation Capital, KPCB and RockPort Capital, to invest $200 million in green tech technologies and startups. The core of the contest is five Innovation Awards, worth $100,000 each, which will be announced in early November. GE may also offer commercial relationships to the applicants.
Still far from the Innovation Award or a lucrative contract with GE, Solar Roadways hasn’t won the homecoming crown just yet. However, Bursaw told us on Thursday that the buzz around the Ecomagination challenge and their recent win has brought new eyeballs (about a 5x increase) to the website and the startup’s Facebook and Myspace pages. The win also doesn’t hurt the company’s chances in securing future funding. On top of the $50,000, Solar Roadways has already secured $100,000 from the Federal Highway Administration and is currently applying for a $750,000 FHWA contract.
Nine hundred thousand will not get Bursaw anywhere near his end goal— and Bursaw acknowledges that his dream would take several decades to complete, if it’s even possible— but he says there are smaller, pragmatic ways to deploy Roadways’ technology. For instance, the company has talked to national retailers like Wal-Mart about putting their panels in parking lots and powering the adjacent store/restaurant with solar energy. Of course, there are about 1,000 steps to go before Bursaw even gets there, like designing the glass structure and texture, improving traction, testing durability, manufacturing the panels on a large scale, etc.
So for now, I’ll believe it when I drive on it.

939,2010 Global Cleantech 100 List Dominated By American And Energy Efficiency Businesses,https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/14/2010-global-cleantech-100-list-dominated-by-american-and-energy-efficiency-businesses/,2010/10/14,"
The Cleantech Group LLC in conjunction with the UK’s Guardian News and Media, released their second annual Global Cleantech 100 list on Wednesday. The rankings recognize private, for-profit, independent cleantech companies that are most likely to make a significant, global market impact over the next five to ten years.
The top ranked, North American cleantech business on the list was Amyris Biotechnologies, which makes chemicals and biofuels from renewable sources. Amyris was initially backed by Kleiner Perkins Caulfield & Byers, Khosla Ventures and TPG Biotech. The company went public in late September; its stock is now trading on NASDAQ under the symbol AMRS for around $18.00.
This year, 3,138 qualifying companies were nominated for the Cleantech Group’s list. A panel of 60 judges appointed by the San Francisco, Calif. and London-based researchers made the final determinations. Fifty-five percent of the companies who made the list were headquartered in the United States. Energy efficiency represented the list’s dominant industry subcategory with 15 entries, though solar and biofuel companies followed closely behind, each with 14 entries on the list.
Backers of the Cleantech Global 100 companies this year hailed from 20 countries. Of the 226 funding organizations that invested in these cleantech leaders, VantagePoint Venture Partners funded more than any other. Their 13 portfolio businesses to grace the list were: Adura Technologies, AlertMe, Better Place, BrightSource Energy, Bridgelux, Chemrec, MiaSole, Ostara Nutrient Recovery Technologies, Serious Materials, Solarcentury, Solazyme, Tendril and Trilliant. Kleiner Perkins backed twelve Global Cleantech 100 companies that made this year’s list.
Last year, American businesses also dominated the list. Only 43 of the companies that ranked last year appeared again in 2010. Some, like Tesla Motors and A123, went public. Others were acquired. One went out of business.
Government funding agencies, and corporations that fund, acquire or partner with cleantech startups are having a bigger influence on cleantech businesses this year than last, the list researchers noted. Access to government funding can make or break a cleantech company, they cautioned.
One example from the 2009 Global Cleantech 100 list negatively impacted by this reality was Imara, a Silicon Valley lithium-ion battery developer that closed shop before 2010. The U.S. Department of Energy passed Imara over for grants and stimulus money, at which point its private investors decided not to add to their earlier rounds.
Imara faced tremendous capital requirements and an exit for its investors looked further and further away. The company would have had to pay for manufacturing overhead for months before generating revenue, and stood in competition against massive battery makers like Panasonic-Sanyo, Johnson Controls-Saft and a host of Asian battery manufacturing concerns that offer price competitiveness not yet seen by U.S. domestic players.
Cleantech businesses on the list that were bolstered by U.S. government grants, contracts and guaranteed loans or other financing included: BrightSource and Sustain X in solar, Amyris, Enerkem and Zeachem in biofuels, the electric vehicle makers Fisker Automotive, and sustainable plastics and materials startup Novomer.

940,Kiva President On The Next 5 Years And Why Zynga Is Their Biggest Rival (TCTV),https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/13/kiva-ceo-on-the-next-5-years-and-why-zynga-is-their-biggest-rival-tctv/,2010/10/13," 


Who is Kiva’s biggest competitor?
If you rattled off a list of non-profit-centric startups, the micro-lending site’s President Premal Shah would tell you that you’re dead wrong.
Try Zynga, the gaming behemoth that has given rise to Farmville and Mafia Wars and other disturbingly ubiquitous internet classics. What does virtual fertilizer have to do with micro-finance? Shah says a lot: It’s a never-ending fight for eyeballs and discretionary income.
“I think our biggest competitor is actually, probably Zynga. It’s not other nonprofits it’s actually competing for people’s attention. That fantasy football player in Canton, Ohio who might play two hours of Farmville at night, how do we get them to think about Uganda?…If building a real farm on Kiva can be as compelling as building a virtual farm on Facebook, then I think we’ve done our jobs really well.”
That perception will dramatically shape Kiva’s trajectory.
According to Shah, over the next few years, the non-profit will focus on the integration of game mechanics, social tools, mobile and new philanthropic verticals like green and water loans. In terms of numbers, Shah predicts Kiva will raise $1 billion in microloans by 2015.
Those are mighty goals when you consider that this startup only raised $500,000 in microloans in  2005, its first year of operation, and then $2 million in 2006.From those early months to today, it’s been a dramatic race up the hill for Kiva, which officially celebrates its 5th anniversary in San Francisco this evening.
Since it’s launch, Kiva has grown to 60 employees, operating in San Francisco, New York and a smattering of far flung locales, the organization has also added student loans and (somewhat controversially) loans to US citizens. Kiva’s very far away from the $1 billion mark, but Kiva has raised $170 million in microloans and assisted roughly 400,000 entrepreneurs. Kiva is currently raising $1 million every six days.
Kiva has proven itself to be beyond a fad and the robust growth trend seems to imply that Shah and co-founder Matthew Flannery do not have to worry about stagnation in the near term.
However, during our on an off camera interview, Shah was definitely anxious (as I believe a good president should be) about the changing nature of the web and whether Kiva was tardy in its efforts to innovate. Shah is cooking up an ambitious plan, which he will deploy over the next few years, to overhaul the site from design to structure— remaining true to its principles and its core mission, but adding layers that will make it more social, interactive and simply fun. Not quite a Foursquare (although there will be badges) or Zynga of philanthropy, but rather a more engaging nonprofit that borrows the most successful elements of these internet sensations.
“You can imagine us creating simple things like leader boards, so leaderboards by who’s the top lender in San Francisco. You can imagine us actually creating badges so for example,  a four basic food groups badge, if you lent to a business that sells meats, lends to one that sells dairy, lend to a vegetable farmer, lend to a fruit grower, you know you’d get the four food group badge. You can imagine us creating kind of different ways of personal achievement being realized on the website, I think that one of the most compelling things we can do is giving people a sense that by small actions in the present moment they can really affect the lives of someone else, so beyond just the gaming mechanic, it’s really kind of making sure that the feedback loop between the person that they’re trying to help is really strong and broad.”
On the mobile front, the company is already experimenting in Kenya, where they are working with a local partner to manage an SMS platform to facilitate conversation between Kiva and the people receiving loans (and eventually between lender and recipient). Depending on this  pilot program, Kiva will ultimately roll out this feature to other locations.
Shah is on the right path here.
Unlocking mobile, social and gaming (which the site has not really leveraged) could easily propel Kiva to the $1 billion mark by 2015, or well before. However, there is one major obstacle — one that Shah acknowledges is legitimate, if not issue number one.
Regardless of the roadmap, Kiva needs high quality engineers to come on board. Right now the team has 10, Shah would like to at least double that. He says the hope is to hire 15 people for Kiva’s staff this year, with the majority of that being engineers.
It’s challenging for any startup to recruit Silicon Valley’s top engineers, but for a nonprofit (which generally pays somewhere below the top salary bracket) it’s an especially frustrating task. When I asked Shah why he thought Kiva was not more effective in recruitment, he said part of the problem was a lack of awareness and the cultural attitudes towards the nonprofit sector: “Part of it is people when they think of nonprofits it’s something that they do once a year, maybe around the holidays, a lot of us in the back of our minds wanted to do something all our lives, but only after something happens, like once I retire type of thing. I actually think there’s a growing consciouness…of a lot of people who are talented developers or product managers who want to do something like Kiva just didn’t know that the opportunity exists.”

941,"Energy Efficient Lighting Startup, Redwood Systems, Aglow With $15 Million Funding",https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/13/redwood-15million-funding-led/,2010/10/13,"
Redwood Systems, a Fremont, Calif. company that makes and installs network-based light emitting diode (LED) lighting control systems for commercial buildings attained a $15 million series b round of funding, the company announced today. Index Ventures led the investment, and was joined by the company’s earlier backers Battery Ventures and U.S. Venture Partners. Neil Rimer, co-founder and partner of Index Ventures, will join Redwood’s board of directors.
Chief executive and co-founder of Redwood Systems, Dave Leonard, said he would invest the new-found capital in the near term on “Scaling to build and produce the [lighting systems], sell them, create demand and support customers mostly, and on research and development.”
With 42 full-time employees currently, Redwood Systems works with technology partners around Silicon Valley to produce its energy efficient lighting systems, and with electrical contractors to install them. According to its website, Redwood Systems provide 50-80% reduction in electricity consumption versus flourescent lighting in an equivalent space.
Prior to co-founding Redwood Systems, CEO Leonard was the vice president and general manager of Cisco System’s Desktop Switching Business Unit. Asked if he had an exit strategy in mind for his lighting systems startup, including an eventual acquisition by Cisco, Leonard said “Discussions about the company’s potential acquisition, or whether to go public will be in line with the market for LED and lighting controls when it hits its pace, probably in 2012 or later.”
The company is currently focused on selling to building owners in markets where electricity costs a lot, relative to national average rates, including Boston, Washington D.C. and New York City, and throughout the West coast. “The difference in cost of electricity between Oklahoma and NYC is a factor of 4,” Leonard observed. He also said that Redwood Systems work especially well for building owners who are replacing flourescent lighting with LED lighting.
Redwood Systems’ technology works somewhat like ethernet works for an office full of computers, connecting LED lights that are equipped with micro-sensors to a central power source and command center. The sensors in each light control the power, dimming and brightness of the lights. The lights can be set to dim automatically as sunlight streams into a room, or to brighten when somebody walks into a room. Individuals can adjust LED light bulbs over their work space through a web browser and site that functions like a password protected remote control.
In 2009, lighting accounted for 14% of U.S. electricity use, according to reports by the Department of Energy. LED lights can be two to four times more efficient than incandescent lights and compact fluorescents. Unlike flourescents, which are the most commonly installed in office buildings in the U.S. today, LED light bulbs contain no mercury.

942,Another Video Of Google's Automated Toyota Prius (On Its Campus) Arrives,https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/13/google-car-campus/,2010/10/13,"

If you’re going to be testing unmarked automated cars in the field, inevitably people will get curious and – because it’s 2010 and all – whip out their video cameras or cellphones to record them in action. If you’re Robert Scoble, you’ll even do it while driving.
Hence the video of Google’s awesome automated Toyota Prius cars we posted earlier (as well as Scoble’s).
But here’s one that was captured last March at the Googleplex, stopping for a red light, giving the guy who recorded the video (hat tip to Van Tucker) the chance to get some close-ups of the car and the sensor that’s mounted on top.
I’m terribly excited about the prospects of automated cars becoming the trend in, say, a decade or so. And you’ll get to brag that you watched one of the first videos of Google testing the technology on the road back in 2010. Unless it flops, of course, in which case you’ll still get to say you watched a video of another thing Google cooked up but never got anywhere.
Still, kudos for the desire to innovate, you Mountain View idealists you.

943,HEY GOVERNMENT! GET OUT OF SILICON VALLEY! (Unless You've Got CleanTech Subsidies of Course),https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/12/hey-government-get-out-of-silicon-valley-unless-youve-got-cleantech-subsidies-of-course/,2010/10/12,"
The government is like that nerd who crashes a high school party. No one has any use for him….until they figure out he’s got a fake ID and can buy the beer.
Despite its liberal leanings, Silicon Valley has always been hostile to government intervention when it comes to business. We don’t ask for bailouts when things go badly and in exchange, we want private equity investing as unregulated as possible. Even the most modest regulation around stock option grants, venture capital or angel investing is met with screams that innovation as we know it will be crushed.
And all of this with very good reason: DC doesn’t understand Silicon Valley and vice-versa. Red tape is antithetical to the nimbleness startups prize as their main competitive advantage, many entrepreneurs and investors don’t even own a suit, and the general belief here is smaller is better, bigger is just a necessary evil that comes with success. You get stuff done in DC by hiring a lobbyist cajole lawmakers. You get stuff done in the Valley by, well, getting stuff done. Even when it comes to fears that the SEC has so horribly bungled the capital markets that companies can’t go public anymore, the Valley still would rather have fewer government restrictions on Wall Street, not more.
But in the corner of Silicon Valley that invests in clean tech….well, it’s all “Come on in, Uncle Sam! Make yourself comfortable! Um…..can we have some subsidies, now?” According to DLA Piper’s annual survey of tech leaders 84% of respondents said they favored tax incentives and other active government involvement in the sector. Simply put: There’s a massive funding gap for some of the largest clean tech opportunities– whether it’s solar energy on every rooftop or a massive grid of electric car charging stations. Just ask Google– a company spending billions of its advertising riches to jumpstart renewable energy markets. Said Curtis Mo, a partner at the law firm that conducted the survey: “The capital requirements and ROI timing for CleanTech are not ideal for the current venture capital model. The infrastructure and financing requirements are massive, often in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Clearly, venture capital will play an important role, but government and alternative forms of private financing will play an equally, if not more, critical role.”
The clock is ticking. Unlike the early days of computers and the Internet when the Valley could dominate at its own pace, CleanTech is a global opportunity and countries like Brazil, China and Germany are already beating the US in many respects. Why? Well, a lot of it is because their governments give them subsidies. With every large market in the world craving cheaper, cleaner energy solutions and plenty of venture money flying around to support innovation wherever it find it, US companies are suddenly at a huge disadvantage. And only an uneasy friendship with Uncle Sam can balance the playing field.
And according to the survey, a lot is riding on such a detente. Respondents listed CleanTech as one of the most promising areas for tech growth. Without any help? The money seeking those opportunities and eventually the jobs that will result from them will flow elsewhere.

944,"Solar Electricity To Power 200,000 U.S. Homes By End of 2010",https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/12/seia-half-year-report/,2010/10/12,"
Solar is likely to surpass one gigawatt of installed, power-generating capacity this year in the U.S. — that’s enough capacity to power 200,000 homes — according to a report released today by the Solar Energy Industries Association and GreenTech Media Research.
The researchers believe that photovoltaic (PV) and concentrating solar power (CSP) installations in the states are on the rise thanks to decreasing prices and continued government support of domestic solar projects. One large CSP project and several large PV projects contributed to the robust forecast.
The Israeli-developed, California-based clean tech company BrightSource Energy attained federal approvals this year to build a major, 370 MW CSP installation in Southern California, including about 10 “power towers” on federal lands. This Ivanpah project has created high hopes for a BrightSource IPO this year, though a 2011 IPO is more likely.
BrightSource is backed by Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Morgan Stanley and VantagePoint Venture Partners, Alstom SA (ALS), Black River Asset Management, BP Alternative Energy, the California State Teachers Retirement System, Chevron Technology Ventures, Google.org and StatoilHydro, and as Dow Jones Venture Wire reported, it received the largest loan guarantee that the federal government has issued to any clean-technology company.
PV projects took off, too.  The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) tracks these PV projects in the US via an open source map project, OpenPV.NREL.gov. A quick search reveals some of the larger projects installed this year, including a $71 million plant in Florida at the Kennedy Space Center, consisting of 35,000 solar panels that should power more than 1,000 homes.
SEIA’s industry report predicts that of the 945 megawatts of solar electric capacity that is expected to be added domestically this year, 91% should come from PV and 9% from CSP installations. Last year, just 441 megawatts of solar electric capacity were added domestically from PV and CSP combined.
Political support for solar is also strong. The newest SCHOTT Solar Barometer Survey, conducted by SEIA and Kelton Research, found that 94% of U.S. citizens think it is important for the nation to develop and use solar energy, across all political parties and 80% agree that Congress should consider reallocating federal subsidies from fossil fuels to solar.
In the first six months of the year, California took the lead among states with solar electric capacity installed adding 120 megawatts. New Jersey, Arizona and Florida followed. Across the U.S. 341 megawatts were installed in the first half of the year.
The U.S. is also expected to reach 3 million square feet of installed solar thermal collectors for solar water heating, compared to about 2.6 million square feet in 2009. Newly installed collectors should provide hot water for nearly 50,000 homes, businesses and other facilities across the country.
Hawaii installed the most square feet of solar water heaters, followed by Puerto Rico and California in the first half of 2010. Within the solar water heating industry, the solar pool heating segment is expected to grow by 7% in 2010, with installations of approximately 11.5 million square feet.

945,Sizing Up Symantec's Corporate Social Responsibility,https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/12/symantec-csr/,2010/10/12,"Symantec, the software and security company best known for its Norton internet security and antivirus software, released its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) report on Monday.
For the uninitiated, CSR reports put a company’s social and environmental objectives, not just their profit and revenue outlook, on the record. They are meant to encourage all businesses, no matter their size, to act in a people and planet friendly manner. In Europe, companies are required to report on such issues but not so in the U.S. Symantec began CSR reporting voluntarily in 2008.
The company’s latest environmental goals include: reduction of CO2 emissions company-wide by 15% by the end of fiscal year 2012, using 2008 as a baseline; and meeting LEED certification for existing, and new buildings, especially data centers. LEED certifications were developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC).
With all these plans, is Symantec now a green technology company? Nah. It does offer an enterprise product, Altiris, that Symantec claims will “reduce energy and costs” for organizations that use it to manage their client PCs.  Still, Symantec’s products focus on keeping people, systems and information safe, and their data safely stored. The company isn’t shifting its focus to solving the world’s energy and climate problems, just because it is doing more with its CSR report and policies.
Symantec didn’t do such a good job of growing without polluting in the past year, it admits in its fiscal year 2010 Performance Summary highlights:
“[A] global four percent increase in CO2 pounds per square foot… The key factor in this fiscal year Scope 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) increase is the expansion of our enterprise data center resulting from a change in our business strategy to include hosted and storage services.”
A partner and creative director at Methodologie in Seattle, Dale Hart, has been helping companies design annual and CSR reports in print and online for two decades. He checked out the latest from Symantec and offered praise and pointers. (Symantec was a Methodologie client about a decade ago, but has no current affiliation with the agency.)
First the good…
“Symantec has a button on their home page that leads to their CSR report. That’s great visibility. They also published testimonials from the president and chief executive, and from the chief of marketing about the company’s CSR report and related policies. That is something you don’t typically see from large, Fortune 500 type companies. Executive buy-in lets stakeholders know there’s discussion about sustainability issues from the top down. It indicates authenticity,” Hart said.
He also lauded Symantec for having an advisory board for environmental and social guidance, comprised of leaders from non-government (NGOs) and labor relations organizations, as well as ethical businesses.
Symantec reported against standards established by the Global Reporting Index, or GRI. The GRI helps companies figure out what content to include in a CSR report, what’s meaningful and measurable, and how they can make this information easily understandable to stakeholders in their business. It’s kind of a more worldly version of a 10-K, and Hart believes it is among the best ways to standardize CSR reporting.
Symantec’s director of corporate responsibility, Cecily Joseph, also discussed the merits of the GRI with TriplePundit this week.
Still, there was also something lacking in the company’s report, Hart said.  He would like to see more U.S. tech firms, including Symantec, reveal more and more consistently about the way they deal with mercury and other toxins in the hardware and software they buy, use and produce. He’d also like tech businesses (and others) to disclose what they are doing with outsourcing partners, and in developing countries.
“Whether or not a company owns manufacturing facilities outside of the U.S., and especially if they do not own them, how do they enforce worker safety, fair labor and environmental best practices there? That should be more readily apparent,” said Hart.

946,Google Backs Biggest U.S. Offshore Wind Project,https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/12/google-wind-project/,2010/10/12,"

Continuing its strategy of using its cash to kickstart renewable energy businesses, Google is now backing the largest U.S. offshore wind farm project to date.  The Atlantic Wind Connection is a proposed string of offshore wind turbines that will stretch 350 miles off the Atlantic coast from Virginia to New Jersey.  Once completed, the project will produce 6,000 megawatts of power, which is equivalent to 60 percent of all the wind power built in the U.S. last year.  The wind project will serve nearly 2 million homes.
The entire project is expected to cost about $5 billion, but Google is only investing in the first phase to help get it off the ground (or, rather, out to sea).  The first phase includes only getting the necessary governmental approvals and financing before the wind power line can actually begin construction.  While it is the least expensive part of the process, it is actually the trickiest because of popular opposition to offshore wind farms in general.  Other investors include Good Energies and Marubeni Corporation.
Google has invested in wind projects before and entered into long-term contracts to purchase wind power.  It’s last wind energy investment was $38.8 million, and this one will likely end up in the same range.  Development stage costs for these kinds of projects usually run in the tens of millions of dollars.  A Google spokesman says there are no related tax rebates or other benefits associated with the investment, rather Google is hoping to make a straight-up financial return.

947,Formative Labs Will Turn Energy Saving Into A Game On The Wings Of Impressive Angels,https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/11/formative-labs-funding/,2010/10/11,"I think we’re all well aware by now that we need new forms of energy to continue to have a future on this planet in the long-term. It’s hugely important — but it’s also not something that is going to be solved overnight. But there are plenty of things we can all do right now to conserve the forms of energy we do have. And while the cost-saving angle motivates some people, it’s often confusing because many solutions require you spend more money upfront to save in the long run. Formative Labs has a different solution to get people to conserve.
While they’re still working on building their product, and founder/CEO Jessica Alter doesn’t want to give too much away, she does tell us that a key to what they’re going to do revolves around game and social mechanics. It’s about creating a consumer experience that entices people to change their behavior, she says. Hopefully, part of that is guilting them into conserving more energy when friends boast about how much they’re saving — I love those types of mind games.
And today Formative Labs is announcing an angel round of funding from an impressive roster of angels: Jeff Clavier, Keith Rabois, Dave McClure, Ben Ling, and Karl Jacob. These angels are betting that Alter and her team can use their social experience to lead to real change in the space. Alter was previously the Director of Platform and Business Development at Bebo. The amount of funding has not been disclosed.
Formative Labs was one of the groups that was initially working out of San Francisco’s Dogpatch Labs alongside companies like Burbn (now Instagram), StickyBits, Formspring, and FanPulse (now Fanvibe). Alter notes they have their own space now. She says that they’ll be launching their first product into beta testing soon.

949,Why? Because They Can!,https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/09/why-because-they-can/,2010/10/09,"I just don’t get people who live on the East Coast. On the one hand you’ve got Newsweek’s Dan Lyons saying Silicon Valley isn’t tackling the hard problems any more (our response is here).
And then when we find out that Google is actually working on some seriously science fiction type stuff (self driving cars), New York financial analyst and blogger Henry Blodget asks “Why is Google developing this technology?”
I get what Lyons and Blodget are saying. Lyons thinks Zynga, Twitter and Facebook are a waste of engineering resources. Those people could be working on “more important stuff.” And Blodget isn’t anti-self driving cars, he just wants Google to focus on its core business.
I say this – who cares!
Everyone has a fix for Silicon Valley, but what tends to work best is when people just leave Silicon Valley alone. The crazy (perhaps diseased) manic pipe dreams of entrepreneurs, guided by basic market forces, has gotten us this far. And it will work just as well from now on, too.
I love the fact that Google is working on cars that drive themselves. I’m not a shareholder, but if I was I’d still love it. If Larry Page decides this is what he’s passionate about right now, Google definitely doesn’t want him starting some new company to pursue it.
Keep it at Google. If it doesn’t work, he’s scratched his itch. If it does, they can spin it off later. In the meantime, Google benefits because people know they’re working on new technology that can change the world, not just how to make more money from keyword ads. There are engineers that may take jobs at Google just knowing that they’re doing stuff like this that otherwise take jobs at one of those companies that Lyons is mocking just to get pre-IPO stock.
We want our entrepreneurs to try crazy new things. In a hundred years who knows, Google may be thought of as a car company, not a search company. Crazier things have happened. It wasn’t all that long ago, for example, that Nokia was known as a manufacturer of rubber galoshes. If Blodget had his way, they’d still be at it.

950,"Google's Self-Driving Car Spotted On The Highway Almost A Year Ago (Oh, And Scoble) [Video]",https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/09/google-car-video/,2010/10/09,"In November 2009, Ben Tseitlin was driving along on the 280 highway between San Francisco and Palo Alto when he noticed something weird. There was a Toyota Prius next to him with a weird spolier-like thing on the roof. And on top of that was some sort of spinning contraption. It was weird enough that Tseitlin decided to take a video of it and posted it to his Facebook page, guessing it was sort of test wind-powered Prius. Little did Ben know at the time, it was actually something much more.
What Tseitlin captured, of course, was the Google self-driving car. The secret project, which Google revealed for the first time today, is a combination of different technologies developed by Google that will allow a car to drive itself — yes, even on the highway. Google has disclosed that they’ve been testing these cars “recently“, but they’ve clearly been testing them for longer than that, as Tseitlin’s video proves. The fact that these specially-equipped Priuses (and one Audi TT) have racked up over 140,000 miles (1,000 of while have been completely human-free) on the road, suggests a longer cycle of testing as well.
One of the most interesting aspects of this whole project is that local authorities were fine with Google road-testing these cars. “We’ve briefed local police on our work,” Google noted today and said that human beings are always present in the driver’s seat when the cars are on the road just in case a manual override is needed. The only accident over all these months involved someone else rear-ending one of the cars.
Tseitlin tells us that he’s actually seen the cars around a few other places as well in the past several months. A commenter on his Facebook post notes the same thing.
Google’s secret project has been driving next to many of us all these months and we never ever realized it. That won’t be the case anymore. Watch Tseitlin’s video below.

Update: And none other than Robert Scoble caught the car on video in January 2010 — but he assumed it was the new Street View car. His comment on the video page is funny:
They must be testing the latest Mapping car a lot lately. Seems I see them on almost every trip. I’m not sure what company they work for, I’ve always assumed Google but I see these cars quite frequently in Silicon Valley. This time I had my HD camera ready. Note that there’s two cameras on top: one that looks like it’s recording video (the black thing on top) and one that’s recording stills (the rotating camera). Also note that they didn’t like me shooting video, when they noticed me they slowed down quickly.
There was a reason they didn’t like him shooting that footage. Also – eyes on the damn road, Robert! This is exactly why we need these cars.

951,"World-Changing Awesome Aside, How Will The Self-Driving Google Car Make Money?",https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/09/google-car/,2010/10/09,"
Google made a stunning revelation this morning: the existence of a secret self-driving car project. Even more amazing: it has been in testing for months, on actual roads across California, and things seem to be running smoothly. Fans of Total Recall, Minority Report, and Knight Rider are hyperventilating at the prospects. And while the technology is likely still a long way from being widely implemented (The New York Times piece on it suggests eight years), there is one big question: why?
Google’s answer seems to be a “betterment of society” one. “We’ve always been optimistic about technology’s ability to advance society, which is why we have pushed so hard to improve the capabilities of self-driving cars beyond where they are today,” Google engineer Sebastian Thrun, who spearheaded the project (and also runs Stanford’s AI Labs, and co-invented Street View), writes today.
That’s great. But Google is still a public company in the business of making money for its shareholders. So one can’t help but wonder what, if any, money-making prospects there are here?
“The Google researchers said the company did not yet have a clear plan to create a business from the experiments,” according to the NYT. Further, they quote Thrun as saying that this project is an example of Google’s “willingness to gamble on technology that may not pay off for years.”
We know Google has a history of idealism — co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, in particular — but this project cannot come cheap. And the fact is that Google remains basically a one-trick-pony when it comes to making money. They are so reliant on search advertising revenues, that if something suddenly happened to the market, they’d be totally screwed. Android may prove to be their second trick, but it’s not there yet.
But there may be more to these automated cars than just an awesomely cool concept. At our TechCrunch Disrupt event a couple weeks ago, Google CEO Eric Schmidt gave a speech about “an augmented version of humanity.” He noted that the future is about getting computers to do the things we’re not good at. One of those things is driving cars, Schmidt slyly said at the time. “Your car should drive itself. It just makes sense,” he noted. “It’s a bug that cars were invented before computers.”
If your car can drive itself, a lot of commuters would be freed up to do other things in the car — such as surf the web. One of Google’s stated goals for this project is to “free up people’s time”. That matched with Schmidt’s vision of mobile devices being with us all the time every day, likely will translate into more usage of Google.
That may sound silly and not worth all the R&D an undertaking as huge as this will require, but don’t underestimate Google. This is a company who cares deeply about shaving fractions of a second off of each search query so that you can do more of them in your waking hours. Imagine if you suddenly had an hour or more a day in your car to do whatever you wanted because you no longer had to focus on driving? Yeah. Cha-ching.

Or imagine if your on-board maps where showing you Google ads. Or you were watching Google TV in your car since you didn’t have to drive. Or you were listening to Google Music with Google ads. It’s all the same. This automated driving technology would free you up to use more Google products — which in turn make them more money. Make no mistake, Google will enter your car in a big way. And automated driving would up their return in a big way.
And, of course, none of this speaks to what, if anything, Google would actually charge for such technology implementation. You would have to believe that if and when it’s available, this automated driving tech would be built-in to cars. Would car manufacturers pay Google for it and pass off some of the costs to customers? Or would this all be subsidized by the above ideas?
It’s way too early to get into that, I’m sure. And in 8 years, there will be things out there that we can’t even imagine right now. But it’s interesting to think about. The Google Car.
Now, don’t get me wrong, I have little doubt Google is being sincere in their broader hopes for such a technology. Here’s their key blurb on that:
According to the World Health Organization, more than 1.2 million lives are lost every year in road traffic accidents. We believe our technology has the potential to cut that number, perhaps by as much as half. We’re also confident that self-driving cars will transform car sharing, significantly reducing car usage, as well as help create the new “highway trains of tomorrow.” These highway trains should cut energy consumption while also increasing the number of people that can be transported on our major roads. In terms of time efficiency, the U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that people spend on average 52 minutes each working day commuting. Imagine being able to spend that time more productively.
That first part is awesome. If we could halve the number of traffic deaths each year, it would be world-changing. And if energy consumption could be cut, it could re-shape economies and save our future. But again, don’t gloss over the last part. Freeing up those 52 minutes a day to be productive — that’s a lot of potential money for Google.
And that’s great too. If Google can spend the time and money working on such amazing technology they should be rewarded for it. There’s no rule that says you shouldn’t be able to make money by changing the world. And Google can’t be praised enough for trying.

952,"Google Has A Secret Fleet Of Automated Toyota Priuses; 140,000 Miles Logged So Far.",https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/09/google-automated-cars/,2010/10/09,"
It all makes sense now.
At our TechCrunch Disrupt event a couple weeks ago in San Francisco, Google CEO Eric Schmidt took the stage to give an impressive speech across a wide range of topics. But the most interesting thing he had to say what about automobiles. “It’s a bug that cars were invented before computers,” he said. “Your car should drive itself. It just makes sense.”
Well guess what? Surprise, surprise: Google has been working on a secret project to enable cars to do just that.
As they’ve revealed on their blog today, Google has developed a technology for cars to drive themselves. And they haven’t done it on a computer, or in some controlled lab, they’ve been out on California roads testing this out. “Our automated cars, manned by trained operators, just drove from our Mountain View campus to our Santa Monica office and on to Hollywood Boulevard. They’ve driven down Lombard Street, crossed the Golden Gate bridge, navigated the Pacific Coast Highway, and even made it all the way around Lake Tahoe. All in all, our self-driving cars have logged over 140,000 miles. We think this is a first in robotics research,” Google engineer Sebastian Thrun (the brainchild of the project who also heads the Stanford AI lab and co-invented Street View as well) writes.
Further, The New York Times, which has a bit more, says a total of seven cars have driven 1,000 miles without any human intervention (the 140,000 mile number includes occasional human control, apparently). These cars are a modified version of the Toyota Prius — and there is one Audi TT, as well.
So how does this work? The automated cars use video cameras, radar sensors, and a laser range finder to locate everything around them (these are mounted on the roof). And, of course, they use Google’s own maps. But the key?
This is all made possible by Google’s data centers, which can process the enormous amounts of information gathered by our cars when mapping their terrain.
Google says it gathered the best engineers from the DARPA Challenges (an autonomous vehicle race that the government puts on) to work on this project. They also note that these cars never drive around unmanned in the interest of safety. A driver is always on hand to take over in case something goes wrong, and an engineer is always on hand in the car to monitor the software. Google also says they’ve notified local police about the project.
So has it worked? Apparently, yes. There has been one accident so far, but it was when someone else rear-ended one of these Google cars.
Google notes that 1.2 million people are killed every year in road accidents — they think they can cut this number in half with the tech. It will also cut energy consumption and save people a lot of time.
I want this yesterday. This is all kinds of awesome.
But don’t get too excited just yet. “Even the most optimistic predictions put the deployment of the technology more than eight years away,” according to NYT.

953,How To Replace Styrofoam With Mushrooms,https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/08/eplace-styrofoam-musrooms/,2010/10/08,"

Lately at my house we’ve been getting a lot of packages. And with packages, comes styrofoam.  My three-year-old loves styrofoam.  Me, not so much.  He breaks it up and it makes a huge mess.  The little bits get everywhere and they are impossible to clean up.  I can only imagine that multiplied by 100 million homes in the U.S. alone.
Styrofoam is everywhere, but nobody really thinks about it.  It is a $20 billion dollar business in the U.S. and occupies an estimated 25% of the country’s landfill by volume.  But Eben Bayer is thinking about it.  He is a greentech entrepreneur who recently gave a TED talk (embedded below) where he describes the problem and what he is trying to do about it.  Instead of using styrofoam packaging, which is a petroleum-based plastic that pretty much never goes away, he and his team have come up with a way to use mushrooms and agricultural waste such as seed husks to grow bio-degradable packaging material.
If you think about it, styrofoam really should be replaced with something that is compostable.  It generally only has to last during shipping to protect items.  But once it arrives at your home, it is the first thing you throw away (if your kids don’t destroy it first).  Bayer is the CEO of Ecovative Design, which literally grows packaging materials from mycelium, a substance found in fungi, and various seed husks.  It can be molded into any shape and takes about 5 days to grow.
The big question that remains is how much does this cost, and can it compete with styrofoam at scale?

954,"Sustainable Brand Setbacks: Tesla Roadsters Recalled, SunChips Packaging Shelved",https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/07/sustainability-setback/,2010/10/07,"
Advocates for environmentally sustainable business are having a rough week. Two products beloved by the movement, the Tesla Motors Roadster, an all-electric vehicle,  and PepsiCo Frito-Lay’s SunChips, the snacks sold in biodegradable bags, are suffering setbacks.
Tesla  voluntarily recalled Roadster models 2.0 and 2.5 when the company heard from a customer with this problem:

[A] low voltage auxiliary cable in [the] vehicle chafed against the edge of a carbon fiber panel in the vehicle causing a short, smoke and possible fire behind the right front headlamp of the vehicle. This issue [involved the] 12V low voltage auxiliary cable and… not the main battery pack or main power system. 
Tesla’s stock price, which remained steady immediately after the Oct. 1st recall, dipped more than 3% within the week as media and industry analysts discussed the Tesla Roadsters’ fire risk along with the company’s looming expenses and competitive outlook.
Tesla’s chief executive Elon Musk will soon have to cut checks for: recruiters to bring in hundreds of new engineers and their salaries; continued work on a new, Model S sedan; and production of new vehicles along with fixes for the recalled Roadsters, which numbered fewer than 500 vehicles.
Skeptics worry about how long it will take Tesla to generate more money than it spends on all of this in the name of the environmentally sound but still sweet ride.
Challenges to Tesla in the market are also varied, including other electric vehicles like the Nissan Leaf, and hybrids like the Porsche Cayenne S Hybrid.
Shortly after the smokey Roadster recall, PepsiCo Frito-Lay announced it would scale back the use of plant-based, biodegradable plastic packaging for SunChips due to complaints about the bags making noise.
All but one of the flavors of SunChips will now be sold in “traditional” plastic sacks instead of the non-petroleum, compostable stuff. That’s at least until the company comes up with or purchases another green alternative.
Back in April 2009, when Sun Chips introduced the biodegradable bags, the company ran extensive print, TV and digital advertising touting the green initiative (as MediaPost reported then). Now, PepsiCo Frito-Lay seems to blame the bags’ noise for the widely reported 11% sales decline in SunChips over the last 52 weeks.
Alexis Madrigal, a writer for The Atlantic went so far as to lament how much capital, human and otherwise, was invested in the SunChips sustainable packaging effort in the first place:
This is where we put our productive talents to work…The great machinery induced by billion dollar markets for everything (anything) can be reconfigured for any purpose, even something as mind numbing as flexible, lightweight chip containers.

Typical “flexible, lightweight chip container” materials — namely petroleum-based plastics — represent some 8% of the nation’s waste stream according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Other writers suggested that consumers should have tolerated the noise or poured their chips in a bowl if the idea of keeping petroleum-based (and quieter) plastics out of the waste stream mattered to them, really.
Will PepsiCo’s investors feel good about the company ditching the sad sacks in response to customers’ demands, or will they be inspired by the fact that PepsiCo Frito-Lay tried to actually do something game changing in the first place? Its stock price was dipping at the opening of the market on Thursday Oct. 7th following widespread media discussion about the bags. PepsiCo is, unlike Tesla Motors, such a massive global food and beverage business there’s a chance that SunChips’ sales didn’t even move the needle for investors.
Environmentalists will be watching both brands, hoping for improved sales and stock prices, and case studies that prove sustainable business can also be profitable and competitive, and these setbacks were just a price paid by pioneers.

955,Mom-commerce Site EcoMom Banks $1.1 Million,https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/06/mom-commerce-site-ecomom-banks-1-1-million/,2010/10/06,"Parenting focused ecommerce site EcoMom, which provides a curated shopping experience for moms, has just received $1.1 million in Series A funding from angels and VCs alike. Investors in the round include Dan Gould (founder of Newroo and Namesake), Cyan and Scott Banister, Dave McClure, Paige Craig, Sizhao Yang, Kima Ventures and David Pell as well as several angels from Angel List.
Like a Zappos for new parents, the six person company sells things to new moms keeping in mind the following strictures, “Are the products safe?” “Are the products useful?” 
Ecomom targets LOHAS or the “lifestyles, health and sustainability” market, which CEO Jody Sherman pegs at $200 billion a year. Says Sherman, “If given the opportunity every mom would make the decision to purchase a product that was healthier for their child or safer.”
Likening themselves to the Diapers.com “Green” section, or Amazon Babies, Sherman says there’s no service currently curating parenting products like EcoMom which, with a network of over 13,000 mommy bloggers (growing at about 100 per month) writing product reviews, aims to be the primary resource for parents shopping for their families. “I hope to one day be as big as Zappos,” says Sherman.
But while Zappos is focused on shoes, EcoMom provides a variety of products,  currently stocking an inventory of over 2000 childcare-related items in an attempt to apply the traditional ecommerce model to the social/content driven web.
This financing is a big deal for the bootstrapped startup, which went live last February and initially began with shipments of products on pallets to Sherman’s bedroom. While EcoMom is currently not-profitable, Sherman expects to be in the black before the end of next year, “This money will allow us to grow faster,” he says, planning on using the money for site redevelopment, key hires and acquiring new customers.
Update: Sherman informs us that EcoMom has had so much investor interest that the round ended up incorporating another additional 900K and new investors such as Google’s Don Dodge and Chamath Palihapitiya from Facebook. The round ended up closing with over $2 million in funding.

956,Silicon Valley at a Cross Roads: Entertainment or Science?,https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/05/silicon-valley-at-a-cross-roads-entertainment-or-science/,2010/10/05,"
I wrote a post Sunday about the difference between cultural waves in Silicon Valley and the individual companies that come out of them. Many of the individual companies survive but the wave itself always has to crash. That’s the nature of waves. But it’s also the nature of waves that another one always comes along. I have no idea what that will be. After all, the smartest people in the Valley thought social networking was a feature not a business ten years ago.
But it’s clear that the Valley is at a crossroads: Will it follow the Web 2.0 path further down the road of media and entertainment or go back to its roots of hardcore science and technology?
For a few decades, waves in Silicon Valley followed each other logically. Innovation in semiconductors lead to innovation in computers, which lead to innovation in software, both personal and enterprise. That lead to a desire to connect all that stuff via Ethernet, the Web, telecommunications and huge banks of servers, switches and routers. And on top of all of that we built the first wave of highly functional Web  companies– sites that used the technology the Valley had already built to enable us to to do things like buy a plane ticket way cheaper and way easier.
But in the early 2000s, the Valley was at a crossroads. Was the future cleantech or Web 2.0? Put another way, was the future starting a new stack or continuing to iterate on top of the mostly-built out one? The cleantech camp was championed by a lot of top Valley names– most famously John Doerr– who saw it as the most important way to change the world and an undeniably huge market that required real innovation. The Web 2.0 camp was championed largely by the PayPal Mafia’s angel investors like Reid Hoffman and Peter Thiel, and a handful of other angels and mentors like Marc Andreessen. Many of them prized the fact that Web companies were the opposite of cleantech: Thanks to decades of technology build out they were cheap and low-tech to start, utterly changing everything about these companies from the size of the exit you needed to have a good return to how quickly you could know if you had something or not.
Ultimately, Web 2.0 won the Valley’s heart and hype, and because of a few giants, it’ll likely win in sheer returns. There are a lot of explanations why. It could have just been the better opportunity for venture-style investing that typically shies away from funding big science projects. It could be because it was just the easier opportunity. It could be because the people holding the checkbooks were more excited by it. It could be because the government hasn’t done its part in funding more cleantech research, or because the government hasn’t done its part in creating subsidies to spur the early days of an alternative energy market. It could also be that there’s a cleantech equivalent of Facebook out there, it’s just taking longer to build and prove itself and we don’t know it yet. But one thing is pretty safe to say: Cleantech was the first huge market ripe for innovation in decades in which the Valley lost its leadership position. By almost any measure there are bigger markets for and innovation in cleantech happening elsewhere in the world.
A few keynotes and backstage conversations I  had at Disrupt last week emphasized that the Valley is at another cross roads. And it’s a more exaggerated version of the last: Between a return to companies based on real, disruptive science or further down the rabbit hole of Web-enabled media and entertainment.
Peter Thiel said it the most strikingly when he– the man who turned a $500,000 investment in Facebook into $3 billion and the man who believed the Web was still a great opportunity when few others did– said that the Internet as a category was dead from a venture capital standpoint. The next day, Vinod Khosla backed this up by mocking the idea that a conference called “Disrupt” would have a demo of Microsoft’s next version of Windows. Even Eric Schmidt got into the futurist act with all his longing for cars-that-drive-themselves. On the other side we had the group of startups in the middle of Monday’s afternoon of competitions that were all basically iterations on Foursquare. It’s one thing for companies to build off of the success of Facebook or the iPhone, but Foursquare hasn’t even proved it can go mainstream.
This is not a zero-sum game. Both waves will find funding– after all more money was put into cleantech than Web 2.0 in the mid-2000s. And it bears noting that the two waves are also inexorably intertwined. Yesterday I listened to a heady, science-filled keynote by Valley egg-head Steve Jurvetson of Draper Fisher Jurvetson, where he described innovation around energy and water as the first trillion-dollar opportunities VCs had ever seen. I asked him afterward how the Valley would do tackling them. Would we still dominate? The clear answer was no, but not because there is less innovation was coming out of the Valley. Instead, more innovation is just happening elsewhere, he said. And he added that a lot of the things people deride as not disruptive enough– particularly applications like Skype, Gmail, Facebook, Twitter– have played a huge role in knitting together tech elites around the world, making this surge in global disruption possible.
But one path will likely dominate the Valley zeitgeist, impact and returns over the next decade. You don’t see a cleantech movie do you?
I’d vote with Thiel and Khosla for science. There are a lot of amazing innovations brewing in fields like bionics, artificial intelligence, space travel, agriculture, energy and material science– some of which are largely made possible because of the build out of the computing stack. But my guess is most of the TechCrunch audience and many of my colleagues would pick the other route. A path where San Francisco becomes the center of Web media, the way New York was the center of news media and LA was the center for entertainment media. These businesses are easier to understand, quicker to evaluate and more likely to produce a series of newsy blog posts. I don’t say that as a value judgment– I wrote a book on Web 2.0. It’s as fun and sexy as the Valley gets, and it’s what a mass audience cares about.
The reason Silicon Valley has been so resilient in wave-after-wave is its ecosystem, and four main groups of that ecosystem will play their roles in determining which wave wins.
The first is the media. Writing about science isn’t easy, and it isn’t popular. Part of this is on us, but blogs are a community. Posts I’ve written on science and other off-the-beaten-track topics like innovation coming out of slums and villages in the developing world typically don’t drive the same traffic or engagement that a post about the latest YCombinator company does. If the page views aren’t there– will reporters who want to write about this stuff be supported?
The second are smart engineers and talented executives. Do they want to work at companies like these? Or do they want to aim for the next Facebook, Zynga, Groupon or Twitter– companies where you get the instant gratification of reaching millions of people and where increasingly you don’t have to wait for an IPO or acquisition to get a windfall?
The third is investors. That’s the one I’m least worried about. Hype about new media, super angels and flips aside, there are still billions of dollars in the Valley that has never had a big hit from the consumer Internet and would just as soon back something with proprietary science. And some of the Valley’s biggest names are getting behind companies like these whether they are superstar investors like Khosla and Thiel or superstar entrepreneurs like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and their bets on space travel.
Mostly it will depend on the fourth factor: The entrepreneurs. Ultimately that’s who we all revolve around. Call me an idealist, but I still believe in the core organizing structure that has made Silicon Valley what it is: Great, determined entrepreneurs disrupting a big market will get funded and the rest will follow– maybe not at Web speed, but it will follow nonetheless.

957,"IBM Releases CityOne, A ""Serious Game,"" For Urban Planners, Civic Leaders And Executives",https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/04/ibm-cityone-game/,2010/10/04,"
The idea of gaming for more than a high score and bragging rights has been around for some time. The U.S. military used flight simulators and Mission Rehearsal Exercise video games in training programs as early as 2001.
More recently, scientists at the University of Washington began using a game called FoldIt to solve problems related to molecular science and, as the title suggests, folding and design of proteins.
Today, IBM released CityOne (a “serious game” in the company’s own parlance) to help urban planners, civic and business leaders make cities “smarter” or more environmentally and socially sustainable. CityOne is a massively multiplayer online game in the real time strategy category.
According to a press statement from IBM CityOne entails:


…More than 100 real-world scenarios. [Players must] transform cities related to initiatives such as alternative energy, traffic management, water management , banking and retail supply chains through a series of crisis scenarios. In all of the missions, the user must determine the best way to balance the city’s financial, environmental and sociological interests.
Players make decisions to improve the city by attaining revenue and profit goals, increasing customers’ and citizens’ satisfaction, and making the environment greener with a limited budget.   In parallel, players will learn how the components of business process management, service reuse, cloud computing and collaborative technologies can make organizations in city systems more intelligent.

Predecessors in the popular SimCity and Civilization franchises got regular gamers (and educators) thinking about social and environmental issues years ago.
Worldchanging.com also offers an excellent list of articles on video games designed for social good and general audiences.
Joining IBM in the design of games for enterprise use, and online gaming that gets professionals thinking about sustainability issues, the Seattle startup, Novel Inc. released its own “social strategy MMO” in alpha earlier this year, Empire And State.

Self-described environmentalists demand or adopt technology that sounds promising without a sense of its true cost or impact to the environment. “Painting your roof white is better for the environment than driving a Prius or similar vehicle,” Khosla pointed out.
The green movement contrarian famously invested in a business that aims to make coal power cleaner (Calera) with carbon sequestration. The very notion displeases environmentalists who are concerned about the way coal is mined, as well as emissions from coal-burning plants.
Today, Khosla Ventures joined Sigma Partners investing a $13.7 million round in PVTSolar, a company that puts a new spin on solar power generation for home and light commercial use. PVT’s Echo system supplements typical photovoltaic solar panels with technology that captures the heat they generate to supply additional power.
Earlier in the week, a Khosla Ventures portfolio company Amyris — makers of non-petroleum fuels and chemicals — raised $85 million through an initial public offering (according to Fortune).
Khosla noted that Amyris came to him wanting to produce anti-malarial drugs. Six months later, after “playing around” with the company’s biotechnology, they were producing jet fuels. His fund made a $15.59 million investment in the business that’s now worth about $65.36 million.
The amounts of venture capital invested by Khosla may sound high to the uninitiated. But relative to clean tech deals struck by other funds, Khosla said his were 20% lower: “Our median series A investment is around $3 million. I don’t care what other VCs are doing. I’m telling you the facts of our business. The way we practice venture capital, we help entrepreneurs experiment with technology, take their crazy ideas, their best ideas, and then create a position where capital to get started becomes irrelevant.”

Joining Khosla on stage was General Electric’s Kevin Skillern, who heads up GE’s venture capital investments in clean energy. Skillern told TechCrunch immediately following the talk that GE is focused as much on creating and commercializing new technology, as it is on making installed, legacy systems more efficient. GE equipment produces 1/3 of the world’s power, and much of what’s already installed will be operating for more than another 10 years, he noted.
In contrast to Khosla, he believes that some clean tech startups — like those seeking large utilities as customers, and those who want to gain scale as quickly as possible to take advantage of government subsidies — simply do require more capital than startups in other sectors, like consumer web and entertainment, to get started. Khosla made the case that clean tech firms don’t have to be capital intensive compared to other tech startups.
Khosla Ventures invests in companies whose well-being is not dependent on government subsidies over time. “Subsidies can help technologies get started. But I don’t invest in anything that can’t achieve market competitiveness in five years. You should be able to achieve the price for a good that will sell in India or China without a subsidy in that time.”
Skillern and Khosla both called on Silicon Valley and corporate venture capitalists to think less about what Khosla called “nice features,” and more about truly disruptive businesses that will solve the world’s problems.

959,"Intuit, GE Executives Trade Notes On Innovation And Acquisitions",https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/27/ge-intuit-tcdisrupt-sf/,2010/09/27," 


Speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco today, Scott Cook, the founder and chairman of Intuit, and Beth Comstock, the chief of marketing and vice president of General Electric (GE) traded notes on innovation, investing and acquisitions.
Intuit’s best-known products include Turbo Tax, Quickbooks and Quicken, software that helps consumers, the owners of small and medium sized businesses and large financial institutions save or manage their money. The company’s more recent releases include the Intuit GoPayment mobile app and Mophie credit card reader, the latter of which began sales at Apple stores about three weeks ago, and Turbo Tax SnapTax, a mobile app which allows users to “snap, prepare and file” their taxes with a smart mobile device.

GE’s business encompasses: power generation from traditional and renewable sources, hybrid and electric vehicle technology, financial services, health care solutions, and television programming among others. The company recently committed to spend $10 billion on clean tech research and development in the next five years via its Ecomagination initiative. Ecomagination includes a business competition for smart grid technology startups.
Comstock said more competitions focused on specific clean tech and health concepts would likely follow (and would help build GE’s portfolio). GE is also investing, over a six year period that commenced in 2009, $6 billion in healthcare ideas and businesses that decrease costs, improve quality and increase global access to healthcare.
For Intuit, Cook said, acquisitions are part of an approach to innovation and growth that starts with growth from internal talent and resources. Over the long term, Intuit expects double-digit organic revenue growth and revenue growth that exceeds expense growth. Whether Cook is reviewing a business idea that was hatched internally, or was pitched from an external source, he doesn’t apply a rigid hurdle rate, he said:
We look for…the deep and abiding problem that consumers and small businesses have that has not been solved. [We ask if] we can cobble together technologies that will solve that problem, and delight people in doing so to build competitive advantage. If we can do business there, it doesn’t matter what’s on a spreadsheet.

In the last few years Intuit acquired Homestead, Paycycle, Mint.com (which launched at the TechCrunch 40 in 2007) and more recently, MedFusion. Intuit spends its cash on high-yield opportunities, targeting risk-adjusted returns of 15-20 percent, generally.
Of its acquisition of Mint.com and others, Cook said:

You either disrupt or you get disrupted. If you’re not engineering, and somebody else is, you gotta get on the bandwagon. We bet on them, they also bet on us. [After we acquired Mint] we gave them our Quicken business, and now they manage both! They’re bringing invigorating new thoughts there.

Comstock said that GE has a “hole in its pocket” now, where great clean tech and health ideas are concerned. She emphasized that the company has been more open of late, investing in promising startups through competitions and more, and striking joint ventures with companies that complement GE’s existing lines of business:
We have great battery technology relating to electric vehicles. Our lab is great at sodium science! So we’d created this battery, and we had to make them. Our marketing team then asked: what other markets can I take this to? Auxillary power for planes? Cell phone towers? That is like a virtual startup. It could make $200 million in the first couple of years. At the same time, we invested a couple of rounds in A123. They have lithium capabiltiites. We brought them into our R&D lab, and its the first time we’ve co-created like this. So now, we’re backing the A123 battery, too.

Comstock advised founders wanting to attract GE as an investor, buyer or partner:
We have a whole combo of things we’ve grown and invested in, both…We are always asking ‘Does it scale?’ All the time… Technology is the thing that we do. But business model innovations are really important, especially when you lok at the data that’s coming out of everything! Jet Engines. Medical [devices]. You name it. Don’t just think: ‘I have to have a thing.’ It’s also software, algorithms and business models that we haven’t had experience with that interest us.

Cook advised founders more generally:
Select your team very carefully. Get the right people on the bus and pick the very best for each slot. Have a mission, a big dream, go out and change the world. The big dreams make a difference. But get there one successful experiment at a time. If there’s something I’ve learned in the last 4 years, it’s the power of iteration. Rapidly create, test, change… Run experiments with customers, let the customer vote, don’t rely on the boss to vote.

960,"The All-Electric Coda Sedan, Made In California And China, Coming To U.S. Markets",https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/26/ev-coda-sedan-coming-to-us/,2010/09/26," A new electric vehicle, the Coda Sedan, is set to hit the streets stateside, starting in California in 2010 and expanding sales to Hawaii in 2011. In the U.S. the Coda Sedan is priced to compete with the Chevy Volt and Nissan Leaf at $44,900 before federal and state discounts or incentives.
Reports by Car And Driver revealed that the Coda Sedan is a four-door, five-seat, totally electric vehicle with a body and chassis licensed from Mitsubishi. The body and chassis will be modified and assembled in China then shipped to California for the installation of electrical systems.
The Coda Sedan’s lithium-iron phosphate battery and electric motor allow a top speed of 80 miles per hour. The battery should endure 2,000 recharges. The company plans to manufacture the batteries in Ohio, through Lio Energy Systems, a Coda Automotive exclusive joint venture with China’s Lishen Power Battery.
The New York Times’ Thomas L. Friedman reported this week:

…14,000 [Coda vehicles] will be on the road in California over the next year. [The car] can travel 100 miles on one overnight charge, is a combination of Chinese-made batteries and complex American-system electronics — all final-assembled in Oakland.

Kevin Czinger, the president and chief executive of Coda Automotive recently paraded it around Washington D.C., hoping to win the U.S. General Services Administration as a customer. In early September, the GSA announced its plans to: “reduce fleet petroleum consumption by 30 percent…and emissions from employee commuting and business travel by 25 percent” by the year 2020.
Coda Automotive has raised about $125 million in venture capital since 2007, and is raising more with the intention to go public next year.

961,Google Instant: Energy Saver or Sucker?,https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/24/google-instant-energy-saver-or-sucker/,2010/09/24,"
When Google Instant debuted on September 8th, the search company touted its efficiency. As TechCrunch has previously reported, Google Instant saves web users time by delivering results more quickly than other engines, and Google’s earlier search products. Marissa Mayer Google’s vice president of search products and user experience, estimates Google Instant could save a collective 350 million hours of search time over its first year.
But how will Google Instant impact the company’s own data centers, operations and energy efficiency? Does it increase network traffic and power consumption by an end users’ local PC, by the network or through additional processing by Google servers?
A Google spokesperson told TechCrunch:
It’s too soon for us to know exactly how this will impact our power consumption. Of course, as our business grows, we want to make sure we minimize our environmental impact. We’re taking every step we can to implement innovative and responsible environmental practices across Google to reduce our carbon footprint, ensure efficient computing and help our employees be green.

He also referred to pages at Google’s corporate website detailing the company’s efforts to become carbon neutral.
Google has increased its efforts to be environmentally responsible over the years. It has invested in renewable energy businesses, and committed to purchasing power from renewable sources for example.
Its products — Google Earth and Google Maps in particular — advance a wide range of environmental research. A couple of examples are the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s study of water and air quality around the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and the African Wildlife Foundation’s study of elephants and other conservation projects in the African Heartlands.
Google also took a pledge devised and promoted by the Climate Savers Computing Initiative, to cut the energy consumption of computers in half.
However, Google keeps details about its infrastructure and energy use secret, viewing them as a proprietary and competitive issue. Twitter, Facebook and other technology firms also conceal details about their data centers and energy consumption in aggregate for the same reasons. Regulated stock exchanges, and the U.S. government don’t compel internet service and IT companies to report more details about their environmental impact, today.
Green IT and sustainability researchers worry that the computing power required to run Google Instant makes the feature more of an energy sucker than an energy saver on balance.

The chief executive of 1E, a global green IT software and consulting firm, Sumir Karayi explains:
“At the base level Google is doing more processing up front [with Google Instant]. Because of that, it is highly unlikely that this solution itself could have any positive impact on the environment, or save energy costs for Google, even if it has a very positive impact on the productivity of the end-user.”
At the same time, Karayi also thinks Google Instant is “incredibly sensible.” With it, he says “Google is addressing one of the biggest areas of waste in IT, the amount of time PC users, and IT professionals waste on doing things that are not required and that can be automated. If you can save a few minutes or milliseconds, cumulatively, that amounts to a huge number of work minutes, even if these are not directly energy-saving or easily quantifiable.”
According to a comprehensive report by Energy Star (a joint program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy) data centers used 61 billion kWh of electricity in 2006, comprising 1.5% of the nation’s electricity consumption at the time, and costing approximately $4.5 billlion. Energy Star estimated that national energy consumption by servers and data centers would nearly double by 2011 to more than 100 billion kWh, representing a $7.4 billion annual electricity cost.
By setting new standards and offering new tools to measure and rate the efficiency of data centers and servers, the government agencies hope they will drive IT and internet service companies to voluntarily do things like calibrate their buildings, equipment and software, or use non-hydrocarbon energy sources to power their data centers, thereby curbing their negative environmental impact and those aforementioned electricity costs.

962,"SolarCity's CEO On What's Holding Back Solar Power In America: It's 50 Markets, Not One",https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/22/solarcitys-ceo-on-whats-holding-back-solar-power-in-america-its-50-markets-not-one/,2010/09/22,"
Solar City, a company that designs, installs and leases out solar systems to home and business owners announced that it will bring solar power to some 30 Wal-Mart stores in California and Arizona.
Wal-Mart operates more than 8,500 brick and mortar locations worldwide, and began adding renewable energy to operations, bit by bit, years ago. Since 2005, Wal-Mart has purchased wind-generated electricity from Duke Energy, solar power from Sun Edison and SunPower, and tested out hybrid and biofuel trucks within its fleets, also installing Bloom Energy biogas fuel cell system to power two stores in Southern California. Solar City plans to use thin-film solar technology at the Wal-Mart stores provided by Miasolé and First Solar.
The deal is representative of a global trend: increasing use and sales of clean energy, in particular from solar photovoltaics. According to research by SolarBuzz, the “PV” industry’s worldwide revenue increased by 154% year over year, hitting $17.2 billion for the second quarter of 2010, compared to $6.2 billion for the same period in 2009.
Chief executive and founder of Solar City, Lyndon Rive [pronounced like “five”] spoke with TechCrunch about helping Wal-Mart go greener, what his company looks for in solar technology providers, and why the United States is simply not a solar leader — yet.

Q: What does Solar City do? 
LR: We’ve had a clear road map since the inception of the company in 2006. We knew we needed to make solar as affordable as possible for as many people as possible, reducing barriers to adoption, and up front costs.
We design, finance and install [solar] photovoltaics systems at residential and commercial sites.  We don’t sell the systems to our customers. We own them. So, we are responsible for making sure that they can continue to produce power reliably and affordably for the next twenty-five years.
Our plans are aggressive, to double and triple every year. That gets harder, but we feel confident we can achieve that.
Q: How do you select the products you use in your solar projects? 
LR: Our vice president of product focuses on this much more than I do. But our criteria would include longevity and power first, then cost. To an extent, we rely on what manufacturers present to us. If they are adopting new, lower impact or zero impact materials, we will be able to adopt those, too. We look for suppliers who show leadership in terms of R&D, panel technology and more while meeting our basic criteria.
Q: What does working with Wal-Mart mean to your business? 
LR: Wal-Mart has many years of success and is known for being financially conscious in every way. Hopefully other brick and mortar retailers will look at their example, and say if Wal-Mart can use solar, we can do it too. The Wal-Mart stores we are working with are large in size. But many of the commercial systems we deliver are 100 to 200 kilowatts, meaning smaller systems. We can almost always save customers money from day one. Or we can at least get them energy at the same price that they would have paid for energy from hydrocarbon, non-renewable, polluting sources.
Q: What will happen to the photovoltaic systems that you install, once they are spent? 
LR: We intend to recycle everything we use. We haven’t been doing this yet, as most of our projects have been deployed within the past three to four years and are not yet at the end of their life.
First Solar [one of our suppliers] has an entire recycling program they have implemented to make this kind of thing possible. But the value chain that we address, and the research and development that we focus on is around delivery and financing.
We look at mounting equipment, process automation and building permits, the vehicles we use to run our fleet — we find and do everything we can in the most environmentally responsible way across the board to get solar installed and drive solar adoption. We ask things like: how do we reduce the travel time of our trucks? How do we do more at once during a site visit?
As far as the panel technology, all we can do there is influence. This is a global market, and as it gets bigger we hope we can also be more influential.
Q: You are venture-backed by huge clean tech investors including: Mayfield Fund, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, DBL Investors, Generation Investment Management LLP and Elon Musk. How have they impacted you most?
LR: At the end of 2008, there was this financial crisis. For the first quarter of 2009, if it wasn’t for the additional capital we’d raised we could not have grown. Today we’re doing really well. We’re cash flow positive. We’re hiring in every single area. It’s crazy! We’ve hired over 300 people in the last year. We’re over 760 employees.
Q: Why isn’t the U.S. viewed as a leader in solar today?
LR: The U.S. is not a leader in solar adoption in part because the U.S. is not one market. Germany is a single market. Same with Japan, Italy or France. You are dealing with a single market in each country. But in the U.S. you deal with fifty different markets.
States like California, Arizona and New Jersey have solar programs that vary widely. Other states don’t have anything in the way of a solar subsidy whatsoever. They are all operationally different. The variables make it difficult to achieve the scale you see in other more uniform markets.
Some states are 99% coal-powered, and that power is ultra low-priced. In some places, if you consume more power, if you are less efficient, you actually get a bulk discount. Don’t even get me started on this. It makes no sense. It’s a bonus for being the least efficient and for using one of the more air-polluting sources of energy!
Q: How could the U.S. become more of a solar industry leader? 
LR: One way we can become a leader in solar and clean energy in general is to put a tax on carbon. This would drive natural markets to look for the best, and cleanest sources of power, versus the apparently cheapest sources of power.
I look at other manufacturers. When a manufacturer pollutes, say in liquid form, they have to pay, they have fees and disposal requirements. If corporations that “manufacture” energy pollute the air, they must pay for this, take ownership and include it in their costs.
If the U.S. government would make facilities that pollute the air pay for their pollution, that will drive the adoption of clean power.
Q: What else could help the solar industry take off here? 
LR: People get fixated on the cost of solar power. The cost of solar power is only half the equation. The cost of financing solar [projects] is the other half of the equation. Actually, financing is probably more important. It’s really important that the cost of capital does not go up for the industry and for consumers.
The federal government should extend cash grants and tax credits for solar [specifically the Payments for Specified Energy Property in Lieu of Tax Credits part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]. Right now, the treasury department is considering the renewal of this program.
If it does not get extended…the supply of financing for solar projects will be limited which will increase the cost of capital and slow solar adoption.
We have the chance to take leadership in solar adoption here if we keep the programs running a while longer. You extend a cash grant program and you will see us become one of the leaders.

963,Sharp To Buy Solar Project Developer Recurrent Energy For Up To $305 Million,https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/22/sharp-recurrent-energy/,2010/09/22,"
Sharp is to acquire 100% of Recurrent Energy, a San Francisco-based independent power producer and developer of distributed solar projects, for up to $305 million in cash.
The acquisition is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year, provided authorities approve the transaction.
Sharp, Japan’s largest solar-panel maker, says it expects demand in the North American photovoltaic market to rise significantly due to an increase in the number of projects for power companies, hence the move.
Recurrent holds an approx. 2 GW project pipeline of solar power generation plants located in the U.S. and Canada, and is also developing business in other areas, including Europe.
With Recurrent, Sharp aims to become a total solution company in the photovoltaic field, extending from developing and producing solar cells and modules to developing and marketing power generation plants.
Recurrent Energy raised $75 million from PE firm Hudson Clean Energy Partners back in July 2008. Mohr Davidow Ventures is another investor.

964,A Tale Of Two VC Industries: The Web Versus Cleantech,https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/21/vc-web-versus-cleantech/,2010/09/21,"

Last week, venture capitalist Fred Wilson wrote a post pointing out that the VC industry is split in two: software-based businesses and everything else (specifically, “cleantech, biotech and other capital intensive businesses”).
Software businesses don’t require as much capital as they once did, and certainly not as much as cleantech or biotech.  In fact, I’d go so far to say that the main asset venture capitalists bring to the table for Web startups is no longer capital, but rather connections, advice, and deal-making prowess.  Whereas for greentech and biotech, the capital is still the most important thing they bring to the table.  Wilson concludes:
I don’t think you can make blanket statements about the VC business anymore. These two industries are very different from each other and will have very different business dynamics and risk and return characteristics going forward.
To get a snapshot of the capital going into these two different VC industries, we ran some numbers through CrunchBase to compare funding rounds for consumer Web and ecommerce startups versus cleantech companies.  The data in CrunchBase for cleantech companies is not nearly as complete as it is for Web startups, but the trends they highlight are instructive.  (If you work for a greentech company, please add or update your Crunchbase profile).
So far this year through the end of August, CrunchBase tracked $1.87 billion in cleantech venture financings versus $1.35 billion for consumer Web and ecommerce startups.  But CrrunchBase captured four times as many deals for Web startups than it did for cleantech.
What is even more interesting is that the amount of venture capital that went into Web companies actually went down 8 percent from the same period the year before (from $1.5 billion).  For cleantech, the venture dollars increased by a whopping 77 percent (from $1.1 billion).
When you look at the average deal size, the disparity becomes even larger.  The average size of a venture round for a Web startup during the period was $5.2 million.   The average size of a cleantech round was $30.7 million.  Those numbers are across all funding rounds (seed through series F).  Based on this snapshot, cleantech is nearly six times as capital intensive as the Web.
On the exit side of the funnel, of 32 Web startup acquisitions with reported deal values tracked by CrunchBase so far this year, the total in exits was $4 billion.  The comparable exit value for cleantech companies was $726 million, but that was only for four tracked companies.  When you look at the average exit value, it was $182 million for cleantech versus $63 million for Web. Remember, these are not ROI numbers since the exits were for different amounts invested earlier, but it gives a sense of money in versus money out for these sectors.
Again, our cleantech numbers are far from complete, but the data does illustrate how much more capital it takes to fund cleantech than Web startups.  And it also suggests anecdotally that cleantech exits on average are commensurately larger.  Although, we admittedly don’t have enough good data on cleantech exits to make any hard conclusions.

965,How We Doing on that Whole Sustainability Problem? Not too Well,https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/20/how-we-doing-on-that-whole-sustainability-problem-not-too-well/,2010/09/20,"
The best entrepreneurs build things out of their own experience. Maybe that’s why Silicon Valley hasn’t dominated clean tech the way it dominated IT and the Web.  We’re aware of the energy crisis, but it doesn’t really affect us enough to do much about it. Look at how companies run things in their own houses: A study showed that while nearly 80% of executives believe that sustainability is a business benefit in the long term, only 30% require their businesses run in a sustainable way.
Are we waiting on magic fairies to take care of this? Or maybe just entrepreneurs in the emerging world who see and struggle with the problem everyday. Usually being close to a globally threatening problem is bad, but sometimes it can be an advantage. To wit, more than 40% of investments in renewable energy took place in emerging markets in 2009– most likely because those are the countries that can’t continue to put the problems off.
The theme of this past week’s World Economic Forum “Summer Davos” conference was sustainability. Like a lot of Americans, when I hear the word “sustainability” I think climate change and alternative energy—not a bad topic for a conference held in China, just as it surpasses the United States in energy consumed, much of it coming from extremely dirty coal. But there are more pressing problems of sustainability in the emerging world, that in America we just don’t see.
The vividness of the problem is something I’ve seen up-close during some-forty weeks of reporting in emerging markets. In China bloody fights are breaking out for water. In India, cities and roadways are crumbling under a crush of people moving to cities that the infrastructure and social services cannot support. And in Africa, fertile countries still struggle to feed their populations. These are problems most Americans know are out there, but we don’t think about them, because we’re not faced with them. Would someone who’s never used the Internet be able to build a competitive new browser? Probably not. That’s why my money (figuratively, because as a reporter I have no money) is on the emerging world to solve these big—and potentially lucrative—problems.
Some stats and commentary I heard at the Forum last week that have me thinking about this long after I left China and my jetlag has subsided:


Just how bad the water situation is. Lack of access to clean, safe drinking water plagues nearly 2.5 billion of the 6.9 billion people on earth, and the situation will only get more dire as the world population expands to 9 billion by 2050. At the World Economic Forum meeting, the global water crisis was talked about almost more than the energy crisis. “Water is the new oil,” said one CEO. Much of the story is about the waste of water. A sad fact I learned: The US is indirectly the number one exporter of water because we use it so heavily and wastefully in our food production.



We’re not talking about shortages; we’re talking about management systems. There’s more than enough water on the planet, the sun provides two times our energy needs if sourced and stored properly (a massive if) and there’s plenty of food to go around. It’s all about how we route it. Smart grids could reduce emissions by 2.2 gigatons per year. The world’s best energy companies are likely going to turn into software companies. This is an opportunity made for systems and software geniuses of Silicon Valley, particularly the enterprise software and supply chain crew markets that have mostly been in a slump for the last ten years. This is actually good news, because it’s a solvable problem through software and logistics. That we can build. New sources of water and fossil fuels? Not so much.



So much for that American ideal of “urban flight.” Half of the world’s population lives in cities right now, but in the next forty years that will increase to 70%. For China and India that means more than 800 million people will be moving to cities by 2050. I heard few answers on the plight of emerging market urbanization, and I still think this is one of the biggest problems the world faces. The panel on sustainable cities was one of the more disappointing. Public transportation seems the best answer to de-clogging roadways, but that doesn’t solve the aspirational needs of people who want cars, nor does it answer how poor countries get the funding to build these systems. Already in China there are traffic jams that last days, and a small percentage of migrating urbanites have vehicles. In India the urbanization is messier, with millions moving to the cities in hopes of a better life and falling off the grid, living in slums, toiling in the informal economy with no way out. Problems of sanitation, air quality, water quality and energy all get compounded as the problem grows.



A huge question is whether access and affordability can go hand in hand when it comes to energy, water and food. We can engineer solutions, but can the people who need them most afford them? Several experiments around the emerging world have proven you don’t necessarily need huge budgets to solve these problems just willingness to experiment and innovate. Sometimes working within constraints forces the most elegant solutions to a problem. One panelist at Davos spoke of a program in the Middle East where the Dead Sea was desalinized, using that salt to salinize the Red Sea and generating energy during the process that could be used elsewhere. In Rwanda, private companies are extracting dangerous methane from the bottom of an “exploding lake” turning a potential natural disaster into something that can potentially power the tiny country for forty years. In India, I visited a tiny village called Hiware Bazar that has turned itself from a drought ridden wasteland to a lush, clean oasis in the middle of nowhere that sells its produce at a brand-premium and boasts more than fifty rupee millionaires. There was no one secret for Hiware Bazar’s success, rather decades of experimenting with various techniques to make the most of the rain they got, save it and allocate it more wisely.



With a problem that has dire consequences for private sector economies, national governments and local governments, it seems a lot of the stalling on the solutions are centered around deciding whose job is what. Along these lines, there’s a lot of debate about the role of government subsidies. Most governments and private sector leaders at the Forum felt they were essential, but one man phrased it best when he said the trick was making sure subsidies were a “feeding bottle” not an “addiction.”



Electric car production is forecast to reach one million vehicles in the next four years and Asia is on pace to do more than Europe and North America combined. There’s some debate about whether that’s the right solution, given that those cars are powered by the same dirty coal plants. Energy experts at the forum said those arguments were a straw-man, and if cars can charge during off-peak night time hours billions of cars can recharge without the need to build a single new plant.


Aside from building new management and software systems for water, food and energy, there’s a lot of room for company building and innovation on the product end. Designing products that use sustainability as a feature, not a problem to be solved. The example that jumps to mind is VNL, the solar-powered base station company I wrote about during my last trip to India. By making the base stations cheap enough that mobile operators could still make money of people who can’t pay $6 a month for service, the company solved a lot of the other problems base stations have. For instance, there’s no maintenance cost, because it’s simple enough that it can be installed by illiterate villagers. And the simplicity also means it needs less power, so it can run on just one solar panel. Sometimes it’s about under-engineering to solve these root problems, not over-engineering.

When you are talking about remaking the way we get the basic building blocks of life– and learn to share them with the 9 billion people that will be on the planet by 2050–it’s clearly not an issue for just government or just large incumbent companies or just entrepreneurs, any more than it is an issue for just Western developed countries, or just smoggy emerging markets. To have any optimism that all these groups can work in concert to solve these big of problems you have to either be a big believer in the goodness of humanity or a big believer in the power of long-term business greed to motivate short-term actions. I respect the World Economic Forum for pulling together so many powerful people to spend a week in China discussing the nuances of these issues, but I can’t say I left hugely optimistic on either count. Like an alcoholic, I fear the world hasn’t hit rock-bottom on its wasteful resources addiction yet.

According to a new SEC filing, Rhode Island startup GreenBytes Inc. added $3.5 million to the series A round they raised last year, led by Battery Ventures and initially consisted of $7.5 million.
GreenBytes provides “energy-efficient, inline deduplication storage appliances.” In plainer English, the company makes hardware and software that IT operations teams use to store and protect huge amounts of data, and to control how much energy they must use to do so. GreenBytes claims its technology can cut storage power consumption by 50%.
The company was founded in 2007 by Robert Petrocelli, who previously started and grew a medical information services firm, HeartLab, that was acquired by Agfa in 2005 for $132.5 million.
Investor Sunil Dhaliwal, a general partner at Battery Ventures in Boston who holds a board position at GreenBytes, said of this additional series A investment: “The company has seen strong growth in customers and revenue in the past few quarters.  We elected to do a small internal round to maintain momentum rather than spending time with external investors at a critical time.”
The company recently escaped a legal threat from Sun, now part of Oracle, and NetApp as did several other companies whose products and services used Zettabyte File System technology, according to reports by Chris Mellor at The Register.
GreenBytes plans to raise a B-round in the next year.

967,"Greenpeace Slams Zuckerberg For Making Facebook A ""So Coal Network"" (Video)",https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/16/greenpeace-slams-zuckerberg-for-making-facebook-a-so-coal-network-video/,2010/09/16,"
Environmental organization Greenpeace has released a video harshly criticizing Facebook’s use of coal-fuelled electricity in its Oregon-based data center, singling out founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The organization calls Facebook a “so coal network”.

Greenpeace’s Executive Director, Kumi Naidoo, had earlier expressed his concern with the Oregon data center in an open letter to Zuckerberg, kicking off a campaign – on Facebook – to create awareness for the company’s use of “dirty energy”.

The Facebook group attracted over 600,000 people, which Greenpeace says all call for the social network company to seek renewable energy and look for places that have an abundance of fresh, sustainable options for its data center(s).
Facebook’s director of policy communications, Barry Schnitt, elaborately responded to the letter (see comments), pointing out the company does what it can to safeguard the environment as much as possible.
Some choice quotes from his response:

“It’s true that the local utility for the region we chose, Pacific Power, has an energy mix that is weighted slightly more toward coal than the national average (58% vs. about 50%). However, the efficiency we are able to achieve because of the climate of the region minimizes our overall carbon footprint.”
“At the same time, it is simply untrue to say that we chose coal as a source of power. The suggestions of “choosing coal” ignores the fact that there is no such thing as a coal-powered data center.”

Schnitt also subtly points out Greenpeace’s own infrastructure challenges. The organization runs a number of servers in a rented data center in Northern Virginia, which in turns runs 46% on – you guessed it – coal.
The back-and-forth continued, with Greenpeace responding to Schnitt’s statements and saying Facebook should wield its power to demand more renewable energy resources where it’s building its data center.
They also point out companies like Google and Yahoo are doing a far better job.
And now there’s the video, embedded above, which in my opinion focuses far too strongly on Zuckerberg as a person and boasts some obviously flawed assumptions about his past and present thinking. I mean, what’s the point of making fun of him for being a “nerd”?
There’s nothing green or peaceful about ad hominem attacks if you ask me.
The timing of the video’s release is likely not coincidental, either, as it comes just a week before the premiere of The Social Network – a film written by The West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin about the origins of Facebook (which also features a lot of fiction).
In short, while I applaud much of what Greenpeace is doing as an organization, I’m not entirely sure releasing this type of video now is the right way of building a constructive relationship with Facebook, which in my mind would be far more beneficial for both.

Grid2Home, a “smart grid” technology startup in San Diego, obtained a round of seed funding from Granite Ventures, the company announced today. Grid2Home’s software and solutions enable smart appliances, energy meters, electric vehicles and the like to communicate with power systems, and thereby operate more energy efficiently.
Grid2Home’s “communication protocol stack” and software can, for example, let home owners switch between different energy types that they’d like to use, relying on power generated by a rooftop solar installation to heat a pool in most instances, but changing to power from the utility if solar cells are depleted, or power from the utility is within a certain price range.
With the funding from Granite Ventures, Grid2Home also announced the appointment Rick Kornfeld as chief executive and president, and Doug Rasor as chairman of the board.

970,SG Biofuels Cultivates $9.4 Million Series A Investment,https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/14/sg-biofuels-9-4-seriesa/,2010/09/14,"
San Diego-based SG Biofuels secured a series A investment of $9.4 million led by two privately held companies involved in the development of renewable energy, chemicals and biotechnology, Flint Hills Resources in Kansas, and Life Technologies Corporation in Carlsbad, Calif.
SG Biofuels catalogs, develops and produces seeds for a crop called jatropha, which is a drought-resistant plant used to make biodiesel, jet fuel, soaps, organic fertilizers, medicines and pesticides.
Two United Nations agencies (the Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Fund for Agricultural Development) reported in July that jatropha seeds “can be processed into lower-polluting biodiesel than fossil diesel to provide light and cooking fuel for poor rural families… [and] seed cake, a by-product from this process, can be used as fertilizer and animal feed after detoxification.”
Because some other biofuel crops — like corn, soy or sugar cane — could be used for food, jatropha is frequently regarded by environmentalists as a more favorable potential source of biofuels. Yet the crop is not without controversy. Jon R. Luoma wrote last year in e360, a publication from the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies:
“Whether jatropha will turn out to be the wonder plant it was originally touted to be will depend a great deal on how and where it is grown — an issue that must be resolved by scientists, businesses, and governments.”

Jatropha plantations displaced food crops in the Philippines, and in order to cultivate jatropha, forestry groups in India drained rice fields and reclassified public land where rural farmers had previously been able to let their livestock graze, Luoma reported.
SG Biofuels says its “crop improvement platform” has doubled the yield of jatropha, while reducing input costs for growers.

971,"Proud Americans, Solvin' The World's Problems",https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/08/proud-americans-solvin-the-worlds-problems/,2010/09/08,"

When the World Economic Forum reaches out to the world and asks people to talk about resource sustainability, energy efficiency and carbon emissions, they expect serious, thoughtful answer. And for the most part they get them.
Americans, of course, have to add a little flair. And so I’m not surprised to see a whole series of super hero interviews where they talk about these important issues, filmed in Venice Beach. The funny thing is that the answers are pretty good if you don’t watch the actual video and just listen to the audio. Boba Fett and Iron Man really nailed it with thoughtful answers in my opinion.
And it’s nice to see the very conservative WEF take a lighthearted approach to this. They even featured the video on their blog and will show it at next week’s summit in China. Our own Sarah Lacy will be there covering the event.

973,Does Apple Value Secrecy More Than The Environment?,https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/04/apple-secrecy-environment/,2010/09/04,"

According to new research from Pew Internet, 82% of American adults own a cell phone, Blackberry, iPhone or other similar devices. And 65% of adults who own them say they have slept with their cell phones on or right next to their beds.
Yet consumers don’t know what these devices are made of exactly, and what their environmental and health impact may be. Phone manufacturers aren’t required to share all the details. Some do anyway.
Not Apple, though. The company is keeping secrets as usual, this time from O2 EcoRatings the UK-based initiative to rank the most and least environmentally sustainable mobile phones.
Nokia, HTC, Samsung, LG, Palm and Sony Ericsson participated in the O2 EcoRatings. And RIM committed to participate in the next year of the study. The ratings, released last week, found the Sony Ericsson Elm the most environmentally friendly phone.
Was Apple justified in blowing off the outside, environmental inquiry about the iPhone? After all, new environmental reports, labels and certifications come out every couple of weeks.
Recently, the EPA proposed a new vehicle efficiency rating, and a new partnership called the ULE-880 kicked off ratings of manufacturers.

The sheer volume makes it hard for companies and consumers to know which reports are credible and scientific, or just public relations fluff.
Jennifer Woofter, founder and president of Strategic Sustainability Consulting near Washington D.C. believes the O2 EcoRatings are credible, though. Woofter’s company helps manufacturers get their products, operations and environmental reporting up to the specifications of retailers like Wal-Mart.
By declining to participate in environmental ratings by trustworthy outside agencies, Woofter says “[Apple] isn’t taking a leadership position when it comes to sustainability. And it risks looking like a company that doesn’t take feedback well.” She believes that Apple’s own environmental audits are not yet done in a consistent manner, or with clear enough criteria to appease legitimate concerns.
Environmental researchers still want Apple to answer some questions publicly like: are the materials in its devices obtained from conflict-free mines? What toxins, if any, are still in those iPhones and chargers? With what standards and regularity does Apple review its original equipment manufacturing partners to make sure they are operating in an environmentally and socially responsible way? How will the company curb e-waste?

Continued secrecy should not surprise those familiar with Apple’s corporate ways. Earlier this year, the company shot down two shareholder proposals asking it to do more rigorous reporting.
Apple rarely acquires other companies, preferring to innovate from within, which also happens to minimize its exposure to outsiders like a target company’s attorneys, accountants or advisers.
One of the firms that developed O2 EcoRatings Telefónica O2 UK is not a total stranger to Apple, but a major mobile carrier and retailer that sells the Apple iPhone in Europe. The other, Forum For the Future, is an independent non-profit that promotes “sustainable development” and studies the impact of various industries on people and the planet.
Woofter (who is not affiliated with either) lauded them for: making their ratings criteria clear and non-proprietary;  examining metrics like energy use and materials in the phones; and looking at the sources of these materials, and conditions for workers all along the supply chain. “Sustainability is not just about carbon,” she says.
In the past, Apple has allowed a number of its personal computers and laptops to be rated by a US-based environmental reporting non-profit, the Green Electronics Council, which created the highly influential Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool, or EPEAT standards. Its products received stellar EPEAT ratings, “Gold” level across the board.
Opening up about its computers helped Apple win some respect from (and quiet down) Greenpeace; the environmental activists launched a massive campaign criticizing Apple in 2007. Allowing the iPhone to be independently rated and compared to peers’ devices could make the company look good and green anew. So why would Apple still decline?

Chris Pinney, the director of research and policy at Boston College’s Center for Corporate Citizenship suggests it’s because they just don’t have to talk. “Apple has a comprehensive supplier code and auditing program. They may feel their [own reporting] is sufficient to deal with ‘green’ issues.  They may also feel they have nothing to gain by joining a new, ‘eco-rating’ initiative in a market where they are a dominant player,” he says.
Pinney believes real change and less secrecy will be driven by government standards and by large carriers and retailers like Wal-Mart as they demand more labeling on the products they handle due to consumer pressure.
For now, an Apple spokesperson declined to comment on O2 EcoRatings. She pointed to  the “environment” pages of Apple’s website, and emphasized that the company restricts more toxins than the European RoHS Directive, which limits the use of hazardous substances in electronics and is considered progressive today.
Customers can bring most iPhones and iPods (not including the shuffle) to Apple retail stores for recycling, she said. For returned iPods, they get a 10% discount on a new iPod. The company hasn’t created a similarly motivating program for its iPads, iPhones, batteries, chargers or laptops, though.

Apple’s retail employees aren’t required to inform customers about responsible e-waste disposal, or available take-back and recycling programs.
Environmental responsibility is a theme largely absent from Apple’s hype events, too. Nobody from Apple’s top ranks talked about green features or e-waste recycling as they rolled out a new lineup of media devices last week.
Contrarily, Apple has been lauded for being accidentally and overtly green: their iPods and iTunes store have displaced tons of waste from compact discs. They’ve also been designing more energy-efficient products using less toxic material, and minimizing packaging over time. They’ve applied for patents to include solar cells in their portable devices. And a host of iPhone apps are meant to help consumers lead “greener” lives.
Still, if you found out your new iPhone was full of conflict minerals would you keep it? Or if it contained cancer-causing toxins, would you still sleep with it?

974,"Fast Trains to Connect US Cities, Alleviate Highway Congestion",https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/03/fast-trains-less-traffic/,2010/09/03,"
The Obama administration back in January promised $8 billion in funding for cities and states to build high-speed, intercity rail projects.
This week, the Department of Transporation issued its specifications for the manufacture of new fast trains, namely double-decker coach, dining, baggage, and business class passenger rail cars that can travel between 79 MPH and up to 220 MPH.
Bi-level rail cars not typical in the US today, would accommodate more passengers, and hopefully alleviate congested roads and some resulting air pollution.
According to the American Association of State Highway & Transportation Officials (AASHTO) 95 percent of passenger travel in America is made by car, motorcycle and truck on our highways now.
Expanding highway capacity and overhauling busted roads with more durable and sustainable materials can prevent some traffic jams. But even highway professionals advocate building efficient, intercity, high speed trains and upgrading our freight rail systems.
Wireless companies like Groundlink and D-Link could win business rigging new high speed trains with internet service and related equipment.
Cities that recently won government funding for their high speed passenger rail projects include: Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati, Ohio, and Battle Creek, Michigan among others along the Detroit to Chicago route.
Feds promised the biggest piece of the budget in their national high speed rail transit program earlier this year to large-scale efforts in Florida and California that would connect Tampa and Orlando with 168 MPH trains, and Los Angeles and San Francisco with trains running up to 200 MPH.

976,Five Greentech Startups Thinking Outside The Box,https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/27/five-greentech-startups/,2010/08/27,"The busy green tech industry is teeming with companies focused on alternative energy. Some of the biggest new sources of energy they are trying to tap into include solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, biomass and fuel cells. Most companies harnessing each power source are pursuing somewhat similar technologies – such as photovoltaic cells in solar, turbines in wind and hydroelectric – and then innovate from there.
There are also many companies, however, that also focus on green technology and alternative energy but in different ways. Here are five you may not have heard of that are worth keeping an eye on.  They are developing new ways to capture and store energy, light up our world, and power our vehicles.
New Energy Technologies
New Energy Technologies has two interesting projects under development: Motion Power and Solar Window. Motion Power aims to harness lost inertia from braking cars at places like toll booths, drive-thrus and traffic lights. The company is backed by the stealthy Quercus Trust, a VC and investment firm that focuses primarily on green tech.
The technology sits on the road where drivers often brake. As a car passes over the device, it pushes down mechanical treadles, allowing the device to help slow down its momentum and harvest some of its kinetic energy in the process. The company calls this an “external regenerative brake” that can convert wasted energy that usually turns into brake heat into electricity that can be used to power road signs, street lights and emergency power storage systems.
According to the company’s calculations, capturing kinetic energy one time a day from the approximately 6,000,000 trucks and 250,000,000 cars on U.S. roads could produce enough electricity to power 250,000 homes.
New Energy Technologies is also experimenting with solar energy. Its Solar Window is being developed to spray ordinary glass with solar cells that can turn windows into small-scale energy producers. Many photovoltaic cells require metal to help conduct energy, but New Energy Technologies has developed a prototype that uses transparent compounds to serve the same function. Unlike most solar films, which require high temperatures to be applied, the spray can be used at room temperature.
Lilliputian Systems
Lilliputian Systems, as the name implies, is concerned with making big changes using tiny technology in consumer electronics such as phones and laptops. The company was born in MIT’s Microsystems Technology Lab and hopes to replace lithium-ion batteries with miniature fuel cells. The cells will be powered by butane and sit on a chip to power a device.
The device produces electricity by converting the butane into carbon monoxide and hydrogen. When the two are exposed to air and electrolytes, it turns into electricity, keeping your gadgets powered indefinitely. The process’ byproducts are water vapor and carbon dioxide. The company claims the fuel cells are safe, and has convinced the Federal Aviation Administration of this enough to approve the use of Lilliputian fuel cells on airplanes.
The company claims the generators will be six times more efficient than electronics that require a wall charger. Lilliputian is backed by more than $90 million from investors that include Atlas Ventures, Kleiner Perkins and Rockport Capital.
Beacon Power
Beacon Power is focused not on energy production, but on energy storage. Like Lilliputian, Beacon thinks it can do better than existing battery technologies, and uses flywheels to store energy for later use.
Flywheels are like mechanical batteries, turning electricity into kinetic energy that keeps a wheel spinning inside a vacuum chamber until the energy is needed again. When this happens, the flywheel spins more slowly and electricity flows back out of the device. The company claims its flywheel chambers can be used for years with minimal maintenance and, unlike batteries, their storage capacity remains stable over time.
The U.S. Department of Energy has funded Beacon several times and says the company’s flywheels are up to ten times faster at responding to grid frequency changes than energy sources powered by fossil fuels. The company recently began building a 20-megawatt capacity energy storage plant in Stephentown, NY.
Topanga Technologies
Topanga is working on developing high-efficiency lighting whose color quality, output and longevity are better than those of LEDs, halogens and fluorescents.
The company produces plasma lights in warm, cool and white temperatures, and aims to brighten the commercial sector, selling to cities, large companies and building managers. By Topanga’s estimates, most fixtures pay for themselves in savings within three years and require very little maintenance.
Each lamp has an estimated lifespan of about 50,000 hours, or about 10 years. This is equal to the lifespan of most LEDs, and significantly higher than CFLs’ 12,000-hour and halogen’s 3,000-hour lifespans.
These plasma lights can be dimmed down to 20% of their maximum brightness and can give off up to 130 lumens per watt. The company is backed by investors that include Khosla Ventures and Nth Power.
Xtreme Green
Xtreme Green makes electric sports vehicles, including motorcycles, scooters and ATVs, with snowmobiles, and electric watercraft like jet skis under development. The company also produces curb-jumping three-wheeled patrol vehicles and motorcycles for police forces.
Although the company is best known for its X Rider electric motorcycle, its recreational vehicle line makes it somewhat unique in the electric vehicle space.
As environmental concerns about emissions grow, more lakes and wildlife areas no longer permit gas engines on the water. Xtreme Green’s watercraft are usually permitted, however. The company’s Jetboard runs on lithium batteries that let you play on the water for nearly two hours.

977,MIT's Solar-Powered Robot Prototype Ready To Swarm Upon Oil Spills,https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/26/mit-seaswarm-oil-spill-cleanup-robot/,2010/08/26,"MIT researchers tested the first prototype of the Seaswarm, a pack of robots that use nanotechnology to suck up oil from the surface of the ocean for immediate processing.
When completed, the robots will be able to travel along oil-spilled waters, collecting oil more cheaply and efficiently than oil skimmers. The robots are large: 16 feet in length and seven feet in width. They push a conveyor belt wrapped by an oil-absorbing nanowire mesh that repels water while slurping up to twenty times its weight in oil.
Once the robot is full, the material can be heated up to remove the oil and sent back into the waters to collect more. MIT’s SENSEable City Lab Associate Director Assaf Biderman likens it to a “rolling carpet” that could be able to clean for weeks on end in the right conditions. The robots are powered by solar panels and need only 100 watts of electricity to operate.
Seaswarm’s name refers to how a team of robots behave when they’re sent out on a mission together. The robots communicate wirelessly with one another and use GPS to sense where other robots in the fleet are working. This lets them spread evenly to clean the spill with more precision. The robots can also detect the edge of the spill and work their way inward.
This video explains how the robots clean up oil and collaborate with one other:

Researchers estimate that 5,000 robots could clean a spill as large as the one in the gulf in a month. The group plans to enter its developments to the X Prize competition for oil cleanup.
The prototype comes after months of development. Researchers planned to present Seaswarm at the TEDxOilSpill conference, but were apparently stopped last-minute due to an “unresolved intellectual property dispute at MIT.”
Another group of researchers at Texas Tech has been working on a similar oil-absorbing material we mentioned before as a solution to oil spill cleanup.
We can hope there will be no future oil spills, but in case there are, the Seaswarm could offer hope for a quicker cleanup.

It plans to use the capital to take its flourescent and LED lighting control systems — which are like dimmers on steroids and smart pills — from small to mid-sized commercial sites such as schools, courthouses and stores, to large scale commercial and industrial sites.
It will especially seek projects in “energy intensive” regions where the power supply may be limited, or strained by harsh weather for example.
Lumenergi’s systems were designed to help office and home owners to monitor, report on and optimize or reduce their use of energy for building wide lighting.
Some of Lumenergi’s systems make use of lower-power consuming LED lights. Others work with flourescents according to GreenTechMedia.
Flourescents are the most widely used lighting systems in U.S. office buildings today, according to research by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

979,GE Counting On Energy Monitoring And Solar To Cut Home Energy Usage By 70%,https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/24/ge-energy-monitoring-solar/,2010/08/24,"In an effort to push the limits of home energy efficiency, General Electric is partnering with the U.S. Department of Energy on a $5 million project to connect homes in the Western U.S. to its energy management system, LED lights, appliances and solar panels.
The purpose of the project is to research home energy efficiency and test new tracking systems. GE thinks participants will be able to save 70% on their electricity bills: 30% by monitoring and adjusting their energy usage, and 40% by installing solar panels. An average home in the U.S. pays $1,240 a year for its electricity, and GE believes the program could cut this sum by $850. Normally, these types of green energy upgrades take a number of years to pay for themselves.
The program will be implemented in the western U.S., including the cities of Phoenix, Sacramento and San Diego. Each participating house will be equipped with solar panels, energy-efficient appliances, LED lights and one of GE’s Nucleus home energy management systems to rule them all.
The Nucleus will let homeowners track their home energy use and make adjustments based on what they see. GE will also assess the energy usage of neighborhoods participating in the project. The device stores energy usage data and communicates with a smart meter. It can track a home’s thermostat and any other network-enabled appliances and gadgets.
Additionally, an online dashboard provided by GE will display the home’s real-time and previous energy usage, letting people identify high-energy culprits and see exactly how much effect switching them off or using them off-peak may have. GE plans to make the system accessible from a mobile device as well.
The project will also compare the efficiency and clean power production of newly constructed and older homes. According to the DOE, residential buildings suck up 38% of the nation’s electricity. Older buildings tend to consume more energy because they are often poorly insulated, leak air, contain inefficient appliances and use incandescent lights.

980,Self-Cleaning Solar Panels Could Boost Efficiency,https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/23/self-cleaning-solarpanels-could-boost-solar-efficiency/,2010/08/23,"The $24 billion solar panel market could use a good dusting. The benefits of solar energy are well-known, but what’s rarely mentioned is its nemesis: dust. Even a little bit—one-seventh of an ounce per square yard—can weaken a panel’s power conversion by 40%.
To tackle the problem, scientists looked to Mars, where similar technology was developed for space missions to the planet. NASA, along with Boston University, originally developed the self-cleaning technology for its Mars missions, to battle the planet’s red dust. Some of the rovers and other vehicles are solar-powered, and the self-cleaning coating on their solar panels helps them explore more effectively.
The technology, which has yet to be commercialized, consists of a clear coating with dust-monitoring sensors. The sensors send an electric charge into the coating when too much dust accumulates, and the coating creates a short blast of electricity to knock dust off the edges of the panels with minimal energy use. Scientists say close to 90% of the dust can be eliminated within two minutes every time dust piles up too high.
Coating the surface of solar cells could increase their efficiency and reduce maintenance costs, especially for large-scale installations. The installation is relatively simple, and doesn’t require any mechanical movement or water to dust the panels.
Self-cleaning solar panels would be especially effective in large installations, which are not only enormous, but often remote. The desert environments where many of these installations reside often challenge the panels with dust storms and little rain. Globally, the number of panels installed between 2003 and 2008 grew by 50%, and in the foreseeable future, the growth rate is expected to increase about 25% annually.

981,Rotating Solar House Generates Five Times The Energy It Consumes,https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/20/rotating-solar-house-generates-five-times-the-energy-it-consumes/,2010/08/20,"
What’s cooler than a rotating house? One whose solar panels produce five times the energy the house uses. That’s pretty incredible, considering that even zero-energy structures are rare.
German architect Rolf Disch built the home, called Heliotrope, to follow the sun throughout the day. The structure features triple panes of thermally insulated glass to strike a balance between letting light in and keeping the house cooler inside.
A giant 6.6-kilowatt-capacity rooftop solar panel called the Sun Sail slurps up the rays of energy, pumping them into the home and grid. Solar thermal collectors on balcony railings act as water heaters and radiators. On cloudy days, the house can be heated with wood chips and solar thermal heating.
The Sun Sail itself rotates separately from the house, adjusting itself to the best possible position at all times. This gives it a 30% to 40% advantage in energy production over traditional rooftop solar panels.
The house is green inside as well. Waste water goes through a purification system for reuse, and rain water collects in a rooftop basin. The toilet system turns human waste into compost.
Is it nice to live in? Disch must think so, as he resides in the prototype himself. Two other Heliotropes have been built to date, each costing about $2 million to build.
This video tours the house inside and out. Be warned: it’s in German and the time lapse at the beginning is set to some rocking techno music:

982,New Yeast With High Alcohol Tolerance Could Improve Biofuel Production,https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/20/alcohol-tolerant-yeast-biofuel/,2010/08/20,"
At the intriguing intersection of green tech and microbial genomics lies a new discovery that could make biofuel production more efficient and affordable. That discovery is a strain of yeast with above-average alcohol tolerance.
Biofuels are made by fermenting crops, and when yeast is used to convert sugars into biomass, the fermentation can create familiar alcohol-based fuels like ethanol and isobutanol.
Here’s the catch: if the fuel is too concentrated, the yeast begins to die. It would be more efficient to be able to produce highly concentrated batches, however.  So University of Illinois Professor Yong-Su Jin set out to find a gene in yeast that can help it tolerate more alcohol.
Jin studied the microbe most commonly used in ethanol production, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and found not one, but four genes that boost yeast’s tolerance to ethanol and isobutanol.
Now the challenge will be to breed yeast with these genes over-expressed. One of the genes in particular, INO1, increased tolerance by 340% and could help produce up to 70% more ethanol per batch.
It might not be as simple as it sounds though, since other genetic elements could interact with the identified genes in a way that hasn’t yet been tested. Still, it’s a discovery that could significantly improve biofuel production in the future, especially as scientists begin to breed yeast with this knowledge.

983,Study Shows People Are Clueless About Energy Savings – Here's What Actually Works.,https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/18/study-shows-people-are-clueless-about-energy-savings-heres-what-actually-works/,2010/08/18,"Quick, name one of the best things you can do to save energy at home. If you said “turning off the lights,” you’d be wrong.  But you are not alone, most Americans say the same thing.  A new survey shows most people have misconceptions about what works best to save energy.
Keeping lights off isn’t a bad idea in itself, but it has significantly less impact than swapping out the bulbs for more energy-efficient ones, says Shahzeen Attari, who published a paper on the survey.
In some cases, leaving energy-efficient lights on may actually be more effective: according the the Department of Energy, the lifespan of compact fluorescents, or CFLs, is decreased by being frequently switched off and on. If you are leaving the room for less than 15 minutes, it is actually more efficient to keep a CFL on for that time. If you will be gone for more than 15 minutes, however, it is more efficient to switch the light off.
Survey participants were asked an open-ended question on what they thought was the single most effective thing they could do to conserve energy in their lives. Attari put the most common responses into two main categories: curtailment, meaning not doing something as often, and efficiency, meaning making their energy use itself less wasteful.
The majority of the participants’ answers, such as turning off lights, changing thermostat settings and unplugging appliances, fell into the curtailment category. These actions are certainly helpful, but even more effective are efficiency changes, such as using CFL light bulbs, buying Energy Star appliances, and driving a hybrid car. In other words, it’s better to buy new, efficient equipment than to sparingly use older, energy-hungry products.
This graph shows survey participants’ mean perceived energy usage or savings in watts per hour versus actual energy usage or savings. The dotted line represents perfect accuracy:
Perceptions were often inaccurate. For example, many thought central air conditioning uses only 1.3 times the energy of a single room AC unit, when it actually uses around 3.5 times as much energy.
Many consumers don’t have a good concept of how much energy per hour a given appliance uses. People understand how much energy goes into a light bulb per hour, Attari said, but not the equivalent of how many light bulbs per hour are used by a dishwasher.
Attari also attributed a psychological phenomenon called single action bias, in which a person does one or two things to address a problem and considers themselves off the hook, as an explanation of why some believe they do more to conserve energy than they really are. When those one or two things fall into curtailment, like turning off the lights, instead of efficiency, like replacing the washer, they help less than some perceive.
Psychology aside, if each of us were to do just one or two things to save energy, Attari recommends they be replacing light bulbs with CFL bulbs and weatherizing our homes. Generalized recommendations can be muddy, however, as each person’s energy usage is different. This means that for some, the most effective thing might be to use public transportation instead of driving, or to line-dry clothes after washing them.
In another report, Gerald T. Gardner and Paul C. Stern compiled a short list of the most effective things Americans can do to save energy. Using warm or cold water to wash clothes and installing or upgrading attic insulation are two of their suggestions. See the full list in the table below:

Here are five of the most effective things you can at home to lower your energy consumption:
1. Replace incandescent light bulbs with compact fluorescent (CFL) bulbs
2. Weatherize your home with caulk or weather-stripping (80% of older homes are under-insulated)
3. Install a more efficient heating and/or air conditioning unit
4. Install or upgrade attic insulation and ventilation
5. Adjust your washing machine settings to warm, or even cold, water

984,Alternative Energy: A Guide To Greening Your Home,https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/17/alternative-energy-a-guide-to-greening-your-home/,2010/08/17,"Alternative energy is a growing market, and though many states offer tax credits, rebates, and other incentives to promote clean energy, it can still prove to be an expensive proposition.
It generally also requires plugging your energy source into the grid so you’re not left in the dark when the wind calms or the sun lingers behind clouds.
Here is a roundup of solutions that can help power a home.
Solar
Solar is, in some ways, the easiest solution, or at least one of the most accessible. Plugging into the sun requires photovoltaic solar panels, an inverter, and batteries that can store a bit of any excess energy for a rainy day.
Performance varies regionally, of course, with states in the southern and southwestern regions enjoying the most days of sun per year.
Solar panels require little maintenance once installed and can provide large amounts of electricity in fair weather. It can be expensive, however, even with incentives, and even when hooked up to batteries, it doesn’t do much good when there’s no sun for stretches at a time.
Resources
GetSolar has a database for finding a solar installer in your area. It’s wise to compare quotes from several companies. Some installers prefer to install panels sold by their companies, while others will install any panels you purchase.
It’s also possible to rent solar panels. One of the largest renters is Citizenrē REnU, which offers 1, 5 or 25-year contracts that include installation.
Wind
Wind energy is often associated with mammoth wind farms, but smaller sized turbines are also produced for backyard energy production.
The speed of the wind is the determining factor in whether wind power is the right solution for your home. Weather services can tell you what the average wind speed in your region is, but it can vary within a region.
Not surprisingly, bigger turbines can produce larger amounts of energy. A 10-kilowatt turbine can usually provide enough energy for a house and is usually around 100 feet tall with a 23-foot turbine.
As with solar, wind energy is climate-dependent so when the turbine’s not turning, you might need a different energy source. Unlike solar, wind turbines have the added con of being built of out of moving parts that need regular maintenance.
Resources
A turbine large enough to power a home often requires a permit. The American Wind Energy Association offers a useful guide for going through the necessary steps to install your own turbine, as well as a list of wind gear providers.
If you’re low on space or looking for a plug-and-play solution, try a personal wind turbine like Southwest Windpower’s Air-X. It can produce up to 400 watts, enough to offset some lighting and appliance usage, and can be installed on top of a roof.
Alternatively, try Clarian’s Jellyfish When it hits the market next year, i will be able to provide the same potential wattage and also feature the ability to power your home by plugging into any standard wall outlet.
If you’re a do-it-yourselfer, find an old treadmill and take a stab at making your own as in this video:

Geothermal
Most geothermal energy is produced large scale, so single-home geothermal is usually limited to heating and cooling solutions. Still, considering how much energy indoor climate control can consume, geothermal heat pumps can significantly reduce your energy needs.
Geothermal heat pumps tap into the earth’s stable temperature to regulate that in your home. The pump moves heat from the earth to your home in winter and pulls the heat inside your house outside in summer.
Most pumps are built simply so they require little, if any maintenance, and  can be equipped with a household water heater as well.
Geothermal heat pumps are not a full-service solution, even for heating and cooling. Some models have been shown to reduce energy bills by up to 40%, which means you can’t say goodbye to your utility company and be completely comfortable indoors.
Cost is another concern. A heat pump with enough capacity to keep a home cozy averages just shy of $8,000, but the drilling required to install it can be upwards of $30,000.
Resources
Because of the amount and depth of drilling involved, geothermal heat pumps are not typically a do-it-yourself project. To find a reliable contractor, check the International Ground Source Heat Pump Association‘s directory of accredited installers to find one in your area.
Micro hydro electricity
This one only works if you live near moving water, but it can be very effective. Installation requires running a pipe from a high area where water is flowing to a lower piece of ground. Energy is produced as water moves downhill and turns a turbine at the end of the pipe.
Some micro hydro systems have been capable of producing ten or even 100 times more power than wind or solar. Unlike wind and solar, it can run non-stop and overnight, so long as the water continues to flow. An inverter and batteries can be connected to store extra energy if needed.
As with wind, the turbine requires maintenance and has the potential to break. Also, the size and pressure of the stream affects its energy production, so a very small stream might not be enough to power an entire house. Small streams also carry the risk of drying up in summer or freezing in cold weather.
Resources
You’ll probably need a contractor to install a micro hydro system. Many cities and states require anyone installing alternative energy sources to be a licensed electrician, especially if it connects to the grid. Although there isn’t a national licensing organization for micro hydro installers in the U.S., a local search should or call to your utility company should point you in the right direction.
Or, if you know what you’re doing and are as handy and patient as this guy, you can build your own micro hydro system.
Kössler, a joint venture between Siemens and Voith, makes several turbines designed for small power stations.
Energy Systems & Design also produces micro hydro equipment that can be used for a single home.
Fuel cells
Fuel cells use fuel and an oxidizing agent, typically hydrogen and oxygen, to produce heat and electricity. Inside the cell, he hydrogen’s ions and electrons are separated. An electrolyte substance inside the cell lets ions pass through but blocks electrons, which travel through a wire instead, in the form of electricity. The remaining ions turn into water or carbon dioxide when they meet with oxygen.
Resources
Bloom Energy‘s relatively new Bloom Box, which we reported on earlier this year, might be one of the most talked about home fuel cell solutions, though with its current price tag of $700,000-$800,000, it’s not exactly cheap.
Acumentrics manufactures fuel cells primarily for military use, but can also supply you with one for your home.
Most fuel cell companies don’t sell directly to the public, so you’ll have to search for an installer. FuelCellToday‘s directory can help you find one in your area.
The Department of Energy is working on developing best practices for safe hydrogen handling.
Biomass
Biomass for the home usually comes in the form of a stove used either for general home heating, or to heat water. Stoves are usually fueled by plants, including crops, trees, wood waste or grass. Biomass stoves do pollute the air, but many still consider them green because they contribute less pollution with fewer harmful chemicals than fossil fuels.
Resources
Those looking to buy a biofuel stove might try Bixby‘s MaxFire, which can be fueled with dry-shelled corn or wood pellets.
Bixby claims the stove can reduce heating costs by up to 50% and keep a typical home warm for about $1.50 per day. The stove ignites immediately with the push of a button and has eight heat level settings. When fuel is burned, the stove automatically pushes ash into a drawer that can be emptied without too much of a mess.
None of these solutions provide a fail-safe way to meet all your energy needs, but with blackouts from overburdened grids and severe weather conditions, neither do utility companies. It can be argued that some of these solutions are not entirely green, but even if they can’t completely alleviate the need for fossil fuels, they can help reduce the amount we need.
Most states offer incentives for alternative energy investments, and the Department of Energy suggests additional ways to lower usage and costs and lists products that are currently eligible for federal tax credits.
Despite state incentives, installing alternative energy is still an expensive proposition for most, but it can pay off in the long run.

985,A123 Systems Spinoff 24M Technologies Raises $16 Million,https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/16/a123-systems-spinoff-24m-technologies-raises-16-million/,2010/08/16,"Energy storage system producer 24M Technologies spun out of lithium-ion battery maker A123 Systems today to become a separate venture.
The company raised a $10 million Series A funding round from Charles River Ventures and North Bridge Venture Partners.
The company raised an additional $6 million in a grant from the Department of Energy‘s Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E). The funding will help 24M develop batteries that can store more energy for a lower price.
24M’s technology, created in collaboration with A123 and MIT, combines the best of rechargeable batteries, fuel cells and flow batteries to create new energy storage systems. Specifically, the company wants to create batteries that improve on the energy storage capabilities of lithium ion batteries. 24M especially wants to target the transportation and electric grid industries, with the hope of creating more affordable and effective electric car batteries, some of which currently cost upwards of $10,000.
A123 will continue its involvement in the venture by helping with product development and commercialization. A123 will also receive a seat on 24M’s board of directors and an equity stake in the company.
The $6 million grant 24M received comes from the Department of Energy and its APRA-E program. It is intended to help 24M commercialize its products in collaboration with Rutgers and MIT.

986,Additech's $4.6 Million Additive Funding,https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/13/additech-tranche-adams-capital/,2010/08/13," This week Additech, a fuel systems maintenance and software business in Houston, scored a $4.6 million investment SEC filings revealed.
The company’s earlier backers Adams Capital Management, BEV Capital and 9 individual angels provided the tranche money. To date, Additech has raised about $35 million.
The chairman of Additech, Ralph Koehrer, explained in an e-mail that his company will use this money to “grow the number of fuel centers [that have] our service,” and launch a new, “drive clean across America” marketing campaign short term.
Additech’s systems include interactive merchandising software, and dispensers of engine cleaning fuel additives, as well as displays that play commercials while drivers fill up. These are installed at gas stations in 16 states, from Texas to Florida and up to the Carolinas.
Its main customers include H-E-B, Kroger and the operator of Wal-Mart stores’ gas stations Murphy USA.
The company is eyeing new business in California and Arizona.
With its technical capabilities and reach, Koehrer confirmed, Additech could help gas stations distribute biofuels (or other renewable liquid fuels) in the future, though the company hasn’t committed to do so yet.
Adams Capital Management general partner in Austin Martin Neath says for now, Additech is “Mak[ing] it incredibly easy for people to make their cars and trucks run cleaner and get better gas mileage. You pick your grade of gas at the pump and you’re asked ‘Do you want to put some additive in…? Yes? Well,  you don’t have to get dirty or anything.’ Do this once every three months or so and get better mileage. It’s good for the environment, and your pocketbook.”
Gas stations (or “fuel centers” in industry parlance) get a share of Additech’s revenue for allowing its systems to be installed and maintained at their stations.
Additech makes about 10% of its revenue from its media business, and 90% from its merchandising systems, and sales of its custom-blended fuel additives at the pump. Its fuel additives are made by Afton Chemical and include two detergent cleaners and a friction modifier.

987,Flying Green: The Possibilities And Challenges Of Electric Aircraft,https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/12/flying-green-electric-aircraft/,2010/08/12,"
Airplanes release greenhouse emissions into the atmosphere and require enormous amounts of fuel to fly. A Boeing 747 can consume up to five gallons of fuel per mile. But what if planes could be powered by electricity?  Though they won’t replace passenger airliners anytime soon, small, zero-emission, electric planes are flying today.
Engineers have been pursing electric flight for decades. In 1979, the Solar Riser became the first manned electric aircraft to fly. It used photovoltaic cells to charge a battery that powered an electric motor, but could only fly five minutes, at which point it could either glide or land.
Many enhancements have been made since, and several models of electric planes are showing signs of promise. Two of the most interesting planes to fly recently are the E430 and the SkySpark.
Yuneec International‘s E430 won the Lindbergh Electric Airplane Prize at the World Electric Aircraft Symposium last month. Yuneec opened a 260,000 square foot factory in China and was the first commercially available electric aircraft, with a price tag of $89,000.
The E430 seats two people and flies up to 95 miles per hour, or 60 miles per hour when cruising. Without passengers the plane weighs 561 pounds, which includes its 184-pound lithium polymer battery that needs three to four hours to charge.
This video from Yuneec shows the plane in action:

The SkySpark set a record for electric airplane air speed when it reached 155 miles per hour last year. It also runs on lithium polymer batteries, though its manufacturer, the Italian startup DigiSky, wants to try hydrogen fuel cells next.
Here is a video of its record-setting flight:

Electric planes capture the imaginations and ambitions of many, including Tesla founder Elon Musk, who has said he’s interested in building an “electric super sonic plane” in the future.
NASA is also behind the cause, helping run Centennial Challenges for Aeronautics competitions to encourage aircraft innovation. Next summer’s competition, the Green Flight Challenge, will center around efficiency: the minimum bar for entry will be for aircraft that can surpass the equivalent fuel-efficiency of 200 miles per gallon per passenger.
The technology is improving, but that doesn’t mean it’s near developed enough to green up 747s. One of the main things prohibiting passenger planes from going electric is battery technology. Batteries with enough juice to power a plane are heavy and large, but airplanes need to be light to take off and stay in the air.
Solar powered airplanes have the advantage of being lightweight in comparison to battery-powered planes. Earlier this summer, a solar powered airplane set a new record by flying for 26 straight hours. Its 12,000 solar cells charged batteries that took over when the sun set. This solar/battery combination can theoretically keep a plane in the air for years, though its size and weight capacity is still limited by battery technology.
Wireless power transmission has also been tested, though far less than battery and solar. The technology sends microwave energy or lasers through the air to an airplane’s receiver. NASA has demonstrated the technology works with small, unmanned solar craft, but has yet to try it on larger aircraft.
Another concept that could help longer flights become more feasible is regenerative soaring, in which a propeller acts as a wind turbine to generate energy when the plane flies through an updraft. The Electraflyer C‘s propeller can be turned into a wind-powered generator at a flip of a switch to charge its lithium-ion-polymer batteries. The plane weighs 380 pounds and can fly about 90 minutes, reaching speeds of up to 80 miles per hour. Once drained, the batteries require a six-hour charge.
It’ll be a long time before your next commercial business flight is green, but those considering a pilot’s license have a few greener birds to choose from.

988,The Top Ten Apps To Make You More Green,https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/10/top-ten-green-apps/,2010/08/10,"There’s an app for being green, and by an app, I mean a slew of apps. These iPhone apps range from offering general sustainability tips and games to store and product directories.
A lot of green apps focus on offering general tips for everyday actions you can take to help make a difference, which really doesn’t take advantage of the iPhone’s capabilities. Below are the top ten green apps across a range of applications, some of which could help you save money in addition to living on the greener side of the fence.
1.  If you need ideas for how to be more green, try Green Genie. iTunes ($0.99) The app suggests more than 100 projects to tackle, like bringing your own grocery bags when you go shopping or reducing your company’s paper usage.
The app includes a glossary of green terms and has a library of “essential reading” on sustainability. For those who want to dive deeper, it also lists recommended websites and green organizations.
Another useful feature of the app is its plastics directory, which helps you understand what the number 5 on your yogurt container means, and why it’s may not be recyclable in your area.
Green Genie allows you to submit project ideas, and the database continues to grow as more people pitch in. This is definitely one of the most social, interactive green apps available.
2. GoodGuide iTunes (free) showcases sustainable products and features a bar code scanner to check an item’s environmental impact before buying it.
GoodGuide’s mission is to become the best information source for products’ and companies’ environmental, health and social impacts. Its database has more than 70,000 ratings in categories ranging from personal care to toys.
If a product catches your eye, you can add it to a shopping list within the app, and if you discover that your favorite deodorant doesn’t live up to your environmental standards, you can make note of that, too.  GoodGuide is a TechCrunch50 alum.
3. Carbon Tracker iTunes (free) uses GPS to calculate your carbon footprint based on how much your travel. You can chart your carbon emission changes by month and set goals to decrease them.
The app factors emission for planes, train and automobiles, as well as a few other vehicles. It also allows you to switch between miles and kilometers, in case you need to emit carbon abroad.
4. Green Outlet iTunes ($2.99) tries to predict your electric bill and carbon footprint based on what appliances you use. To get started, you find the types of appliances you have (microwave? PlayStation?) and approximate how many hours per day you use each one.
The app will estimate your electric bill and carbon footprint for the month. You can also see a breakdown of how much each appliance is costing you.
If you exceed the U.S. Government’s recommended carbon limits, the app will warn you and give you the option to purchase carbon offsets.
5. Green Gas Saver iTunes (free) tracks your driving habits and warns you through gauges and sounds if you accelerate too quickly or take a turn too hard. The app saves your score from each trip to help you improve over time. It’s a good way to become a better driver overall, in addition to saving on fuel costs.  It uses the accelerometer to detect sharp turns, but if may also GPS to constantly calculate how fast you are going, which could make it a battery hog.
6. Find Green iTunes (free) points you to nearby sustainable businesses. There are a few apps that focus on local food, but Find Green can also point you to other categories, like wellness, office and landscaping. It also lets you select distance by type of transportation, so you can choose whether to bring groceries home by foot, bike or car. You can also submit green businesses you know of to the database.
7. Get Green iTunes ($0.99) offers relevant green tips by tailoring them to the season. Getting advice on keeping your house draft-free is less relevant in summer, as are gardening tips in winter. Most of the “green tips” apps available offer randomized advice that are often pointless or laughable in the wrong weather. Get Green is the best of the bunch for being smart about the context and timing of the tips it offers.
8. Green Me is designed for list-maker types.  It iTunes ($1.99) displays a calendar and asks you to list five “green” things you’ve done each day. The built-in calendar is then marked with a shade of green correlated to how many things you did to be sustainable. The more accomplishments you list, the darker the green for that date. It’s a handy way of tracking how diligent you’ve been over time with a little game mechanics thrown in.
9. Green Charging iTunes ($0.99) makes your phone vibrate and sound an alarm when it’s fully charged to save energy. It also displays how much talk time you have at your current battery level. This app is handy because phones and other devices can use up a significant amount of energy even when they’re no longer charging. Unplugging electronics when you’re not using them is a good green habit to develop, and this app can help you get into it.
If you ever goofed off in math class by playing Drug Wars on your graphing calculator, you might enjoy Green Wars iTunes ($1.99, or free for the lite version). It’s a green twist on the classic buy low/sell high game.
In the original game, you deal drugs, but in Green Wars your inventory is packed with things like reusable shopping bags and hybrid cars. I know, it’s not as fun, but if you can forgive that it can be an engaging game.
Your goal is to buy cheap green products, travel to a different area in the game, and try to sell them at a profit. Loans are available to buy more items, and once you start earning, you can deposit your bounty to start earning interest.
It won’t make you more green directly, but it might help you keep those green thoughts front and center.
Many other green apps exist that encourage sustainability, but some things still have to be done manually. Separating and taking out the recycling or turning the compost? No, there’s still no app for that.

990,Portable Solar Panel Keeps USB Gadgets And Cell Phones Charged Off The Grid,https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/06/portable-solar-panel/,2010/08/06,"A new charger from Horizon Fuel Cell Technologies can help power your gadgets when there’s nowhere to plug into but the sun.
The Sunbox USB has a panel that can be attached outside of a house or tent that connects to a box with several charging ports. Horizon claims the unit can power an LED light included with the device for as long as 11 hours, so long as the panel sees the six to eight hours of sun it needs for a full charge.
A pair of USB ports help keep gadgets charged, and two other ports – one for charging cell phones and one that connects to a couple of AA batteries – could help you stay connected in remote areas.
The $79.99 two-part system might not be the most convenient thing to toss into a backpack for a camping trip, but it could provide power in remote areas or in an emergency. Other products like Lenmar’s Powerport for $69.95 and are more compact but don’t offer and LED light and the option to charge AA batteries.
Less expensive options like the $30 Scosche solBAT II we reviewed earlier this year are much smaller, but take a lot longer (four to five days!) to produce a full charge from solar alone. Charging while off the grid could be convenient, but whether or not a cell phone can find signal after it’s charged is another story.

It is estimated that the amount of heat within 30,000 feet below the earth’s surface holds potentially 50,000 times more energy than all global oil and natural gas resources combined.  According to the Geothermal Energy Association, up to 6,400 megawatts of new capacity could be created from the geothermal projects under development in the U.S. But getting to that energy is proving to be a challenge.
Geothermal energy comes in a variety of forms, from residential fixtures to power a single home, to commercial plants that can power a city. Energy is usually harnessed from hot underground water or steam that naturally rises to the surface. Power plants drill holes into the rock to gain more direct access and use the hot water and steam to drive electric generators. After its use, the water can be pumped back underground to heat up anew. Power plants use different energy harnessing designs based on the type and temperature of the geothermal resource available.
Geothermal deals are heating up as it begins to prove itself as a viable energy source.  For instance, Ormat Technologies recently bought Constellation Energy’s 50% share of the Mammoth Geothermal Plant in California for $72.5 million. The deal gives Ormat three power plants capable of generating 29 megawatts of power and rights to more than 10,000 acres of undeveloped federal lands.
Ormat’s home state of Nevada is a geothermal powerhouse. According to the Geothermal Energy Association, the state produces more geothermal energy than all but eight nations. Its geothermal capacity jumped from 200 to 400 megawatts during the last five years, and as many as 3,000 more megawatts are expected to be generated from developing projects. A typical coal-fired power plant can generate about 500 megawatts, though some are much larger. Nuclear power plants typically range from a 500 to 2000 megawatt capacity.
Unlike wind and solar, whose energy outputs fluctuate based on weather conditions, geothermal provides consistent base load electricity, which is the minimum amount a power utility’s customers need. It is also considered clean because it produces no greenhouse gas pollution, and renewable because the water can be reused. Last year, Obama gave $350 million in Recovery Act funding for geothermal projects.
Most geothermal plants have been located near the edges of tectonic plates, where there is a lot of geothermal activity, but companies like AltaRock Energy, which has received funding from Google, among others, are developing ways to generate steam in other geographic areas. The technology, known as Enhanced Geothermal Systems, drills into hot rocks miles below the surface and pumps cold water down to them to generate steam. The technology has been in development for a while, though there have been concerns that EGS might trigger seismic activity that could lead to earthquakes.
It’s been a very rocky road, to say the least. Last year, AltaRock abandoned its trials near a plant called The Geysers in northern California when instabilities in the rock caused the borehole to collapse. The company moved its tests to Oregon where it is working on a three-year EGS demo near Newberry National Volcanic National Monument. AltaRock’s competitor, Ram Power Corporation, purchased The Geysers in June. If the AltaRock’s Oregon demo is successful, a power generator will be placed next to the wells to test how much energy can be harnessed from them.

The Fort Worth, Texas based company makes concentrating photovoltaics and tubular skylights meant to replace office and school lighting with sunlight.
Entech Solar was founded in 1984, though its current name was created in 2008 when photovoltaic installer WorldWater & Solar Technology bought Entech, Inc. Quercus Trust invested $35 million then, and the fund’s David Gelbaum stepped in as Entech Solar CEO in February of this year.
The company’s solar modules provide both heat and electricity by concentrating sunlight into its cells, and Entech Solar claims its electric and thermal energy output can generate up to five times as much energy as traditional photovoltaics.

993,Stanford Heats Up Solar Power With New Harnessing Technology,https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/02/stanford-solar-heat-pete/,2010/08/02,"A Stanford University research group says it found a way to more than double current solar power production efficiency. The technology uses both light and heat from the sun and is inexpensive enough that, if it pans out, it might be able to compete with oil.
Most current technology can either convert light into electricity at relatively low temperatures, or convert the sun’s heat at very high temperatures. Stanford engineers claim they developed a way to do both.
The photon enhanced thermionic emission, or PETE, works best at high temperatures, where current photovoltaics struggle. Solar panels usually use silicon to convert photons to electricity, but only from a certain portion of the light spectrum. Unused photons generate heat in the cells, making them perform poorly and losing up to 50% of the energy reaching the solar panel.
Professor Nick Melosh, who led the research group, says PETE works best at higher temperatures, making it most effective when used with solar concentrators like parabolic mirrors used in solar farms, rather than as rooftop solar panel replacements. If installed in solar farms, PETE could also pass any waste heat it can’t convert to a solar farm’s thermal conversion system. The team’s vision is to attach PETE devices to existing systems.
Solar panels are often expensive because they require a lot of silicon, but one PETE device needs only about a six-inch wafer of semiconducting material, reducing the amount of investment capital needed to get it off the ground.
According to the research team’s estimates, the devices could reach 60% efficiency on solar farms. Falling short of that goal could still have significant effects. The team said if they can boost efficiency to 30%, it could make the cost of solar power comparable to oil.
This video from Stanford explains more about the project:

994,Department Of Outlandish Ideas: Build Solar Roadways,https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/02/solar-roadways/,2010/08/02,"
If you want to change the world, you have to think big.  Say what you want about the feasibility of Scott Brusaw’s idea to replace asphalt roads with miles of solar ribbons that cars and trucks can drive on, it is a very ambitious idea.  Brusaw is the co-founder and CEO of Solar Roadways, a bootstrapped startup in Idaho.  He is an engineer, and is building prototypes of solar panels that could be used as roads.
Brusaw wants to create solar panels strong enough to support the weight of cars and trucks driving at 80 miles per hour.  There is so much road surface in America, that the collected energy could replace other forms of fossil fuel energy, even with really inefficient solar panels.  Even better, since roads go to each home and business, the roads themselves would not only collect the energy, but distribute it.  The energy wouldn’t power cars themselves, except maybe electric vehicles juicing up at roadside charging stations.  LEDs could be built into the roadways and used as signs.  The concept is explained in the video below, which is part of a larger film project called YERT (Your Environmental Roadtrip).
The video shows Brusaw building some of these solar road panels in what looks like a garage. The Infrastructurist blog calls the scheme “dubious.” But the big, unanswered question is how much would this cost.  It most definitely would cost more than conventional roads, which are under-funded already.  But regular roads can’t offset their costs by producing energy (this is all assuming the technology can actually work at scale without too much maintenance).  It also most definitely would cost more than plain-vanilla solar panels.
If the idea is “roads that pay for themselves” these cost issues need to be addressed before anyone will take this concept seriously.  It is not clear why paving the country’s roads with glass is a better energy solution than simply setting up solar energy farms which connect to the existing energy grid.  I’d really like to see what the proposed cost of these roadways would be and what the payback period would be in terms of energy produced.
The other question this raises is what would be the lifespan of these roadways compared to regular asphalt.  And how often would the panels need to be replaced simply to take advantage of improving solar technology and better solar panels. Will we have to upgrade our roads every two years, and who is going to pay for that?  Still, I like the fact that Brusaw is swinging for the fences and actually trying to build prototypes.
Update:  Brusaw answers with some numbers.   “We’re still in the prototyping stages,” he says Brusaw, “so we haven’t manufactured anything yet. Our target price is $10K per panel.”  Each panel is 12′ X 12′, so it would take 440 panels for each mile of single-lane road.  That is $4.4 million per mile, which he figures will produce enough electricity (7600 watt-hours per day) to power 428 homes.  He thinks the payback period would be 20 years, and would drop significantly with manufacturing scale.

The Khosla Ventures and Sigma Partners backed company makes dynamic glass windows that can be tinted on demand to block excess light and heat.
Founded in 2007, Soladigm had been operating in “stealth mode.” The company employs about 50 people in its Milpitas, California headquarters, and plans to hire about 300 employees over the next few years for the Mississippi plant.
A $40 million loan and another $4 million in incentives from the state influenced Soladigm’s decision to locate operations in Mississippi. Soladigm pledged to invest $130 million by 2016 in its business there in order to receive the state’s full incentive package.
The new Soladigm plant’s proximity to Memphis transportation connections will also help the company quickly ship its glass panels.
According to the company, its tinted windows can eliminate the need for blinds and reduce building heating and cooling costs by up to 25%.

997,Xtreme Power Gets $29.5 million to Store More Power From Renewables,https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/27/xtreme-power-funding/,2010/07/27,"
A Kyle, Texas company that makes utility scale power storage systems, Xtreme Power, nabbed a $29.5 million, series C round of venture funding the company announced today. The investment was co-led by Bessemer Venture Partners, the venture capital arm of The Dow Chemical Company and clean tech investors SAIL Venture Partners.
Xtreme Power aims to alleviate problems associated with renewable energy sources with utility-scale dry cell batteries, and software that monitors power flow in and out of them.
The company does not sell individual batteries, notes Xtreme Power’s chief development officer, Darrell Hayslip, but “power systems” that include a “containerized unit with essentially large banks of batteries arranged in series and in parallel. A typical unit has 1,200 1-kilowatt hour power cells in it, and has the ablity to store 1,200 kilowatt hours of electricity. [Xtreme Power] manages that rack and system by looking at the voltage within.” The materials included in the units are 90% recyclable, he says, and can store generated power for weeks.
Providing reliable solar and wind power storage at a large scale means that when the sun’s not shining or the wind’s not blowing, power utilities can still meet peak energy demand with electricity generated by these non-hydrocarbon sources.
Xtreme Power’s fiberglass dry cell batteries are already working in systems from Antarctica to Hawaii. The company says they can work for 20 years, then get recycled. The batteries work even after they’ve been shot through with bullets, Xtreme Power has claimed.
As reported earlier by Industrial Fuels and Power: “Xtreme Power is retooling a closed Ford Motor factory…as part of a joint venture with Clairvoyant Energy with the aim of producing 2000 megawatts of batteries a year…”
An Xtreme Power spokesperson today confirmed that part of its newly attained funding will be dedicated to the development of that joint venture, and the site now known as the Ford Renewable Energy Park.
The park (in Wixom, Michigan) will be used by Clairvoyant Energy and Xtreme Power to continue research, development, manufacturing and demonstration of their products. But the 320-acre site will also be open to suppliers and other manufacturers in the energy industry. Clairvoyant Energy and Xtreme Power have another goal of creating a minimum of 4,000 energy jobs in the area.
Another piece of Xtreme Energy’s C-series funding will go to to bolster its wind power generating farm project in Hawaii. The New York Times today reported that Hawaii’s “state officials want 70 percent of energy needs to be met by renewable sources like the wind, sun or biomass by 2030.”

The project, led by RSW’s Renewable Energy Research, received $5.5 million in funding from Sustainable Development Technology Canada and the government of Quebec. RER will install two turbines in the St. Lawrence River.
RSW RER, along with TREK technology, will develop the turbines to be covered, self-anchoring and rated at 250 kilowatts. They will be placed near the Old Port of Montreal before the end of the year.
Some question turbines’ environmental impact since they can pose hazards to aquatic plant and animal life. Several turbines have regularly killed fish that got sucked in or caught up in the blades, and some have restricted the passage of silt and nutrients. Barnacles can also weigh down the blades over time, decreasing their efficiency. As far as hydropower solutions go however, turbines do less to disturb the environment than dams.

Nissan chose to release to those five states first because they’re home to the EV project, the world’s largest electric vehicle and infrastructure deployment designed to collect data on EV performance in different climates and terrains. ECOtality, which runs the project, received a $99.8 million grant from the Department of Energy last year and will also study charging infrastructure effectiveness and revenue models.
The Leaf will arrive in Texas and Hawaii in January of 2011, head to North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Washington DC, Virginia, Maryland, South Carolina and Alabama in April and roll into the rest of the country by year’s end.

The company is conducting daily tests of three research cars to study battery systems and electric drive components.
Porsche President and CEO Michael Macht said in a statement that Porsche will “definitely be offering electric sports cars in the future,” but that the performance and cruising range must be comparable to existing sports cars. Greater efficiency and lower emissions are the company’s goals for the new vehicles.
The Boxsters will compete with Tesla‘s Roadster, which has been in production since 2008 and recently received a makeover. With Tesla’s help, Toyota is rumored to also be working on an electric sports car.
The original Boxster was produced in 1996 and became the company’s top selling car for about seven years.
Electric Boxster cars will be field tested early next year to determine what infrastructure is needed to support regular usage and to observe how users drive the car.
But don’t get too excited yet – it will still be a while before the new Boxsters hit the road, and with companies like Mercedes and Audi also working on electric sports cars, they will have plenty of competition.

1001,"NY, NJ Parking Lots Sign Up to Charge Electric Vehicles",https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/24/ev-chargers-in-ny-nj/,2010/07/24,"
The Car Charging Group, Inc. (CCGI) this weekend announced a partnership with LAZ Parking in New York and New Jersey to begin outfitting its facilities with smart, electric vehicle charging stations.
The Miami-based CCGI installs and maintains electric vehicle charging stations in government-owned lots, and at commercial sites like shopping malls, hotels, stadiums and corporate parking garages. LAZ Parking operates over 1,300 parking facilities in 21 states and 99 cities. The LAZ Parking sites will be equipped by CCGI with smart, ChargePoint Level II, 240 volts charging stations, manufactured by Coulomb Technologies.
Smart charging stations, unlike those designed for home-garage use, have metering and e-commerce capabilities, and are visible online. Drivers can find smart charging stations on Google Maps, for example.
Coloumb Technologies, the recipient of a $15 million Department of Energy grant (funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act through the Transportation Electrification Initiative) is a leader in sales of charging stations in the U.S.
The company is, with some of its government grant money, setting up — sometimes temporarily free — public electric vehicle charging stations throughout the country, including New York City’s first.
General Electric and Toyota  have announced that they are developing and will sell their own smart charging stations, as well.

The Department of Energy estimates that charging station locations in the U.S. will increase 41 times over between 2009 and 2012.
Citing consumer demand and a slew of new charging station technology, and vehicle models — like the Nissan Leaf, GM Chevy Volt, Fisker Karma, and Tesla Model S — Car Charging Group, Inc.’s president Andy Kinard said Saturday that he wouldn’t be surprised if the Obama administration fulfilled its goal: getting one million plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles on the road by 2015.
To recharge at public or commercially installed stations, Kinard says hybrid and electric vehicle owners should be prepared to pay about $3 per hour. He noted: “It’s hard to get 220 volts out into the streets. [Parking facilities] do have to charge more than it would cost an electric vehicle driver to plug in at home. But that’s nothing compared to gas prices now. And it will still be cheaper than what you spend driving an internal combustion engine.”

1002,Marriott Unveils Green Hotel Prototype,https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/23/marriott-unveils-green-hotel-prototype/,2010/07/23,"Marriott International today unveiled a prototype that will help it build more green, LEED-certified hotels.
The prototype is the first of its kind for the U.S. hotel industry, the company says.
LEED, or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, is a voluntary rating system developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC).
LEED-certified buildings are designed to meet environmental goals including reducing landfill waste and greenhouse gas emissions, conserving energy and water and lowering operating costs.
The Courtyard Charleston/Summerville is the first of Marriott hotels following the new, green design. It is expected to open for business in South Carolina in 2012.
Using the prototype will save the hotel giant six months of design time on each hotel. That’s about what the company says it would usually take to design a LEED-certificate worth new property. Marriott plans to roll out similar prototypes for its other brands in the future, including Residence Inn by Marriott and Towne Place Suites.
The company also expects to save about $100,000, and up to 25% in energy and water savings on each hotel built following this prototype.
Going green is nothing new to Marriott. It currently owns close to 50 LEED-certified hotels and aims to raise that number to 300 by 2015.
According to the USGBC, there are currently 937 LEED registered and certified hotels in the U.S.
The environmental bug has hit the economy segment of the industry, too.
A Motel 6 in Northlake, Texas became the country’s first LEED-certified motel property earlier this month.
And Motel 6 is using a prototype approach to increase its number of LEED-certified motels as well.

The Hub’s goal is to develop ways to convert solar energy into chemical fuels and scale the technology for commercial use.
The project is in part inspired by the way plants produce energy, and will use artificial photosynthesis to turn sunlight, water and carbon dioxide into clean fuel. Researchers will be charged with finding ways to use technologies like light absorbers, catalysts, molecular linkers and separation membranes to transform sunlight into fuel, and the DOE aims to quickly turn the research into a viable product in the form of fuel that can go directly into cars without any additional processing.
Artificial photosynthesis is not a new technology, and researchers at MIT and the University of Rochester have been seeking solutions for some time. The DOE hopes the Hub will spark collaborations to make more progress in the field.
The Hub will have two locations: One on Caltech’s campus in Pasadena and one at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley. Several other California universities will participate as well, including UC Santa Barbara, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. Funding will be provided over five years, with $22 million awarded this year and up to $25 million per year thereafter.

The company will build four wind power projects for the Alta Wind Energy Center in Kern County, California, for which Vestas-American Wind Technology will provide 190 turbines with a capacity of 570 megawatts. This is the largest number of wind turbines ever ordered for a single site in the U.S.
The Alta Wind Energy Center currently hosts 150 megawatt GE turbines and is expected to become the largest wind energy farm in the country with a capacity of 3,000 megawatts when completed. Terra-Gen has agreements with Southern California Edison to feed the energy into its grid.
The wind farm’s financing is the largest of any wind energy project in North America and comes primarily from Citibank, which committed to buy the projects when they start operating commercially. Terra-Gen will lease the projects from Citibank and continue to operate the farm.
The completed wind energy farm will raise California’s wind capacity 25%, supplying renewable energy to about 200,000 homes. Vestas will deliver its turbines beginning in October, and the first project phase is expected to go online in January of 2011.

1005,"American Airlines Greening Fleet, Adding GoGo",https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/21/american-airlines-greening-fleet-adding-gogo/,2010/07/21,"
American Airlines announced today that it is buying 35 Next-Generation Boeing 737-800s to replace aging planes in its fleet. These aircraft are 35% more fuel efficient than the MD80 aircraft that they are replacing – which saves about 800,000 gallons of fuel per aircraft per year, the airline reports.
The new planes will be equipped with bigger overhead storage bins, and more AC power ports among other new interior features.
Good news for Gogo Inflight Internet: American Airlines also intends to equip all of its new 737s with wifi service, so passengers can surf the web, check e-mail and send instant messages from the air (but hopefully not indulge in loudly using video- and VOIP-services).
American Airlines currently has 167 planes equipped with Gogo (but only two of them are 737s).
The airline prohibits the use of VOIP on its in flight internet service. A company spokesperson explained today, “This restriction is a reaction to widespread passenger aversion to the idea of many people talking loudly on flights as we’ve all experienced before take-off or after landing.” It is difficult to stop every instance of VoIP, she adds, but Aircell — the airborne communications firm that owns and operates the consumer, wireless internet brand Gogo — is monitoring and working constantly to enforce this request.
American Airlines adds the new 737s to 84 previous orders. It started bringing the 737s into its narrowbody fleet as of April 2009. The company expects to have a total of 195 of these planes by the end of 2012.
Gerard Arpey, chief executive and chairman of AMR Corp., the company that owns American Airlines, in a press statement noted that the new aircraft would help the company “manage through future fuel price volatility, which continues to be a challenge for the entire industry.”
The International Air Transport Association and Platts report that the cost of jet fuel is up 24% year-over-year, now. The global trade group for the air transport industry also estimates that the average expenditure on jet fuel this year will reach $88.2 billion, up $17 billion from last year, globally.

1006,Google Energy's First Purchase: 20 Years of Wind Power,https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/20/google-energy-windpower-jul20/,2010/07/20,"
Google Energy today announced an agreement to purchase 114 megawatts of wind power capacity per year for 20 years at a set price from an Iowa wind farm owned and operated by NextEra Energy Resources.
A Google spokesperson Jamie Yood noted, “This is the first contract for Google Energy. We plan on exploring other opportunities to provide our data centers with environmentally friendly power [in 2010]. It isn’t limited to wind power.”
But the company isn’t planning to immediately use the wind power from the Iowa facility on its own operations.
Iowa is the second most wind power-generating state in the U.S. according to the American Wind Energy Association with existing power capacity of 3,670 megawatts and another 200 megawatts of capacity on the way. Texas leads with 9,505 megawatts in existing wind power generation capacity.
NextEra Energy Resources is the 18,000 megawatt power supply division — with 42% or 7,650 megawatts of that power from wind — of NextEra Energy, Inc., the Juno, Fla. energy company with revenue over $15 billion.
Overall, NextEra Energy employs more than 15,000 in 28 states and Canada, and has nearly 43,000 megawatts of generating capacity through wind, solar, hydro, natural gas, oil and nuclear.
Before it had established its energy subsidiary, Google invested $38.8 million directly in NextEra Energy’s large, utility-scale wind power generation projects in North Dakota.
Google also made significant investments in clean energy research and development projects, and startups — including AltaRock Energy, eSolar and AlertMe — through its “Renewable Energy Cheaper Than Coal” (or RE<C) and other philanthropic, partnership and venture capital efforts.
The search leader won the federal government’s approval to buy and sell energy as of February this year.
Now Google Energy allows it to: get electricity at favorable prices, lock in these prices over the long haul, use the power it buys for its own data centers and operations, and sell surplus energy to regional markets. Through this strategy, Yood says, “We’re partially protecting ourselves against future increases in power prices.”
Google also gathers RECs or renewable energy certificates along the way. In the laymen’s view, RECs are just like carbon offsets.
As the Environmental Protection Agency more stiffly defines them, RECs are sold independently of “physical electricity associated with a renewable-based generation source,” and “allow organizations to support renewable energy development and protect the environment when green power products are not locally available.”
Google could obtain RECs by just purchasing them from other companies who have invested in, or generated power from renewable sources. But then it wouldn’t have the operational advantage of predictably priced power.
Google Energy and NextEra Energy Resources declined to discuss the numbers behind the set pricing for their wind power deal.
But a NextEra Energy spokesman noted on Tue. “A long term commitment [by Google] to purchase a significant portion of the output from one of our wind projects is obviously a good thing for us.”
Google first established its goal of offsetting its own carbon footprint in 2007. This deal should bring it 114 megawatts per year closer to carbon neutrality.
Update: The total capacity of the particular Iowa wind farm from which Google is buying power is 150 megawatts. Of that, Google will be purchasing the power from 114 megawatts capacity. Jamie Yood of Google offered this detail: “Because the wind resource in this part of Iowa is amongst the best in the country, it is to early to tell what the long term performance will be. But wind farms in the region produce between 35% and 45% of nominal capacity, meaning [Google’s] purchase would represent between 350 million and 450 million kilowatt hours of renewable energy annually for twenty years.”

1007,A Facebook Game With a Mission: Waste Management to Launch Oceanopolis,https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/20/waste-management-to-launch-oceanopolis-facebook-game/,2010/07/20,"Waste Management and its subsidiary Greenopolis are diving into social gaming with a new Facebook app called Oceanopolis. The game will launch in beta, with a full rollout expected in the coming weeks.
In the game, players maintain their own island by recycling trash to build a sustainable community and interacting with friends. Points earned virtually turn into printable coupons that can be used at movie theaters, restaurants and stores. Alternatively, they can be turned into cash donations. Points can also be earned in real life through recycling or through blogging on Greenopolis‘ site.

When Greenopolis, a environmentally themed social networking site and blogging community launched two years ago, Michael Arrington wrote that it would be better suited as a Facebook application. Oceanopolis seems to fit that bill.
According to the site, Greenopolis members have earned 6.7 million rewards and the physical recycling kiosks have recovered 3.5 million bottles, cans and other items thus far.
Greenopolis and Oceanopolis Creative Director Anthony Zolezzi said the reason for creating Oceanopolis was to virtually engage consumers. “It’s critically important that large companies get involved in the solution,” he added. “One thing Waste Management does is lets Greenopolis operate independently as part of a solution.” Waste Management is the largest recycler in North America.
Oceanopolis is kicking off its beta launch with a fundraiser for Ocean Aid, which will hold an annual concert to fund research on pollution-filled ocean gyres. Greenopolis will donate a dollar on behalf of anyone who tweets: “Make waves. Fight ocean pollution with http://apps.Facebook.com/Oceanopolis #Oceanopolis.”
It remains to be seen whether recycling on a virtual island can inspire real-life recycling, and whether Oceanopolis will be able to gain a significant user base. At the very least, Oceanopolis could be an addictive game to feel good instead of guilty about playing.

1008,Solazyme Provides U.S. Navy with Algal Jet Fuel,https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/19/solazyme-navy-jet-fuel/,2010/07/19,"Biofuel producer Solazyme delivered 1,500 gallons of its algae-based jet fuel to the U.S. Navy’s testing and certification program today, helping the military reach its goal of switching half of its fleet to clean fuel by 2020. The Navy will use the fuel to power jets.
Solazyme produces fuel by fermenting algae to create oils and biomaterials including fuel, skin care, chemical and  animal feed products. The company claims the Solajet HRJ-5 fuel it delivered to the Navy produces 85% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuels. In the next two weeks, Solazyme will also provide the Navy with 20,000 gallons of F-76 naval distillate fuel to be used in military ships.
The South San Francisco based company was founded in 2003 and received $21.8 million in federal grant funding from the U.S. Department of Energy last December.

1009,Toyota Settles Longstanding Patent Dispute Over Hybrid Vehicle Tech,https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/19/toyota-settles-longstanding-patent-dispute-over-hybrid-vehicle-tech/,2010/07/19,"
Toyota settled a longstanding patent dispute today with Paice LLC, a firm that first sued the Japanese automakers back in 2004.
The technology disputed had to do with supplying torque from both an electric motor and an internal combustion engine to a car’s wheels, according to earlier reports by Bloomberg BusinessWeek and confirmed by a Paice spokesperson today.
Paice had gone as far as asking the U.S. International Trade Comission to force Toyota to halt export of its hybrid vehicles to the U.S., where its Prius is the top-selling hybrid.
Now, Toyota will pay Paice under a licensing agreement (for which terms have not been disclosed) for patented technology which is included in the following current models and others: Prius 3, the hybrid Camry, RX-450 and the HS-250h.
Paice calls itself a “startup technology development” firm. Because it doesn’t manufacture the technology it tests, patents and promotes, many have accused Paice of being “patent trolls.”
Toyota’s settlement with Paice followed another settlement by American automakers, Ford whose Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan hybrid vehicles, Paice alleged, had infringed on its patents.

1010,Allure Energy Announces a Thermostat That Knows When You're Coming Home,https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/16/allure-energy-proximity-thermostat/,2010/07/16,"Two days ago I wrote about a thermostat you can adjust from your phone, and today Allure Energy announced another twist on the idea. The company connects your thermostat to a BlackBerry or iPhone app that tracks how far you are from home and adjusts your thermostat accordingly. Think of it as a location-based service for interacting with your thermostat.
When you leave in the morning, the system calibrates your home’s thermostat so you don’t waste energy while you’re away. Likewise, it senses when you’re on your way back, returning the temperature to your perfect degree of cozy.
“We are doing for home energy management what TiVo did for the VCR,” CEO Kevin Imes said in a statement. The technology could attract those who find programming their thermostat too much of a challenge or hassle. The company says the system could increase energy savings by up to 30%.

1011,Mapping Earthquake Recovery Projects in Haiti,https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/16/mapping-earthquake-recovery-projects-in-haiti/,2010/07/16,"
Haiti is still struggling to recover from the 7-point magnitude earthquake that struck on January 12th. The natural disaster disrupted everything there, including the systems that keep water clean, garbage away from homes and farm land, and people (let alone habitat and animals) healthy.
Despite an outpouring of donations and promises to help from international nonprofits, shelter, food and medical care are still hard to find and hard to deliver in Haiti, according to recent reports from the United Nations. A new website — HaitiAidMap.org — aims to increase the efficacy and visibility of U.S. non-government orgnizations relief efforts on the ground in Haiti, though.
It maps NGO projects in country, updates them in real time, and makes information about these searchable by category, location or the NGO’s name. The site was created by InterAction, a Washington D.C. based alliance of 192 poverty-alleviating NGOs, in partnership with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Business Civic Leadership Center. It is sponsored by FedEx.

The president and chief executive of InterAction, Samuel A. Worthington, says he was inspired to use mapping innovation for NGOs originally while working on a special report for former president Bill Clinton about the relief efforts following the Indian Ocean Tsunami in 2004 that killed 230,000 people across 14 countries.
“We wanted to apply lessons learned from the Tsunami immediately following the earthquake in Haiti. One of the first things we did was to establish an NGO Coordination Office there, associated with the United Nations, to ensure better coordination among nonprofits with the UN-system and Haiti’s government both.  [We] clearly needed to know where the NGO community was working at all times. A map had been done after earlier hurricanes, but it was static, a sheet of paper. Given the size of the engagement, we needed better data,” he says.
InterAction began working on the pilot site in February. Geo-location software makers FortiusOne and open source tech consultants Development Seed built the site using GeoIQ and OpenStreetMap technology.
HaitiAidMap.org allows NGOs to link their databases (which can be as simple as Excel spreadsheets) to the site. It renders all of their data about in-country projects on a single, easily readable, interactive map. The projects are searchable by name, location, or “cluster,” through check boxes, drop-down menus, and the interactive map itself. (There’s no search field, however.)
Clusters, or categories of relief work include things like: shelter and non-food items, water sanitation and hygiene, protection or health.

Clicking on the map, it’s easy to learn things like: large central cities such as Delmas, Port Au Prince and Carrefour have more than 100 water sanitation and hygiene relief projects, while the Southern city of Port Salut has just two. Yes, Port Salut was further from the epicenter of the earthquake. But it was still damaged badly enough that many of its communities still lack necessities, and electricty though temperatures this summer have routinely ranged above 100 degrees Fahrenheit there.
Because HaitiAidMap.org aggregates NGOs’ data, relief workers and philanthropists can use it to identify where there may be a gap in services, and thus where their help is needed.
InterAction, Worthington says, has a broader goal for its mapping project: “We want to be able to map all U.S. non-government organizations’ projects globally, to see all of their billions of dollars of work around the world. By harmonizing data, and providing this mapping tool that’s linked to the databases of NGOs, starting with members of InterAction, we think we can do this within the decade.”
Eighty-one InterAction members are involved in Haiti relief efforts, and about 50 have projects operating there.

1012,European Ministers Push to Increase Target for EU Carbon Emissions,https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/16/eu-carbon-emissions/,2010/07/16,"Ministers from France, Germany and the UK are calling for the EU to cut its carbon emissions by 30% on 1990 levels by 2020, arguing that failure to reach the goal will have long-term economic consequences. The current target is a 20% reduction from 1990 levels.
The officials say increasing the target will help create jobs in clean energy sectors and help keep the EU competitive with China, Japan and the US, each of which is investing in green technology and sustainable energy. The US has set a goal of reducing 2005 greenhouse gas emissions 17% by 2020.
Renewable power sources such as wind and solar made for more than half of all new electricity capacity added in Europe and the US last year, according to a report from the Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century (REN21).
This chart from the European Wind Energy Association that the EU as a whole has been on target to meet its 20% carbon emissions goal, though it might need to ramp things up to reach 30%:
(You can download the original PDF here.)
This is good news for green tech, and supported by the continued growth of sustainable energy investments worldwide, despite the economic downturn.
Update: Some European countries, including Germany and the UK, are raising aviation taxes in response to carbon emission control. Starting in November, Britain may charge a tax of up to £170 per person for long business class flights.

1013,Global Clean Energy Report: China Surpassed U.S. as Top Sector Investor in 2009,https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/15/global-clean-energy-report-un-2009/,2010/07/15,"
The United Nations Environment Program and the Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century today reveal in a pair of new reports that despite an overall financial downturn in 2009, global investments in sustainable energy increased worldwide. Core clean energy investments from private and public sources totaled $162 billion.
Policies that favor the development of a green economy and businesses in the fields of renewable energy and energy efficiency also increased: more than 100 countries enacted some type of policy target and/or promotion policy related to renewable energy by early 2010.
Thirty eight developing nations had policy targets, and 41 developing nations had a policy of promoting renewable energy. Some segments declined, while others shined of course. Highlights from the clean energy 2009 reports follow below.
Shined: ChinaDeclined: United States
China surpassed the United States for the first time as the country with the greatest investment in clean energy.
Shined: U.S. growth in renewable energyDeclined: U.S. growth in traditional energy
Domestic power capacity increased through clean energy sources more than non-renewable sources like coal, gas and nuclear in 2009.
Shined: Rooftop solar photovoltaicsDeclined: Large, utility-scale solar photovoltaics
Investments in large-scale solar photovoltaics dropped dramatically worldwide. Why? The cost of solar PV technology also dropped dramatically. Record investments in small-scale, namely rooftop solar photovoltaics offset that, partly.
Shined: Spending on wind, power storage and electric vehicles in ChinaDeclined: Spending on biofuels (like sugar and corn ethanol) in the U.S., Brazil and Europe
Biofuels saw $18 billion of financial investment worldwide in 2008, but ended up with just $7 billion in 2009.
Shined: Private sector investment in clean energy in Asia and the AmericasDeclined: Private sector investment in green energy in Europe
For the first time, private sector green energy investments in Asia and Oceania, some $40.8 billion in 2009, exceeded that in the Americas, at $32.3 billion. But private sector investment in Europe was down 10% at $43.7 billion.
Shined: Private equity and venture capital investments in power storage and energy efficiencyIn decline: Public, government spending on clean energy
Around the world, venture capitalists and private equity investors spent $4 billion on energy-smart technologies like storage and efficiency. That’s more than they spent on any other clean energy sector in 2009. By spring 2010, government spending on clean energy began to slow, somewhat, thanks to a new phase of the economic downturn, volatility in the market and governments facing pressure to cut their deficit

1014,Direct Deposit Makes Greenbacks Even Greener,https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/15/direct-deposit-green/,2010/07/15,"
Kermit the Frog once sang about the woes of being green, but the tune could be different for businesses.  One simple way to be green is to pay employees using direct deposit.
A company with 300 employees issuing paychecks every other week only via direct deposit would save 121 pounds of paper, 1,159 gallons of wastewater and 45 gallons of gas annually.  Getting rid of paper paychecks would translate to a $19,000 annual savings for a company employing 100 people.
Employees like it, too: A survey by PayItGreen shows that 72% of employees in the US receive their paycheck via direct deposit, though company size has a lot to do with direct deposit use.  Only 40% of small business employees use it, as compared to 86% of employees working for large companies.
PayItGreen claims that 55% of employees using direct deposit find its environmental benefits motivating.  But the convenience of not having to cash a check seems to be a larger motivating factor.  The main reason for not using direct deposit was whether or not the employer offered it.

1015,BP Buys Verenium's Biofuel Business For $98 Million,https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/15/bp-biofuel-verenium-98-million/,2010/07/15,"As oil continues to spill in the Gulf of Mexico, BP is looking towards alternatives such as biofuels. BP announced today that it will acquire the cellulosic biofuels business of Verenium. The $98.3 million deal includes Verenium’s biofuel facilities in Jennings, LA and San Diego, CA.  But it doesn’t include Verenium’s commercial enzyme business, and allows Verenium to develop its own “lignocellulosic” enzyme program.
Verenium focuses on specialty enzymes and biofuels, enabling the production of ethanol from cellulosic biomass, which come from crops such as sugarcane and corn.  When fermented, this biomass can be turned into ethanol.  While conventional ethanol is derived mainly from corn, cellulosic ethanol can be made from a variety of plant waste, as well as industrial processes like paper pulp and sawdust.
The deal will allow BP to distribute cellulosic ethanol at scale, and Verenium to further develop its commercial enzyme business. (One feeds the other).  The two companies will also share intellectual property of newly developed biofuel and enzyme technologies. BP will own 100% of Galaxy Biofulels, a company jointly developed by Verenium and BP.

1016,Feeling Impulsive? Take Brammo's Empulse Electric Motorcycle For A Spin.,https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/15/brammo-empulse-electric-motorcycle/,2010/07/15,"
Brammo‘s electric motorcyle, the Enertia, is about to get some faster, stronger siblings. The company’s new Empulse Trio line will feature bikes that can take you an average of 60, 80 or 100 miles on a full charge at speeds of up to 100 miles per hour. The Enertia, in comparison, can only travel about 40 miles on a full charge.
“We found there was a range anxiety issue with the 40-mile range,” says Brammo CEO Craig Bramscher.
Although the Enertia model has been available for about a year and a half, only a couple hundred are currently on the road. The company is working with a few Best Buy stores in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Portland to sell and service the bikes. Bramscher said he plans to grow the company internationally, especially in Europe and Asia, where the company will soon hire sales and distribution staff.
While the Empulse’s maximum 100-mile range is too low for long distance travelers, it’s adequate for many commutes and everyday driving. It does require a motorcycle license, but most states allow you to test on the bike, so you don’t have to learn to shift gears while maneuvering a cone course. You can also skip regular motorcycle maintenance costs, like engine tuning and oil changes, and stop worrying about gas prices: a full charge will cost you about a buck. If you need a replacement part, the bike’s chain, tires and brakes can be replaced with those of a standard motorcycle.
The bikes’ batteries can be charged either at a Level 2 charging station, or any standard (Level 1) power outlet. “Anywhere you can plug in a laptop, you can plug in the bike,” Bramscher says.
Of course, you’ll need a little patience if you’re plugging it into a regular outlet. A full charge will take about seven to eight hours, in contrast to the two-and-a-half to three-hour charge at a Level 2 charging station—but there aren’t too many of those. If you’re wondering where you might find a Level 2 charging station, Brammo’s got an app for that. The app (initially for the iPhone, with an Android version in the works) will offer a realtime display of nearby charging facilities. The Empluse also features an iPhone port built into the bike.
The Empulse Trio will cost $9,995 for the 6.0, $11,995 for the 8.0 and $13,995 for the 10.0 model with a 100 mile range. All three are eligible for federal and state tax incentives. Brammo is based in Ashland, Oregon and raised $12 million in its August 2008 Series A round. Bramscher is gunning to raise $25 to $30 million for a Series B within the next three months.

Trilliant, a California-based provider of smart grid solutions that enhance energy efficiency, utility operations, and renewable resource integration, this morning announced that it has secured a whopping $106 million in funding from a global syndicate of industry and financial big-names.
The round was led by Investor Growth Capital, VantagePoint Venture Partners, ABB and GE and will reportedly by used to ramp up growth in North America and abroad.
Last time we covered the company was in August 2008, when Trilliant raised $40 million from MissionPoint Capital Partners and zouk ventures, who also participated in this new monster round. Likely, the next step for the company would be to go public.
Trilliant provides hardware, software and real-time Smart Grid communication network solutions around the world, boasting over 200 utility customers today.
Originally founded in 1985, the company now exclusively focuses on providing electric utilities with end-to-end communications networks that span from the head-end operations center to all devices on the grid – not only meters and in-home energy management devices but also substations and grid devices such as transformers and capacitor banks.
The company has just won a contract to build a $200 million smart-meter system for the 610,000 customers of Central Maine Power. It will also expand into Europe via partnerships with Centrica in the UK and ESB in Ireland. With Centrica, Trilliant plans to install 5 million meters in the UK over the next five years.

1018,SolarCity Wins $21.5 Million Funding Round from Mayfield,https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/14/solarcity-funding-july2010-21-5-million/,2010/07/14,"
SolarCity today announced that it is taking a $21.5 million round of funding led by Mayfield Fund, and the company’s previous investors Draper Fisher Jurvetson, DBL Investors and Generation Capital. The company’s prior funding totaled approximately $134 million, and included investors First Solar, JP Morgan and Elon Musk.
SolarCity helps businesses, home owners and government agencies adopt solar power and save money using clean energy versus electricity generated from non-renewables. It designs, installs and provides finance options for the development of solar projects. In 2008, it provided and installed the thousands of solar panels that grace the roof of eBay Inc.’s green building (pictured) in San Jose.
Earlier this week, SolarCity signed a new partnership deal with Rabobank, the international private bank with a triple A credit rating. The bank has agreed to provide solar project financing for its commercial clients via SolarCity. Rabobank N.A. in California also installed solar power generating rooftops at six of its retail locations.
The shiny new Rabobank-SolarCity rooftops provide power not just for the banks themselves, but for customers of another Elon Musk concern — Tesla Motors. AutoBlogGreen gushes that any of Tesla’s electric vehicles making a pit stop along California’s “clean corridor,” or Highway 101 Rabobank locations can get recharged renewably.
SolarCity plans to use its latest round of venture funding to expand into new geographic markets, and entertain acquisitions. Its solar projects, so far, are in five states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Oregon and Texas.
In California and Arizona, SolarCity faces direct competition from SunRun, another venture-backed firm with investments totaling about $140 million, with its most recent round led by Sequoia Capital.

1019,Enphase Energy's Thermostat Lets You Control Your Home's Temperature From Afar,https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/14/enphase-energy-remote-thermostat/,2010/07/14,"
Green data geeks now have another tool for controlling their energy consumption. Enphase Energy‘s new Environ Smart Thermostat lets you control your home’s temperature and monitor your solar installations remotely.
The company is known for its microinverter system, which turns solar-generated DC power into home energy friendly AC power. A microinverter is attached to every solar module, and the unit also monitors the module’s performance and sends out an alert if there is a problem with the module, be it debris or a tree branch that grew large enough to shade the solar panel.
All of the data is transmitted to a website where you can analyze your energy consumption and, with the new thermostat, control your home’s temperature from afar. Want to turn on the AC before your commute home so you can step into a cold house? No problem. You can also turn over control to Enphase, which can help you program your thermostat to meet your energy goals, like letting the temperature rise a few degrees during peak times to save on your energy bill.
“What we want to do is plug a hole on the energy consumption side,” says CEO Paul Nahi.
The thermostat works with Enphase installations and sells for $349. The company began selling solar installations in 2008, and currently has customers in 49 states and all Canadian provinces. Enphase has raised $100 million in funding and although the company won’t release specific figures, Nahi said the company is “financially sound.”

1020,Power Assure Gets $11.25 million Jolt of Funding,https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/14/power-assure-11-25-million/,2010/07/14,"
Power Assure, a Santa Clara green IT company, today announced that it scored $11.25 million in venture funding. The round was led by energy efficiency-focused investors Good Energies, and joined by Point Judith Capital and Draper Fisher Jurvetson.
Power Assure’s chief technology officer Clemens Pfeiffer said the company will use this capital to take its technology to a broader market. Its software cuts data centers’ power consumption by half, on average, the company claims.
Palo Alto Research Center (formerly known as Xerox PARC) uses Power Assure, but Pfeiffer declined to name other major customers.
Founded in 2007, Power Assure took a $2.5 million series A round from DFJ in 2009. It also previously won non-dilutive grant funding including a $5 million grant from the Department of Energy, and a $50,000 cash prize at the 2008 California Clean Tech Open. (In total, the company has raised $18.75 million.)
Power Assure’s software works like “automatic lights out” in homes, Pfeiffer says. “If you have a lot of traffic on your site or a lot of users on your app, then you need to keep a lot of servers in your data center running. During low utilization times  you don’t need them all running. You can use them for other purposes, or in an extreme case sleep or shut them down to save energy and money. That’s just as long as you can adjust the capacity dynamically.”
Companies that have expressed the most interest in using Power Assure’s solutions in 2010 have been government organizations “trying to follow the mandates of the Obama administration,” financial services companies “because of the pressure that they are under to cut costs,” and companies that operate “data centers in the ten- to two-hundred-thousand square feet range,” but may not have achieved the efficiencies of an Amazon or Google yet, according to Pfeiffer.
Jonathan Koomey, a consulting professor at Stanford University whose research focuses in part on the growth and environmental impact of data centers, said it’s a good time to be in the business of green IT services:
“Climate change is becoming a bigger more important part of companies’ risk profiles and planning. And the cost of IT has gone up a lot in the last five years. Computers have gotten cheaper, but things like cooling and power distribution have gotten more expensive to the point where the cost of buying the cooling and backup power is comparable to the cost of a data center’s IT equipment itself. Companies like [Power Assure] can save a lot of money for businesses that use data centers while reducing emissions. That’s a good thing, and a reminder that the net effect of using data centers in a rational, sustainable way — moving bits not atoms — is actually a positive for the environment.”

EcoMotors makes engines that run on diesel or gasoline but have greater power density, weigh less and produce lower carbon emissions than conventional engines. OPOC engines are being developed for passenger vehicles, as well as for commercial vehicles, aerospace and power generators.
According to the company, an OPOC engine:
“operates on the 2-cycle principle, generating one power stroke per crank revolution per cylinder. It comprises two opposing cylinders per module, with a crankshaft between them, and each cylinder has two pistons moving in opposite directions. This innovative design configuration eliminates the cylinder-head and valve-train components of conventional engines, offering an efficient, compact and simple core engine structure”

OPOC engines “reduce the cost of transport without requiring any sacrifices by the consumers,” claims EcoMotors CEO Donald Runkle.
The engines are designed to work with existing infrastructures to easily replace engines like the four-stroke combustible engines used in many passenger cars. They will also be less expensive than these engines. Runkle expects EcoMotors will be able to first implement its engines in applications like gensets and begin putting OPOC engines in cars within two to three years. The company plans to make money through joint development agreements with existing engine manufacturers, licensing its technology and selling its own engines.
Runkle said the investment appealed to Khosla Ventures for its disruptive technology, and to Gates for the engines’ potential applications in developing countries.

When the New York Times wrote an error-filled article, Musk lashed out at the author, saying “What is he doing picking on an electric car company? Why would he pick on the little guy who is trying to do good when you’ve got egregious waste of money in the tens of billions occurring in Detroit?” He added “He’s a huge douchebag…and an idiot.” And that was just when a journalist was poking at Tesla. Get into Musk’s personal life and he’ll take off the kid gloves.
Valleywag’s Owen Thomas, now writing for VentureBeat, has for some reason become fascinated with Musk’s personal life and continues to write about the man’s marital woes. He’s called Musk a liar on multiple occasions and seems delighted to get into the sordid details of Musk’s divorce. Musk wrote his side of things on the Huffington Post. Thomas hit him again.
Musk is now responding yet again, below. What bothers me about this exchange is that Silicon Valley press, VentureBeat in particular, is so focused on an entrepreneur’s personal life. A divorce isn’t anything that our readers want to know about. This isn’t Hollywood and these individuals aren’t out there trying to get lots of press about their personal lives. If they were, they’d hire agents and publicists and make the best of it. Instead they are focused on imagining and building the future. There’s no place in our community for these kinds of attacks. VentureBeat should apologize and move on, and let Tesla continue to disrupt the car industry.
Below is Musk’s response:
Why Owen Thomas is Silicon Valley’s Jayson Blair
The latest article by Owen Thomas, “Tesla CEO can’t handle the truth”, continues his damaging and fraudulent crusade against Tesla and me personally. Tesla has received a great deal of press, both positive and negative, but it is amazing how much of the truly negative press can be traced directly back to one man.
Despite numerous successes at both Tesla and SpaceX, Thomas has never once written a positive article about either company.  Every one of the dozens of stories he has written – without a single exception – has been a nasty hit piece.  Even if all those stories were factually correct, and they certainly were not, he has still fundamentally misled the public about my companies by failing to provide even a token number of positive articles. Lying by omission is still lying.
Responding below under similar headings Thomas uses in his article, I address the inaccuracies in his latest article, where he again lies with great conviction.  It is impossible to stop Owen from continuing to write such erroneous garbage, but, as I do not have the time or inclination to refute all bad reporting on his part, I would like it known that nothing he writes is remotely objective. Any future articles written by Owen Thomas should be viewed with this in mind.
Tesla IPO Filings
Thomas says “Tesla updated its IPO filings to acknowledge substantially all of the concerns we [ie Owen Thomas] raised as potential risk factors investors should consider”.
We updated our IPO filings simply to state that what Thomas had written had no basis in fact.  Since Tesla was in the IPO quiet period, we could not respond directly with a press release.  Instead, we had to update the IPO documents to assure investors that what Thomas had stated about Tesla being reliant on me for funding or there being a DOE loan default risk related to my divorce were both false.
Even without the IPO proceeds, Tesla has enough funding from its many venture investors, Daimler and the DOE to complete the Model S with no financial help from me.  The reason for the IPO was to provide cash for additional new developments and a small percentage of liquidity for long time shareholders, including me (I sold 5% of my holdings).  If this had been a real issue, it would have been placed in the IPO prospectus by the bankers and lawyers long before Owen Thomas raised it.
This is one of many situations where he created a real problem for Tesla out of thin air by writing a misleading article.
My Personal Spending
In his section entitled “Musk’s personal spending”, Thomas does some creative math to claim that one of my “whoppers” is that I suggest I’m spending $30k per month, excluding legal fees.  This is completely made up.  I never state that anywhere in my piece, nor can it be computed from a collection of my other statements.
Thomas intentionally conflates a statement I make about the average of what I’ve been forced to spend on divorce lawyers over the past two years and my household expenses last year, ignoring the fact that a huge portion of the legal expenses occurred this year in the run up to trial.
Founding of Tesla Motors
Here Thomas relates an anecdote about a serious issue Tesla had with Martin Eberhard, one of the cofounders of the company.  Eberhard filed a lawsuit against Tesla (and me) that was filled with inaccuracies.
Tesla was going to file a counter suit, but before we filed, Eberhard and I settled our differences with a few hours of mediation. I’m glad that we made peace.  The result obviously satisfied both Eberhard and me or it wouldn’t have been settled. However, Thomas quotes Eberhard’s lawyer as though this was a one sided victory.  He could just as easily have quoted my lawyer who would have made the same statement.
What Thomas forgets to mention is that Eberhard was forced to withdraw his lawsuit weeks before the mediation even began.  If Eberhard’s position had been strong, he would not have had to withdraw his claims unilaterally well before mediation started.
The Safety of Customer Deposits
Thomas states that I both told customers that I would personally back their vehicle deposits and that I said their deposits were at risk.  He is again intentionally conflating facts to make it sound as though I had contradicted myself.
Here is how Owen Thomas once again misleads the reader: the statements are actually referring to different vehicles at very different stages of maturity, but he pulls each quote out of context and pretends they refer to the same thing.  When I said that I would back customer deposits personally, which I did directly to customers on several occasions as well as in a Car & Driver article, that was clearly and explicitly regarding the Roadster.
I knew that my resources, combined with Tesla’s, would be enough to pay them back personally if need be.  Moreover, Tesla had not been sufficiently clear with customers in the early days that the Roadster deposits were at risk.  It would not be right for customers to have those funds at risk without their explicit consent.
On the other hand, the statement I made to Claire Cain Miller of the New York Times at the Model S launch specifically and clearly referred to the Model S reservations.  I knew that my and Tesla’s resources could not also cover the Model S deposits in a worst case situation.  However, unlike with Roadster, we were very explicit that Model S reservation dollars were at risk and that the funds would be put to use doing advance development of the vehicle.
In this section, Thomas also says that I announced that a Tesla financing round had closed in November 2008, when it actually closed in March 2009.  Whether intentionally or not, he is getting the dates confused between when the financing round documents were signed (representing firm commitments), which was actually December 2008, and when the last of the cash was wired in, which was March 2009.  This is common in complex financial rounds with a large number of participants.
My History as an Entrepreneur
In this section, Thomas casts aspersions on both Zip2 and PayPal, my first two companies, talking about management changes that occurred at both and not acknowledging one positive thing about either company. The reality is that Zip2 (which I started at age 23) sold for over $300M to Compaq and PayPal sold to eBay for over $1.5B after going public. Anyone reading Thomas’s twisted account of their history without knowing better would think that both were failures.
It is worth noting that of the five companies that I’ve been a key part of creating (Zip2, PayPal, SpaceX, Tesla and SolarCity) over the past fifteen years, every round at every company has been an up round, even in the worst of all market conditions.  In other words, no matter whether you were a series A, B, C, D, etc investor, you always made money.  With a public company, there are of course significant short term fluctuations in share price, but those investors that believe in a long term hold strategy should be comforted by this track record.
Thomas also falsely states that I’m alienated from the rest of the management team at PayPal and have a completely different version of history to them. In reality, Peter Thiel, who replaced me as CEO of PayPal, later became one of the biggest investors in SpaceX. Max Levchin (PayPal CTO), Peter Thiel, David Sacks (PayPal COO) and I produced a movie together soon after we worked together at PayPal. There are half a dozen other ventures involving me and several other members of the PayPal management team.
Tesla’s Investors
Thomas references another NY Times Miller article about an email I wrote to customers and claims I said Tesla would start getting DOE funds in four to five months.
What I actually said was that the DOE had told me to expect funds disbursement in four to five months.  This was absolutely true.  In the end, it took the DOE six months longer than they themselves expected, since the ATVM loan program was brand new.
In any event, Thomas bizarrely manages to create a fake negative story out of what was actually a huge victory for Tesla.  We were selected as the first winners of the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing program, along with Ford and Nissan.  One of the requirements of this program was that you had to demonstrate that you were a viable ongoing business and that you had a compelling technology and business model for the funds sought.
This is completely different from the auto bailout program for GM and Chrysler, although many in the media confused the programs.  In fact, the reason that GM and Chrysler were excluded from the ATVM program, is that they were going through bankruptcy and therefore obviously failed the requirement to have a viable ongoing business.
Thomas falsely states that Tesla wasn’t profitable last year, even though I said it would be.  In fact, Tesla was profitable in 2009, albeit only for the month of July.  That’s the best we could do, given the ramp up in Model S expenses, but nonetheless it was an important symbolic victory.  If all Tesla did was focus on being a small sports car company and sell powertrain technology, it would still be profitable today, as both businesses generate a good margin.
However, my goal from the beginning has been to make electric cars that anyone can afford (Model S is step two in that process, not the end game), which requires a huge expansion in production.  We are trying to go from about 500 Roadsters per year to 20,000 Model S vehicles. In other words, production is intended to be 4,000% of what it is today in only a few years time.  There is just no way to remain profitable with that level of growth and capital expenditure.
Regarding Car & Driver quoting me as saying that GE would be an investor, that was an error on my part that was corrected as soon as C&D published.  The C&D interview occurred a few months earlier when GE had confirmed via email that they would be investing.  Then GE had some sort of internal crisis and pulled out at the thirteenth hour (they had asked us to extend the closing deadline to allow them to participate), which was unfortunate for them.  Their investment would have done incredibly well.
Thomas pointedly ignores actual Tesla investors.  In addition to the excellent venture investors of Valor Equity, DFJ, Technology Partners and others, there is Daimler and Toyota.  Daimler invested $50M in Tesla after working with us for a year on the electric Smart car and doing extremely detailed technical and financial due diligence.  When we did another investment round late last year with ADWEA and Fjord Capital, they invested again.  When we did the IPO, they didn’t sell a single share, despite having a roughly threefold return on investment.
The Toyota Deal
Thomas states that although Toyota and Tesla announced that they would be developing a vehicle together, the SEC filings done right after the press conference say that we have no written agreement and there is no guarantee that we will get one done.  Therefore, he concludes that I (and presumably Akio Toyoda), were misleading the public at the press conference!
Thomas actually knows better, but, for those who aren’t familiar with the requirements of an IPO prospectus (aka S-1), you always have to state the worst case scenario.  This is done for liability protection, but is definitely not what is actually expected to occur.
Anyone who thinks that Akio Toyoda, the president of Toyota, would give a major public speech in front of the governor of California about doing a joint electric vehicle project with Tesla and not follow through is a complete fool.  As was announced last week in Japan by Toyota, we have now signed the agreement and will be delivering the first prototypes this month.  The vehicle and details of the program will be unveiled at another event later this year.
Despite Toyota’s recent troubles, they are still the largest car company in the world and by far the leader in hybrid electric vehicles.  For them to have invested in Tesla, (moreover at the IPO price) and want to partner with us to produce a vehicle is a great honor and a powerful endorsement.
Purchasing the NUMMI plant for $42M, which has the ability to manufacture half a million vehicles per year or almost 1% of global automotive production, and making that our Tesla factory is another valuable element of the relationship.  I should mention that NUMMI was owned half by Toyota and half by the General Motors spinoff (Motors Liquidation Corp), so we owe them a debt of appreciation too.
The main reason I love this factory is that it accelerates our ability to produce an affordable mass market car.  The Model S platform will at most consume 50k to 100k of the NUMMI capacity.  The remainder of the plant will be sectioned off until we can bring our high volume affordable electric car to market, which has always been my dream for Tesla.

1025,The Return Of The Blimp . . . As A Green Cargo Carrier,https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/09/blimp-green-cargo-carrier/,2010/07/09,"It’s not news that cargo planes aren’t the greenest way to transport heavy loads, but some companies are working on other ways to send goods through the air. Could blimps make a comeback as a greener cargo carrier?  Speaking to an audience at the World Forum on Enterprise and the Environment in Oxford, England, scientist David King recently predicted that helium-powered ships could be carrying freight within a decade.
It is not as far-fetched as it sounds.  Companies like Lockheed Martin and Boeing have been developing blimps for some time, both for cargo transport and for military operations.
Boeing is working with Canada’s SkyHook International on the JHL-40 or “Jess Heavy Lifter”, a helium-filled airship with helicopter rotor systems that will help lift up attached cargo. The blimp will be designed to carry 40 tons as far as 200 miles before needing to refuel, or 800 miles without cargo and could be in the air by 2014 (assuming it doesn’t get mothballed or canceled before then, as several similar projects have in the past).
Blimps are unlikely to replace most airships, since they travel rather slowly. They could be used, however, to help transport goods to and from remote regions. Some models could have lifts for attaching and removing cargo without touching down, which could enable them to bring goods or humanitarian aid to areas without accessible roads or airports.
Other uses for the Heavy Lifter could be slightly ironic. Boeing and SkyHook plan to target the logging, mining and energy industries, offering a way to be greener by reducing their need to build roads in isolated areas.
It will be interesting to see how these blimps perform. If they succeed, some parts of the world could start looking like a more peaceful version of one of those old airship films.

1026,Solar Powered Toothbrush Cleans Using Electrons,https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/09/solar-powered-toothbrush/,2010/07/09,"
Next time you’re running low on toothpaste, switch to solar power. The Soladey-3 ionic toothbrush from Japan apparently busts plaque with electrons that work with saliva to remove it from your teeth. A solar panel attached to the handle absorbs electrons from light and transmits them to your teeth through ionized water and a titanium oxide semiconductor in the upper shaft of the toothbrush.
According to the Website, “This reaction is not felt by you, but it makes the plaque unstable and easy to remove.”  That is reassuring.
It’s different from most electric toothbrushes, which vibrate and sometimes shoot water at your teeth, but still rely on toothpaste to help remove plaque. You could still use toothpaste, but Soladey claims it loosens plaque effectively using only electrons. And don’t worry, night owls – it works with artificial light, too.
Note: Some people think that the health benefits of ionized water is nothing more than “Snake oil on tap.” Anyone have experience with one of these?

1027,eMeter Smart Grid Software Company Raises $12.5 Million,https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/08/emeter-series-f-funding/,2010/07/08,"
Smart Grid management software producer eMeter announced a $12.5 million Series F round of funding today. The investment comes from Sequoia Capital and Foundation Capital, who have both invested in the company previously, along with Northgate Capital.
The company was founded in 1999 and has raised nearly $70 million in funding. eMeter works with more than a dozen electric, gas and water utility companies which use it to provide detailed usage data to their customers. eMeter is not new to the space and other companies like OPOWER, Silver Spring Networks and Google are also working to secure similar utility company deals.
eMeter will use the funding for sales and marketing, service improvements and new product development. The company recently briefed the White House and Department of Energy on results of the PowerCents DC Program, which used the company’s products to test different pricing models for consumer energy consumption.

1028,Tesla Stock Idling 7 Percent Below IPO Price,https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/07/tesla-stock-down/,2010/07/07,"After a better-than-expected pop on the first day of its IPO, Tesla’s stock (under the ticker symbol TSLA) started to slide a few days after.  It is now hanging 7 percent below its initial pricing of $17, closing at $15.80 per share today.
Only a week on the market, Tesla’s stock has fluctuated greatly, trading at a high of $30.42 and dropping to a low of $14.98. While some hoped Tesla would provide the “Netscape moment” for clean tech IPOs, Tesla seems to have the same struggles other greentech IPOs have experienced. Just last month, commercial rooftop panel maker Solyndra canceled its IPO plans.
Greentech companies often face high production costs and initially low profits, a combination that makes some investors skittish. The industry also receives fewer government subsidies than traditional fuel industries like oil, which continues to receive billions in subsidies.
One wonders whether Tesla’s IPO roller coaster might worry Zipcar. The company filed for a $75 million IPO of its own in early June. Investors who bought at the IPO, as well as partner Toyota which bought $50 million worth of stock in a private placement at the same time, better have a lot of patience.

1029,Web Services for Mother Earth: Living PlanIT's Vision for Data-Driven Cities,https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/07/living-planit-data-driven-cities/,2010/07/07," Steve Lewis wants to use data for good. His company, Living PlanIT, works with hundreds of partners to create sustainable cities and improve business and construction efficiency.
Living PlanIT aims to bring high tech tools to the construction industry to help create sustainable, data-driven cities. We wrote about one such city in Portugal, where each building within the city will be able to plug into the network, tracking everything from water usage to traffic congestion.
Lewis was inspired when he noticed that while many large-scale manufacturing industries like aerospace and automotive had begun using technology to streamline manufacturing efficiencies, the construction industry seemed more focused on design aesthetics.
“We’re a classic tech company,” he says, “we just happen to be building a city.”
Lewis and co-founder Malcolm Hutchinson are Microsoft alumni, and Lewis often uses .NET as an analogy to illustrate how Living PlanIT operates. He sees the company like a web service platform developers (both the coder and brick and mortar types) can tap into to create smarter products.
Although building cities from the ground up is no small endeavor, Lewis says building with the networked sensor technology can be cheaper than retrofitting existing structures. More new cities and collaborations with existing cities are in the works, including Las Vegas.
Businesses within this kind of city could benefit from being tapped into the data grid. A store owner might not care about what technology powers his shop, but he does care about what his customers are doing. With Living PlanIT’s help, the physical space can be built to be interactive, collecting data from sensors and displaying content to customers. Store owners could find out where customers were before they entered the store, what brought them inside and what items they looked at.
The company chose not to take venture capital and makes the most of its money through intellectual property royalties it charges partners, as well as through renting out space in its future cities. Partners pay an annual fee that varies from €100,000 for major players to as low as €5,000 for smaller companies. Cities can serve as incubators, helping bring companies’ technologies to the market and sharing revenue.
Living PlanIT is not yet profitable, but although Lewis declined to share numbers, he said the company expects to break even in the third quarter of next year. 370 companies currently work with Living PlanIT, and Lewis expects the number to grow to 12,000 by the end of 2014. The company currently employs 70 people, planning to grow to 150-200 employees by year’s end.

1030,Obama Shines Light on Solar with $2B Investment,https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/06/2b-for-solar/,2010/07/06," In his weekly address on Saturday, President Obama announced the Department of Energy will loan almost $2 billion to two solar energy companies: Abengoa Solar and Abound Solar Manufacturing.  The loans will go towards developing solar energy plants.
With the funding, Abengoa will build a solar plant in Arizona that can power 70,000 homes. When completed in 2013, the plant will be one of the largest in the world. It will also store part of the energy it produces, becoming the first plant in the U.S. to do so.
Abound will receive $400 million to build two plants, one in Colorado and the other in a former Chrysler factory in Indiana. The funding comes from the Recovery Act, and the plants are expected to create more than 1,500 permanent jobs and at least 2,000 construction jobs.
The loans are part of the President’s policy to use government loans to help jump-start the alternative energy industry.

1031,IBM Dives Back Into Water Cooling Supercomputers To Save Energy,https://techcrunch.com/2010/07/02/ibm-water-cooled-supercomputer/,2010/07/02,"Today, IBM delivered its first Aquasar supercomputer, which is cooled by water, to a Swiss technology institute.  The system needs 40% less energy to run than air-cooled machines, and the waste heat it produces can be used to warm buildings.
The system works thanks to micro-channel liquid coolers that are attached directly to processors, one of the biggest culprits of computer heat generation. IBM says water is 4,000 times more efficient at removing heat than air. In the past, water was commonly used to cool mainframes and other large computing systems, but typically that water was kept at low temperatures.
Interestingly, the water used to cool the Aquasar system is warm, around 140 degrees F. This works because it’s still cool enough to capture enough heat from processors to keep them below their 185 degree F max. The water exits the system at about 149 degrees F, and can be used to heat buildings in which it is hosted.
IBM’s technology could help reduce energy costs to data centers, which use up to 50% of their energy consumption on air cooling systems to prevent processor over-heating. It could also reduce the initial costs of setting up a data center, allowing companies to pay to cool each machine as they’re added instead of needing to cool an entire room regardless of the number of machines in it.

In the second quarter, cleantech venture investments worldwide totaled $2.02 billion across 140 companies, according to market research firm Cleantech Group and Deloitte. The numbers are in line with last quarter’s $2.04 billion, but 43% higher than one year ago.
Exits for the quarter totaled more than $8 billion globally, with $6 billion in cleantech M&A and $2.3 billion in cleantech IPOs.  Tesla‘s $202 million IPO has been in the spotlight recently, but globally, the cleantech IPO market is concentrated in China, which grabbed $1.7 billion, 75 percent of the $2.3 billion raised worldwide in the past three months, and 12 of the 19 IPOs, though not all of those are venture backed.  The biggest IPO of the quarter was China’s Origin Water on the Shenzen Stock Exchange, which raised $330 million.  As a point of comparison, in the U.S. alone, IPOs across all sectors totaled $900 million in the second quarter.

On the M&A front, there were 160 cleantech deals worldwide, including Switzerland’s ABB buying utility enterprise software maker Ventyx for more than $1 billion, and chip company Maxim buying smart-meter chip maker Teridian Semiconductor for $315 million.
In terms of venture funding, the most active cleantech investors in the quarter were Carbon Trust Investment Partners (6 deals), Kleiner Perkins (4 deals), Angeleno Group (3 deals), Draper Fisher Jurvetson (3 deals), and Khosla Ventures (3 deals).  Mega-deals of $100 million or more are on the rise, with four such deals in the quarter, including $175 million for Solyndra, $165 million for Landis+Gyr, $115 million for BrightSource Energy, and $129.4 million for Amonix.
The industry sectors drawing the most dollars were solar, biofuels, and smart grid.  Solar is one of the industry’s brightest shining stars, grabbing $811 million to mark its third highest quarter in history.

Investment in biofuels was also strong, soaring to $302 million since the the first quarter.

Spurred by the recession, investors are spending money on companies that can save money. Energy efficiency boasted 31 rounds of funding, trumping solar’s 26 and biofuels’ 13 deals.

Smart grid investments in particular experienced their highest quarter ever.

Networking equipment maker Cisco intends to build a sustainable city in Portugal. The company will work with Living PlanIT, a startup focused on developing large-scale sustainable technologies for construction projects and cities.
What will this city look like? For one thing, it’ll be wired with tens of millions of sensors providing real-time data to help manage common urban issues like traffic and crime. The 11-square-mile city will host 225,000 residents at a site in Paredes near the less sustainable city of Porto which is heavily populated and could be an example of a city benefiting from having a neighbor designed to be green.
Locals’ homes will use at least 50% less energy and 80% less water than regular city dwellers. And if saving wasn’t enough, the city will import waste from other areas and turn it into amino acid by-products pharmaceuticals can use.
Portugal’s government named the plan a “Project of National Importance,” and other cities, want in on the technology, including Las Vegas.
The project will have 25 phases, the first of which is slated to begin this year, and hopes to attract at least €550m in investments.

The Arlington, VA based company’s 10,000 square foot office in San Francisco’s South Park neighborhood will have room for between 75 and 100 employees, a large part of which will be engineers. “We signed a two-year sublease because we hope to grow out of that space,” says CEO Daniel Yates.
In Partovi, OPOWER is getting an experienced advisor who will help build the company in its plans to grow from 95 to 150 employees total in the coming year.  Partovi co-founded online music service iLike with his brother Ali, which they sold to MySpace, before leaving in April.  Previously, Partovi founded Tellme Networks, which was acquired by Microsoft for a reported $800 million.  Partovi also worked on IE5.
OPOWER provides utility companies with a way to engage customers with easy-to-understand home energy reports designed to inspire them to reduce consumption. OPOWER uses behavioral economics to provide each customer with a personalized analysis of their usage, taking into account their circumstances and lifestyle. 
“Instead of saying ‘you used this many kilowatts’, we say ‘you use 5% less or 20% more than your neighbors,'” says Senior Director of Marketing and Strategy Ogi Kavazovic.
The company has signed on 35 utility companies in 15 states across the country, including seven of the 10 biggest players. Yates says that by the end of this year, OPOWER will be saving more energy than the entire U.S. solar power industry is producing. The company is targeting north of $30 million in annual recurring revenue.

1037,Oil Spill Still Too Slippery To Solve (But Here Are Some Videos),https://techcrunch.com/2010/06/29/oil-spill-ideas/,2010/06/29,"
So far, an estimated 82 million gallons of oil have leaked into the Gulf of Mexico.  Everything BP has tried to stop one of the largest oil spills in history has failed. The company has tried everything from “junk shots” to “top kill” to containment domes, and is still spending $100 million a day to try to cap the well and clean up the mess.  The company is even open to suggestions.
Whether they are submitted to BP or not, lots of smart people are sharing solutions their own solutions.  Below are some of the suggested cleanup solutions, with videos explaining the technologies.
Oil Cleanup Ideas
For instance, actor Kevin Costner (remember Waterworld?) has funded and deployed devices designed to separate oil from water. The separated oil can be reused after it is collected.

Another approach, from Mobius Technologies, uses an oil-absorbing powder to trap oil molecules in a cake-like trap. The company claims it can provide a million pounds of the substance every two weeks, enough to absorb 25,000 barrels of oil. But with oil spilling at a rate of 100,000 barrels per day, this solution alone would be like slapping a band-aid on an amputation.  The other issue would be how to collect the caked-up oil from the surface of the ocean—perhaps with a fleet of boats dragging huge skimmers.

Texas Tech’s Fibertect wipe slurps up oil from water surfaces, and possibly oil-drenched animals as well.  But again, how many yards of this cloth would be needed to make a difference and is trawling an effective clean-up method?

One proposed solution is using oil-eating Oyster Mushrooms to gobble up oil that washes up on the shore:

While these ideas hold promise for helping to clean up the mess, it doesn’t plug the gushing pipe. Some are discussing ways to stop the spillage on independent forums and media sites, while others illustrate concepts with animations for a conical stopper:

and freezing the oil with liquid nitrogen to weld the pipe shut:

Brad Feld of the Foundry Group in Boulder, Colo. wants to see brilliant minds inspired by this quick-thinking solution from the movie Apollo 13 (“Let’s build a filter”):

Feld proposes gathering the smartest MIT students for a massive brainstorming session.

1038,Homerun For SunRun: Sequoia Capital Leads $55 Million Financing,https://techcrunch.com/2010/06/29/sequoia-capital-sunrun/,2010/06/29,"One thing home solar startup SunRun doesn’t seem to have a problem with is getting access to lots of capital. The three year old company has now raised $85 million in venture capital – including a new $55 million round led by Sequoia Capital. Previous investors Accel Partners and Foundation Capital also participated in the round.
But that’s not all. The company also has $90 million from US Bancorp and $100 million from PG&E to finance home solar installations.
At its core SunRun is a finance company. They offer attractive solutions to home owners to add solar panels to their roof, or in their yard. Customers can choose to pay up a single up front fee for the systems – which average around $25,000 – or pay nothing up front and make monthly payments over the decades-long useful life of the system. Either way customers are likely to save money versus their normal grid electricity largely thanks to federal tax credits and state and local incentives to go solar.
Most states allow solar users to sell excess electricity back to the grid, decreasing costs further. During the day you sell your electricity back to the utility, and in the evening you take some of that electricity back. That also reduces the need for costly batteries to store energy as its produced.
SunRun is one of the leading companies in home solar with around 17% market share. They have 5,000 customers in California, Colorado, Arizona, Massachusetts and New Jersey. They’ll eventually launch in other states as energy prices increase and/or state and local incentives become more widely available.
I spoke to CEO Edward Fenster yesterday about the company and the solar market in general. He says on average customers reduce their electricity costs by around 2/3 if they go solar.  As energy costs rise, the attractiveness of solar will only increase. And for their part, Sequoia Capital partner Warren Hogarth says that SunRun “puts solar within reach of the average American home owner.”

1039,Tesla Prices IPO At $17 Per Share,https://techcrunch.com/2010/06/28/tesla-prices-ipo-at-17-per-share/,2010/06/28,"Electric car manufacturer Tesla is pricing its IPO at $17 per share, according to a release issued this evening. We just wrote today that one day before its scheduled IPO, Tesla Motors increased the allotment of shares that will be sold to the public from 11.1 million to 13.3 million, according to an amendment to its S1 filing.
The $17 pricing per share is well above the expected range of $14 to $16. With the pricing, the electric car maker will debut with a $1.5 billion market cap (based on 93.5 million total shares outstanding after the IPO and a concurrent $50 million private placement with Toyota). Of the shares in the offering, 11,880,600 shares are being offered by the company and 1,419,400 shares are being offered by selling stockholders.
Tesla has already raised $783 million in venture capital and government loans.  Tesla is expecting to raise about $210 million in the IPO, bringing the total raised to just over $1 billion.
Tesla’s stock will start trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol TSLA tomorrow morning.

1040,Tesla CEO Elon Musk To Sell Nearly One Million Personal Shares At IPO,https://techcrunch.com/2010/06/28/tesla-ipo-musk-shares/,2010/06/28,"

One day before its scheduled IPO, Tesla Motors is increasing the allotment of shares that will be sold to the public from 11.1 million to 13.3 million, according to an amendment to its S1 filing.  The additional shares are being sold by existing shareholders looking to cash out at the IPO, including Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk who is selling an additional 909,212 of his personal shares.  Other selling stockholders include VantagePoint Venture Partners (238,748 shares), Bay Area Equity Fund (88,586), Westly Capital Partners (72,625), Compass Venture Partners (22,931), as well as friends and family like Elon’s brother (and OneRiot CEO) Kimball Musk (12,692).  Tesla itself won’t make any additional money from the bump in shares, but more shares will be available to the public.
If Tesla shares open at the high end of its expected range of $14 to $16, the Silicon Valley electric car company will debut with a $1.5 billion market cap (based on 93.5 million total shares outstanding after the IPO and a concurrent $50 million private placement with Toyota).  After the offering, Tesla’s largest shareholder will still be founder Elon Musk, who will own 28.4 percent of the company (worth $426 million at that valuation, versus a potential windfall of $14.5 million for the shares he is selling).  The second largest shareholder will be Daimler (through an investment arm called Blackstar Investco) with 8 percent of the shares, and the third largest will be the government of Abu Dhabi (through Al Wahada Capital Investment) with 7.8 percent of the shares.  The two biggest VC shareholders will be Vantage Capital Partners with 6.6 percent and Valor Equity Partners with 5.25 percent.

It takes a ton of money to crack into the car business.  Even before the IPO proceeds, Tesla has already raised $783 million in venture capital and government loans.  Tesla is expecting to raise about $210 million in the IPO, bringing the total raised to just over $1 billion.
And so far the company isn’t making any money.  Last year, Tesla lost $56 million on revenues of $112 million.  In the March quarter of 2010, it lost $29.5 million on revenues of $20.8 million.  As of March 31, 2010, the company still had $188 million in cash.  But it expects to spend up to $125 million this year, as it gears up to manufacture its Model S sedan (including $42 million to buy a factory in Fremont, California formerly operated by Toyota and GM).
While Tesla is known for its sexy roadster, it the Model S which will make or break the company.  It is a more affordable electric sedan which the company hopes will start to make inroads with the general car-buying public.

1041,When Social Media Becomes The Message: The Gulf Oil Spill And @BPGlobalPR,https://techcrunch.com/2010/06/26/bp-pr-bpglobalpr/,2010/06/26,"
Photo by Fibonacci Blue
Nearly everyone has something to say about BP’s oil spill, and from a public relations perspective, the company is floundering.  Both its stock price and brand value have taken a deepwater dive, and it is struggling to make its own voice heard.
When you Google “BP PR” or “BP public relations,” the top organic result is @BPGlobalPR, a parody account on Twitter with more than 175,000 followers.  In contrast, BP’s official account, @BP_America, has only 15,000 followers.  The satirical @BPGlobalPR is dominating the online conversation. It is an object lesson in how social media can shape and control a company’s message during a crisis.  The fake account has gone viral for its scathing impersonations of the company with tweets like:

We are doing everything we can to stop the information leaks in the gulf: http://ow.ly/22XTw #bpcares (tweet)
Congrats to BP’s Mother of the Year 2010! It’s just oil people! Take the kids out and enjoy the beach! http://ow.ly/232ua (tweet)
Lightning struck one of our ships!  Come on Planet Earth, what did we ever do to you?!? (tweet)
It’s hurricane season now. Don’t worry! We’ve planned for that just as well as we’ve planned for everything else! (tweet)


Some people think it is real.  BP initially wanted to shut down the sardonic account, but Twitter’s policy allows for parody accounts, so long as they don’t mislead or deceive. BP demanded the impostor rewrite his bio, and he did, but not without commentary: “We are not associated with Beyond Petroleum, the company that has been destroying the Gulf of Mexico for 52 days.” It’s since reverted to the original “This page exists to get BP’s message and mission statement out into the twitterverse!”
While BP tried assuaging public anger with a video featuring CEO Tony Hayward apologizing into the camera and promising “we’ll make this right,” it was mostly seen as a failed public relations stunt. It was probably a good idea for Hayward to try to address the public directly, but his presentation felt forced. The video itself was highly produced and likely expensive, as were the TV commercial slots in which it aired.
Meanwhile, anybody can start a Twitter account.  Companies can no longer rely on buying media time to spread their message though well-produced commercials, especially when the disaster your company is responsible for is ongoing.   It doesn’t help when more candid comments like Hayward’s “I’d like my life back” cast doubt on the polished message’s sincerity.  Someone on Twitter or elsewhere on the Web  will find ways to challenge the message, as @BPGlobalPR is doing.  Even mainstream news organizations that are watched by non-tweeters have reported the buzz around the satire account.
Of course, BP’s attempts to bolster its image go well beyond TV spots.  BP also bought paid search terms on several search engines to promote their official site. All of these PR efforts, totalling $50 million by some estimates, are predictable moves to stay engaged in the social media services where BP is being most criticized. The company is using many tools, including Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and YouTube to spread their message. Satire aside, independent groups have set up their own sites, like BP Complaints, which chronicles oil spill news and activism.
The problem isn’t a lack of involvement, it’s a lack of credibility. No amount of PR can help it at this point until it stops the leak and starts cleaning up the ocean.  But while BP struggles to find its story, others are telling it for them.

1042,Boston-Power Recharges With $60 Million Funding For Lithium-Ion Batteries,https://techcrunch.com/2010/06/25/boston-power/,2010/06/25,"
Better batteries may be on the way as lithium-ion battery producer Boston-Power ramps up its manufacturing and R&D with a $60M Series E round from Foundation Asset Management and Oak Investment Partners.  Boston-Power produces Sonata, better known as Hewlett-Packard’s Long Life Battery, as well as Swing, which is used to power electric vehicles including the upcoming ZE Saab 9-3.
The company plans to double its workforce, adding sales and marketing staff in Massachusetts and growing its manufacturing centers in Taiwan.
Founder and CEO Dr. Christina Lampe-Önnerud said the funding will help Boston-Power meet global market demands. Currently, the company can’t produce batteries fast enough to compete with more established players like Sony and Panasonic.
Venrock and Gabriel Venture Partners, who previously invested in the company, also contributed to this round, bringing Boston-Power’s fundraising to $185 million since 2005. Most recently, the company raised $55 million in January.

1043,Is the Next Prius Going To Be A Tesla?,https://techcrunch.com/2010/05/20/is-the-next-prius-going-to-be-a-tesla/,2010/05/20,"
Toyota and Tesla announced a new partnership at Tesla’s headquarters in Palo Alto today, the auto makers will collaborate on technology, the development of new electric vehicles and Toyota will purchase $50 million of Tesla’s common stock (to be completed after Tesla’s pending IPO). The press conference featured the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tesla CEO, Elon Musk and TMC President, Akio Toyoda.
Calling it an “explosion” for California (I think he meant this in the positive sense, not the Terminator sense) Schwarzenegger framed it as a victory for California’s environmental agenda and the economy. He predicts it will create 1,000 jobs for the state’s embattled economy.
“Toyota is a company founded on innovation, quality, and commitment to sustainable mobility. It is an honor and a powerful endorsement of our technology that Toyota would choose to invest in and partner with Tesla,” Musk said in a statement. “We look forward to learning and benefiting from Toyota’s legendary engineering manufacturing, and production expertise.” The car companies will collaborate on future EV models, as Tesla move towards more affordable models. Musk told us he hopes to create a car in the $30,000 price range in the next few years (with Toyota’s help)— compare that to the roadster which retails for $100k-plus.
Significantly, Tesla announced that it will takeover the New United Motor Manufacturing Inc (NUMMI) plant in Fremont and expects to produce the Model S EV at that location, starting in 2012. The NUMMI, which was formerly a joint venture of Toyota and GM, was shut down in April, leading to the elimination of 4,700 jobs. The hope is that once production truly ramps up for the Model S, Tesla will produce 20,000 EVs from the plant (Musk predicts it will take roughly 12 months, from the beginning of production, to reach this level).  The company is currently adding 50 employees per month to keep pace with the expansion that will likely accelerate in the coming months. Over the next few years, he says it’s reasonable to expect Tesla to grow to 2,000 employees, with roughly half of that working in NUMMI.
Earlier today, Schwarzenegger unexpectedly announced (at a separate Google event in Mountain View ) that Toyota was partnering with Tesla to build electric cars in California, according to reports. The possibly accidental announcement took some thunder out of Tesla’s 5 p.m. PST press conference.
For Toyota, it’s a chance to curry favor in the California and larger US market, for Tesla, the car maker gets Toyota’s technology & resources to help it transition from a highly niche player to a more robust force in the domestic auto market. Succinctly: Tesla wants to be more like Toyota, and Toyota wants to be more like Tesla. Musk says the partnership was borne out of a meeting with Toyoda roughly six weeks ago. Musk offered Toyoda a test drive in a Tesla and Toyoda eagerly took him up on his offer—Musk was impressed by the executive’s bold driving skills (“he drove it like a real sports car”) and Toyoda was impressed by the car.
Of course, this is not Tesla’s first partnership with a big automaker. Last year, the company signed a deal with Daimler that gave Daimler a 10% stake and technology in exchange for roughly $50 million, according to reports. Musk said Daimler has been supportive of the new deal and had previously acknowledged that Tesla could use another large partner.
Tesla hasn’t had a lot of trouble attracting capital, with investors like Google’s Sergey Brin, Larry Page, Capricorn Management, Compass Technology, JPMorgan— it’s a really long list. Even the US Deparment of Energy threw down a $465 million low-interest loan for Tesla last year. Attracting money is one thing, the real struggle for Tesla has been  building on that base. The company has recorded net losses for virtually every previous quarter—investors should expect further losses until Tesla really ramps up production and deliveries of its more affordable Model S sedan.

1044,"John Doerr On Bloom Energy Launch: ""This Is Like The Google IPO""",https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/24/doerr-bloom-energy-google-ipo/,2010/02/24,"

After eight years of operating in quasi-stealth, Bloom Energy came out with a bang today at an event in Silicon Valley attended by Arnold Schwarzenegger, Colin Powell, Larry Page, John Doerr, and executives from eBay, Walmart, Coca-Cola, and FedEx.  All of the big-name companies, including Google, are beta customers of Bloom’s distributed energy fuel cell technology (which was the subject of a 60 Minutes profile on Sunday and various other stories since then).
Doerr, the Kleiner Perkins VC who backed both Bloom and Google, said today: “This Is Like The Google IPO.”  Except without the IPO part.  Doerr was referring to the fact that, like Google, Bloom has kept its business close to its vest until it actually could show some progress in terms of customers and products.  Five Bloom energy boxes about the size of a parking space each now provide 15 percent of the power at eBay’s campus.  Walmart is testing the boxes in two locations where it is carrying 60 to 80 percent of the energy load of an entire store.  Google co-founder Larry Page calls the technology a “very big deal” and looks forward to the day that it can expand the number of Bloom boxes Google uses to the point where it can power one of its data centers.
Bloom founder and CEO KR Sridhar, who got his start designing technologies for NASA that would allow humans to live on Mars, explained how Bloom’s fuel cell technology works.  It takes almost any fuel from ethanol to biomass and turns it into electricity.  Fuel cells are nothing new, but Bloom has figured out a way to make them cheaply and efficiently.  A Sridhar claims that a Bloom box, which he calls an energy server, is twice as efficient as the electricity grid.  “For the same amount of electricity, you need half the fuel,” he says.  “If you use a renewable fuel you are carbon neutral. Use all the electricity you want and don’t feel guilty about polluting the environment.”

Each fuel cell, which is made from sand essentially (zirconium oxide), is a square wafer about the size of a CD box.  Each wafer can produce about 25 watts of energy, enough to power a lightbulb. Stack them together and you get a box that could power a house.  Group them into larger units, and you get enough energy to power a building or an entire campus.  He calls them energy servers because they are modular like servers in a data center. Need more energy?  Add more boxes.
They are like backyard generators. No electricity is lost through distribution, and they can convert a variety of fuels into electricity, allowing customers to use whatever is locally available or cheapest.  There are no moving parts, vents, or discharge other than heat.
Right now, only businesses and large facilities can afford these things.  They cost about $750,000 for a 100 kilowatt system (Google is using a 400 kilowatt systems to power one building on its campus, and the Walmart stores are also using 400 kilowatt systems).  Nevertheless, Bloom says the systems should pay for themselves within three to five years because of lower electricity costs.  A typical electricity cost for commercial customers is 8 to 10 cents per kilowatt-hour versus 13 cents for what they might pay a California utility.  That 3 to 5 cents per kilowatt-hour in savings adds up if you are running a huge retail store or a data center.
The costs should come down over time to the point where Bloom boxes really can be used in homes. One potentially disruptive feature of the technology is that it works both ways: fuel can produce electricity, but it can also go the other way so that electricity produces fuel.  Sridhar foresees the killer app for his technology becoming practical in about a decade: a Bloom home energy server combined with solar panels or some other renewable energy.  The electricity from the solar panels could produce fuel, which can be used to produce electricity to power the house or even to gas up your (modified) car.
Dreams like those are the kind that fuel something else: big IPOs. When’s the real one, Doerr?

1045,"The Future Of Energy? Bloom Energy Boxes Already Power Google, eBay, Others",https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/22/bloom-energy-boxes/,2010/02/22,"
Over the past several years, there’s been no shortage of talk about alternative energy, and its potential to change the world. The problem is that most of it is just that — talk. But tonight, a report that aired on 60 Minutes showed one alternative that is not only real, it’s already being tested by companies such as Google and eBay. You simply have to watch this.
Bloom Energy are producing tiny fuel cell boxes they call “Bloom Boxes.” Two of these can apparently power a U.S. home (and only one for homes in countries that use less power). So how small are they? Look at the picture above, each device isn’t much bigger than a standard brick. Of course, they need to be surrounded by a larger unit that takes in an energy source (such as natural gas). But still, these units look to be about the size of a refrigerator and can easily fit outside of a home, providing it with clean, cheap energy.
Currently, these boxes cost some $700,000-$800,000, but eventually, founder K.R. Sridhar envisions one in every home — and he thinks he can get the cost below $3,000 for a unit to make that happen. And he’s talking a 5 to 10 year timeframe for this.
Naturally, there are plenty who are skeptical of something like this ever working. There have been no shortage of fuel cell ideas over the years, but none get their own segment on 60 Minutes showing working units. And none get to highlight the fact that they’re already installed at companies like Google, eBay, FedEx and others. In fact, four of these Bloom Boxes have apparently been powering a Google datacenter for the past 18 months. eBay says their five boxes have saved them over $100,000 in electricity costs over the past nine months.
Bloom Energy also has former Secretary of State Colin Powell on its board of directors, and he talked up the Bloom Boxes on 60 minutes tonight also. And the company has something in the neighborhood of $400 million in funding from the likes of Kleiner Perkins and others. Kleiner’s John Doerr is also featured heavily in the 60 Minutes segment, talking about why he thinks this company can change the world perhaps even in a more profound way that another company he backed, Google, has. Bloom Energy was Kleiner’s first green tech investment.
Again, just watch the video and decide for yourself whether to be skeptical or amazed at this point. Right now, I’m definitely in the latter camp considering this thing is already being tested out. Apparently, Bloom Energy is due for a big formal public unveiling on Wednesday in San Jose (they have a countdown up on their site) —expect to hear a lot more then.

1046,One Block Off the Grid Raises $5 Million,https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/10/one-block-off-the-grid-raises-5-million/,2010/02/10,"One Block Off the Grid, a company that helps residents get competitive group pricing for solar panel installation, has raised a $5 million series A round of venture capital from New Enterprise Associates. The company has gotten pretty far without formal venture cash—facilitating more than 600 installations in 2009, most of that in the fourth quarter. 1BOG, as it’s called, hopes to install five-to-ten times that amount this year, so that NEA cash will help the company hire and grow.
Think of 1BOG like another NEA investment, Groupon, but focused on solar panels. The site groups together customers in large metro areas interested in having panels installed and helps get them the best price. Only one could argue there’s a much bigger need for IBOG than Groupon. Most people don’t know where to start if they want to install solar panels and have no idea how to compare bids between contractors. On average, 1BOG saves customers 15%. And, of course, there’s the whole getting-us-off-foreign-oil/saving-the-planet benefit to 1BOG.
The UI is impressive. You enter your address and it pulls up an aerial view of Google maps. You pick your roof, outline where you want the panels and get a few detailed options including cost, leasing options, local rebates, added value to the house and how much time the panels will take to pay for themselves. Prices and the benefits of solar can vary wildly depending on where you live, local subsidies, what you pay for electricity now, and how much sun you get. “There are some areas where the economics for solar are mindblowing, but no one knows it,” says Dave Llorens, 1BOG’s CEO.
This is less a company saving the world, and more of a company that helps people who talk a good game about saving the world actually go through with it. And that’s the key. While solar investments are down more than 60% in the last year, lean companies that can help bring on the tipping point in adoption have a much better shot at getting some cash.
Speaking of big talk about changing the world, the company is a spin out from Virgance, which we’ve written about before here. In previous articles, Virgance’s founder Steve Newcomb described the company as a startup that would release “Activism 2.0 campaigns” much like EA releases blockbuster games. That model seems to have evolved. Now, he talks about the company in terms of an incubator that helps create and spin-out low-cost companies that will help make the world a better place.
This isn’t a non-profit. The focus is just on greed-based, high-growth companies that will also “do good.” So far, Virgance has four in its stable, and Newcomb is trying to figure out whether there’s a way to scale that up to 40. He doesn’t yet know if that’s feasible, but if it is, expect him to raise a big venture round too.

1047,Tesla Motors' Next VP of Manufacturing Is A Toyota (Veteran),https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/03/tesla-motors-next-vp-of-manufacturing-is-a-toyota-veteran/,2010/02/03,"Right off the heels of filing for a $100 million IPO, electric car company Tesla Motors this morning announced that it has hired former Toyota production engineering GM Gilbert Passin to lead the company’s vehicle manufacturing operations as Vice President of Manufacturing.
Passin has 23 years of international automotive experience under his belt, most recently serving as general manager of production engineering for Toyota in North America.
Previously, Passin was vice president of manufacturing at Toyota’s plant in Cambridge, Ontario, which produces over 200,000 automobiles per year.
Passin regards his jump as a ‘once-in-a-lifetime opportunity’.
In a statement, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Passin’s recruitment fits in the company’s plans to significantly ramp up its production capacity (at present, it has produced some 1,000 cars), particularly with respect to the planned Model S sedan. Musk added that his new VP will also help recruit new employees for Tesla’s California manufacturing team.

1048,Will China Eat America's Lunch in Cleantech?,https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/30/will-china-eat-americas-lunch-in-cleantech/,2010/01/30,"In the State of the Union Address last Wednesday, President Obama said “the nation that leads the clean energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy and America must be that nation.”  At the same time, on the other coast, 75 clean energy investors, entrepreneurs, and researchers were debating whether the U.S. can gain this leadership position.  They agreed that even though Silicon Valley leads the world in technology, it is not clear if it will ever lead in Cleantech. The Valley may develop some breakthrough technologies, but without government help these are unlikely to translate into global leadership. The technology world is rightfully allergic to government assistance and intervention. Cleantech is different, however, and we aren’t dealing with a level global playing field.
The Knowledge Economy Institute Leadership Summit, which I attended, was held at the Joint BioEnergy Institute (JBEI), in Emeryville, California. The question posed: what will it take for the U.S. to achieve global leadership in the clean-energy economy? The group concluded that the U.S., by far, has the strongest innovation platform in the world. But other countries may well reap the benefits of its research efforts. China, in particular, is making massive investments and has a huge advantage from focused policy and large markets.  Even though China is not likely to produce its own innovation, it will continue to appropriate U.S. technology and gain a major advantage by combining this with its manufacturing prowess.  American firms which are increasingly choosing to build design and manufacturing operations in China will provide it with additional advantage.
What will it take for America to lead? Despite decades of dominance in technology innovation, America has a dilemma in the clean-energy economy. Most entrepreneurs aren’t getting the support needed, and we are unable to translate research discoveries in our universities into profitable businesses that attract high levels of investment, make lots of money through manufacturing, and create jobs.
There are two problems with university research – the system for commercializing discoveries doesn’t work well, and there is no clear path-to-market for new technologies which do make it out the door. I’ve written about these problems and I prescribed some workarounds. JBEI is a bold experiment to fix some of these problems the right way. It brings together researchers from different disciplines with business. And it has a practical focus on solving real-world problems.
Centers like JBEI may produce major breakthroughs in technology. But that is when the next set of problems kick in both for university research and for entrepreneurs – clean energy is different than other technologies.  Startups typically need hundreds of millions of dollars to develop and scale up technologies.  Investors don’t see steady, strong and growing markets. So, few are taking the risks and making the big investments.
U.S. policy is not as aggressive as other countries in creating sustainable markets, investing in commercialization, or promoting manufacturing.  Take, for example, Japan’s Sunshine Project and related initiatives that have consistently driven that country’s clean-energy policy since 1974.  Japan has succeeded in building infrastructure, markets, and technology companies that help meet national energy security goals for the long-term.  The U.S. has not.
Contrast this with how U.S. government responded to challenges to its semiconductor industry by rallying behind it and keeping a significant value piece here.  How do we keep our innovative clean-energy companies and their design and manufacturing operations in America?
We need to learn from other countries.  In industries like Cleantech, success depends upon consistent and reliable government policy that links market supply and demand over the long-term.  U.S. policy has been cyclical, unilaterally focused on petroleum, and unrealistic about the value of short-term subsidies and support.  American startups suffer from inconsistent pricing-signals that make investors wary.  As investment cycles wax and wane, small companies lose top talent and are unable to recruit it back when funding begins to flow with the next cycle upturn.
Policy makers need to look at things that affect pricing. Energy is a commodity and it is all about cost.  The energy sector is undifferentiated.  Startups compete with large incumbent firms.  Moreover, clean-energy technology often has a deceptive fit with current industry and markets.  Take biofuels, for example. The high ratio of bulk-to-fuel, distributed biomass sources, and inherent chemical variation dictate smaller-scale and more regional patterns of development and deployment than for petroleum.
Consumers are key.   Consumer perceptions of energy prices have potent effects on the market.   China figured this out.  In addition to subsidizing manufacturing, it is training thirty thousand salespeople to sell new clean technologies to consumers. In the U.S. energy is just too cheap, so consumers don’t see the benefits of Cleantech. Rebates and short-term subsidies just aren’t creating long-term demand. As a result, entrepreneurs trying to build companies on energy efficiency are finding it hard to stay afloat.  The demand and growing markets are just not there.
Will America meet President Obama’s call for global leadership in the clean energy economy?  Not likely if Congress and state governments don’t make it a lot easier for startups to attract investment and a lot more attractive to manufacture here.  Governments need to coordinate comprehensive, long term energy policy – now.

1049,Tesla's $100M IPO: Losses Expected Until At Least 2012. Musk Taking $1 A Year.,https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/29/teslas-100m-ipo-losses-expected-until-at-least-2012-musk-taking-1-a-year/,2010/01/29,"
Electric car company Tesla Motors has filed for a $100 million IPO. There were rumors recently floating around that the company, which is led by PayPal co-founder Elon Musk, would go public “soon.” One interesting tidbit from the filing: Musk only takes $1 in yearly salary.
Another interesting factoid: In the filing, Tesla states that it has seen net losses in each quarter since inception. The company expects to continue on the same path until it starts to deliver larger quantities of its Model S sedan, which is not expected until 2010 or later. Tesla took a loss in the first three quarters of 2009 of $31.5 million which is less than its loss for the same period in 2008, which was $57.3 million. Gross profit for the first three quarters of 2009 was $7.8 million compared to $561K for the same period in 2008. Sales for the first three quarters of 2009 topped out at $93.4 million. As of last December Tesla had sold 937 Tesla Roadsters in 18 countries. The company also saw a total of $108.2 million in revenue since its inception in 2003 until September of last year.
Tesla claimed profitability in August of last year, reporting at the time that it made “approximately $1 million of earnings” on revenues of $20 million, and that it shipped 109 Roadsters, its $109,000 all-electric sports car. Although the company took a loss for the first three quarters of 2009, we are assuming that Tesla may have posted a profit in the fourth quarter, which is why the company claimed profitability last year.  In June, Tesla was also awarded a $465 million loan from the Department of Energy, which will help it manufacture its more reasonably priced Modern S sedan.
The company went through a bit of a scandal with a scathing law suit filed against Tesla Motors and Elon Musk by co-founder and former CEO Martin Eberhard, which was eventually dropped. Last year, Daimler also took a 10% (or $50 million) stake in Tesla, putting the company’s then valuation at $500 million.

1050,Better Place Raises $350 Million To Make This World A Better Place,https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/25/better-place-350-million-funding/,2010/01/25,"I’ve been quite fascinated by electric car firm Better Place since I read up on how the company was founded by former SAP executive Shai Agassi in the excellent book ‘Start-up Nation’, which tells of Israel’s historical entrepreneurial DNA and tech success stories.
Basically, Better Place aims to reduce global dependency on petroleum through the creation of a market-based transportation infrastructure that supports electric vehicles, relying on renewable energy from solar arrays and wind farms instead of oil. The startup, founded just 2 years ago, is currently building its first electric vehicle network in Israel, and plans to deploy the infrastructure in other nations on a country-by-country basis with initial deployments beginning this year, and commercial sales beginning in 2012.
As of April 2009, it had already raised $400 million, with several countries offering tax breaks in favor of the ambitious venture. This morning, Better Place announced that it has raised a massive $350 million follow-up venture funding round to lay the groundwork for these deployments, valuing the company at a whopping $1.25 billion.
HSBC led the round with a $125 million capital injection (buying them approx. 10% of the company), with eight other investors participating, including Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Lazard Asset Management, Israel Corp., VantagePoint Venture Partners, Ofer Hi-Tech Holdings and others.
Better Place says it intends to expand into markets where the business model economics and investor returns are “optimized”, citing Europe and Asia specifically. The company also reaffirmed its original target to begin full commercial operations at the end of next year, when industry partner Renault plans to offer the first car with a replaceable battery.

1052,Zero Motorcycles Kicks It Into Gear With $5.5 Million Series A,https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/05/zero-motorcycles-kicks-it-into-gear-with-5-5-million-series-a/,2010/01/05,"
California-based Zero Motorcycles has taken $5.56M in a Series A add-on according to an SEC filing, filed today. Investors in this round were not disclosed. The company previously raised $5M in April of 2008, bringing their total funding to just over $10.6M. Formerly Electricross, Zero Motorcycles specializes in high performance electric street and dirt bikes–the Tesla of the motorcycle industry so to speak.
Update: We were contacted again by Zero Motorcycles and told that the leading investor in this round was Invus. We were also told that they were the leading investor in the April 2008 round.
CEO Gene Banman tells us the purpose of the funding is to “expand the business.” He declined to expand upon that statement. Given the emerging sector and the influx of competitors, it seems Zero is simply trying to stay ahead of the curve.
The bikes build by Zero are quite impressive. They are zero emissions vehicles, completely non-toxic, silent, almost 100% recyclable, and get the equivalent of 455 miles per gallon. Due to these accolades, Zero bikes are eligible for a 10% Federal tax credit thanks to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Unfortunately, The range (60 miles) and top speed (60 MPH) on a complete four hour charge, leave much to be desired.
While the bikes themselves are reportedly silent, Zero has been making quite the roar in the press as of late. They stated their intention to be a part of the 2010 TTXGP, a grand prix for electric vehicles, with a motorcycle based off of their street bike, the Model S (pictured above). In October of last year, Zero voluntarily recalled 200 of their dirt bikes due to a safety hazard arising when the throttle of the bike would stick, causing unexpected acceleration.
It will be interesting to see how these bikes continue to do in comparison to traditional bikes given that gas powered motorcycles are capable of much higher speeds and distance. However, if Tesla’s recent profitability is any indication of the high performance electric-vehicle sector in general, then Zero could well be on its way to success. Continued investment in the company can’t hurt either.

1053,Venture Funding Roared Back In the Fourth Quarter To Nearly $15 Billion,https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/03/venture-funding-fourth-quarter-2009-15-billion/,2010/01/03,"
After a year when venture funding was in the doldrums, it roared back in the fourth quarter of 2009 to nearly $15 billion, according to a tally of the venture rounds in CrunchBase.  The total value of disclosed fundings for the quarter was $14.85 billion, up 113 percent from a year ago (when the total was $6.96 billion), and up 78 percent from the third quarter of 2009 ($8.35 billion).
Some of the big funding rounds of the quarter included Zynga’s $180 million, Playdom’s $43 million, and RockYou’s $50 million.  But clean tech cleaned up even more, with Horizon Wind Energy bringing in $318 million in financing, Silver Spring Networks adding $105 million to its coffers, and Sun Run Generation raising $90 million.
While the quarter saw a robust return to higher levels of investing, it was not enough to counterbalance the previous three quarters of tepid investing.  The total amount of capital deployed over the full year of 2009 was $32.6 billion, which was lower than the $38 billion total for 2008.  The first two quarters of 2008 were relatively healthy, with $11.5 billion and $11.8 billion raised in venture rounds, respectively.  It wasn’t until third quarter of 2008 that the bottom really fell out.  Venture capitalists kept their purse strings tight until the third quarter of 2009, when they started to ease them open
The total number of funding rounds increased 51 percent sequentially between the third and fourth quarters to 1,078.  The number of fundings in the third quarter of 2009 was 715, and the year before it was only 618.  So venture activity definitely picked up in both dollars and deals.  Will these new levels set the tone for 2010?

1054,BYD's Incredibly Sensible House of the Future,https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/16/byds-incredibly-sensible-house-of-the-future/,2009/10/16,"SHENZHEN, CHINA– One of my very early posts for TechCrunch referenced the “futurism” of 1950s Americana, where companies like Monsanto and Disney played out dreamy visions of a new automated way of living that never quite came true. I’m writing this post from Shenzhen, in Southern China—a place whose jaw-droppingly impractical-yet-beautiful architecture and building-size LED-lit billboards make the city look like it could be the set for just that kind of dreamy science fiction megatropolis. (Example? The other night I had drinks outside the InterContinental’s bar, which is shaped like a huge pirate ship.)
So imagine my expectations when I set out to see BYD’s “Village of the Future.” BYD—for those who don’t know—is a Chinese powerhouse of battery innovation with more than 130,000 employees, roughly 10% of whom work in R&D. The company is a living, breathing reality check to Westerners who think Southern China is merely a hub for assembling the technology U.S. designs. My BYD guide told me that the company gets at least one member of Western media coming through the office a week, many of them shocked that a Chinese company could be so innovative.
In recent years, BYD’s founder Wang Chuan-Fu has leveraged an un-sexy expertise in lithium electronics batteries into an electric car business. And, now, the company is harnessing that same technology to make solar panels that can efficiently store solar energy and manage it. It’s impressive enough stuff that Warren Buffett paid $230 million for 10% of the company in 2008, spurring every major media organization to start taking BYD seriously. (According to a great article in Fortune, he wanted even more.)
But you want futurism? Go somewhere else. This house of tomorrow—totally powered by solar power and piped with recycled rain water—looks just like any suburban house in the world. (See picture above. Yep. That’s it.) Turn on the tap and it’s just like turning it on at home. The air conditioning sounds and feels like the AC in my hotel. The company uses the top of the concept house for executive meetings. The conference rooms only stand out in their unremarkableness.
And, while it may make for uninteresting photos, that’s what makes BYD so impressive, and part of what would attract someone like Buffett to break the same cardinal rules of investing that convinced him to avoid the late 1990s dot com mania: Stay away from what you don’t understand. When my guide was taking me through BYD’s “museum” of its products, she waved her hnad dismissively at a sexy electric convertible, saying the ho-hum practical sedan was the company’s best-seller. What sells in a country where millions are scrambling into the middle class is practicality, not sex appeal.
Similarly, BYD’s house of the future is steeped in practicality, not look-at-me tree hugging or science fiction. That’s something that could actually make a difference for the solar industry and for smoggy, energy-guzzling China.

1055,Khosla Ventures Raises $1.1 Billion.  It's For More Than Just Clean Tech.,https://techcrunch.com/2009/09/01/khosla-ventures-raises-11-billion-its-for-more-than-just-clean-tech/,2009/09/01,"
Either Vinod Khosla has the magic or institutional investors are easing back into venture capital, or both.  His Khosla Ventures raised $1.1 billion for two new funds, with about $800 million going to Khosla Ventures III and $275 million for a new seed fund.
Taken together, the $1.1 billion is the biggest capital raise for a venture firm in two years, and if you count it as a first-time fund, it is the biggest capital raise in ten years.  While these are technically the third and fourth funds managed by the firm, it is the first time Khosla Ventures is taking outside money.  (CALPERS, the retirement fund for California state employees, is the biggest new limited partner).  Up until now, the capital primarily came from Khosla himself, who is a billionaire, a former star partner at Kleiner Perkins, and a co-founder of Sun Microsystems.
He founded Khosla Ventures in 2004, and now the firm has eight partners.  The firm also confirmed today that former Facebook CFO Gideon Yu is now a partner (you read it here first), as is new hire James Kim from CMEA Capital.
While Khosla is best known for funding clean tech startups these days, that is only about two thirds of his existing portfolio.  Khosla Ventures is also an investor in Tapulous, Aliph/Jawbone, iLike, iSkoot, Slide, Rearden Commerce, RingCentral, and and Xobni.  The new funds will continue to focus on both clean tech and IT in general.

1056,"Vinod Khosla, Risk Junkie",https://techcrunch.com/2009/06/03/vinod-khosla-risk-junkie/,2009/06/03,"I haven’t been much of a cleantech bull in the past, at least when it comes to venture capital investing. I think it’s a huge market, and there’s clearly a pressing social need. I just don’t quite think the science, government cooperation and economics are there yet for it to be a great opportunity for classic venture investing.
Sure there’s low-hanging fruit, and the outliers like Elon Musk who had the cojones to invest $70 million of his own money into building an electric car company. But a huge boom producing several multi-billion winners? Not yet, IMHO.
But Vinod Khosla greatly disagrees with me, and, frankly, you should listen to him, because he’s a lot smarter. That came across last week during a rare-sit down with Khosla, the famed venture investor and Sun Microsystems co-founder. It was for my Yahoo show, TechTicker, and I’d lobbied—nay, harassed—Khosla and his poor assistant for about eight months to get the meeting.
I’d initially intended to talk a lot about investing in India, since I’m going there in November, and it’s a cause close to Khosla’s heart. But we spent most the time talking about cleantech. Khosla Ventures arguably has the largest cleantech portfolio in the business. I counted more than 30 companies from the Web site alone. And, in many cases these are ambitious, science-heavy, swing-for-the-fences type plays. He is one of the only VCs I know who likes to do “science projects” – usually that’s a derogatory term in the industry, even for biotech VCs.
Here’s a link to our segment where Khosla explains why he believes ethanol—not hybrids and plug ins—are the answer to getting us off oil for good and here’s a link to the broader segment we did where he rebuts all my arguments about why cleantech won’t be the next big driver of Valley returns. He says that “clearly” ten Googles will be created from this opportunity, because it’s not really about solar, wind or biofuels, it’s about totally re-architecting the infrastructure of society.
Sounds ambitious, huh? I’m still not sure about cleantech as the next big Valley wave, but that ambition was what I liked about Khosla. Because I just don’t hear enough ambitious investment ideas these days in the Valley. Facebook apps, Twitter apps and iPhone apps are all great for consumers and for developers who want nice thriving businesses. And certainly, they’re great for Facebook, Twitter and Apple. But with the possible exceptions of Slide, Zynga and one or two others, they’re not the next companies that are going to drive the economy of Silicon Valley, mint millionaires, generate fees to support all those attorneys and accountants, and of course generate enough returns so that institutions want to keep investing in this asset class.
The fact that Facebook is considered risky scares me a little for the future of the Valley. This is a company that’s not necessarily doing something new; social networks have been around a while. It’s a company that mostly always been run at break-even. It’s a company that’s generating upwards of $500 million in revenue a year without really “figuring out” its business model. It’s a company that has no problem still raising money at nosebleed valuations. And most importantly, it’s still growing in almost every user metric that matters. That is not a particularly risky start-up.
Guess what? Twitter isn’t either. If you can’t look at the growth and usage patterns on Twitter and come up with several ideas to monetize it, you’re not very creative. Google built a great monetization engine because it knew intent—in other words, what you were searching for. Twitter knows way more about what’s going on at your head at any given moment, and that’s ripe for advertising and premium research/customer service products for companies. Is it a slam-dunk? Of course not. The crew still needs to execute, and the Twitter natives are getting restless to see some new features. But it’s all execution risk at this point, I’d argue.
Compare that to a company that’s making liquid biofuels out of bark or switchgrass. Khosla spoke right to this fact in the third segment of our interview, which I’ve embedded below. I started out by asking him if he’d turned his back on IT, which is after all where he made his fame and fortune. He gave a few examples of investments he’d snapped up in seemingly “over-invested areas.” One strong one was Aliph, the company who makes the Jawbone. It did $500k in 2006 to $140 million in 2008, and it’s still growing amid the downturn. (He says this at the 2:15 mark below.)
At minute 3:55, he talks about the venture capital business, and its troubling new aversion to risk. As he puts it the business is more about “capital” these days and less about “venture.” “There are too many people trying to avoid risk; too many people trying to deploy capital as opposed to invest in risk and invest in breakthroughs,” he said. You tell ’em, Khosla.

1057,"It's Earth Day, So Make Sure To Try Out Some Green Vanity Apps",https://techcrunch.com/2009/04/22/its-earth-day-so-make-sure-to-try-out-some-green-vanity-apps/,2009/04/22,"
Earth Day is in full swing.  Have you offset your carbon emissions yet?  Well, there are plenty of apps and Websites out there ready to help you do just that and more.  Green is the new black.  Speaking of which, if you want to be green, you’d better avoid black cars and Websites with all-black backgrounds (like goth sites and sometimes even Google).
But don’t avoid us.  We just decided to turn the background of TechCrunch black today in memory of Google’s noble effort last year, when its site went black in honor of “Earth Hour”.  And don’t even think about printing out an e-mail (not that you would—unless it had really important information on it that you needed hard copy of like a contract or a map, in which case, be my guest).
Seriously, green apps are great and we fully support them here at TechCrunch.  The first step to dealing with a problem is often to measure it.  And there are plenty of Websites that let you measure your carbon footprint such as Co2Stats, (for Websites) and Zerofootprint (for people).  But all too often these turn out to be nothing more than green vanity apps, designed to make you feel good about being green, but not really impacting the environment one way or the other.
For instance, consider a Facebook app just that launched called GoRecycle411 (developed by Jerry Kelly, the former VP of finance at Mark Cuban’s 2929 Entertainment).  You enter how many cans, bottles, newspapers, or office paper you’ve recycled and it tells you how much energy you saved and posts your achievement to all your friends via the Facebook News feed.  It keeps a tally, and translates your energy  into how many barrels of oil, trees, gallons of water, pounds of carbon dioxide, kilowatts of electricity, and cubic yards of garbage you save. It also keeps track of how much everyone using the application is saving.
The more you recycle, the more virtual points you get which you can spend on virtual gifts for friends like a polar bear, a windmill, or a tree.  Of course, you can enter whatever numbers you want, and you still get all those good green karma points.  All in all, it is better than a lot of other Facebook apps.  Not only do you get to show off how green you are, but you get to shame your friends into recycling at the same time.

Another example is Greenbookings, a Dutch travel site that calculates the carbon emissions caused by your vacation and offsets that at the end of the year by investing in green energy projects.  You pay nothing extra for the offsets, but you get to feel good about it and Greenbookings uses that as marketing lure to get you to book flights, hotels, and rental cars through its site.  Why not, right?  It is easier for one company to offset a years worth of travel-related carbon emissions than for each traveler to do so individually, and probably cheaper too.  Except that who knows what Greenbookings is going to invest that offset money into.  Last year, it put the money into a hydroelectric project in China. Water power is certainly cleaner than a coal plant, but isn’t China notorious for creating huge hydroelectric projects that wreak all sorts of other environmental and human havoc?  I guess you just have to trust Greenbookings on that one

1058,The Google Ventures Cheat Sheet,https://techcrunch.com/2009/04/04/the-google-ventures-cheat-sheet/,2009/04/04,"
Earlier this week, Google finally announced the formation of a new venture arm called Google Ventures.   It is where all smaller-scale venture investments from Google will now originate.   The day of the announcement, I chatted on the phone with Bill Maris and Rich Miner, the two Google executives who are managing the fund to get a sense of what they are interested in and how the fund will work.
It turns out they are open to investing in pretty much anything from the Internet and cloud computing to healthcare and mobile.  “We don’t want to artificially limit ourselves,” says Miner.  What about space elevators?  “Show me one that works,” retorts Maris, “and I will invest in it.”  The two of them will run the entire fund pretty much by themselves, bringing in other Googlers as needed for expertise and to help evaluate startups.  Both Maris and Miner have done venture investing before: Maris for Swedish holding company AB and Miner for Orange Ventures.  Miner will be leaving the Android team at Google, where he negotiated many of the deal with carriers and handset manufacturers.
A couple weeks ago, I argued that setting up a venture arm is a bad idea because there are better ways for Google to be deploying its capital.  Maris pointed out the relatively small amount of capital involved ($100 million) and responded: “Google has always had a strong belief in the power of entrepreneurs to do amazing things. Google has always made investments in companies, and we will continue to do that.”
My big concern, however, was that Google would invest for strategic reasons instead of purely economic ones.  Both Maris and Miner assured me that this would not be the case.  “It is true that strategics have had mixed results,,” acknowledges Miner, “but we think we can put this money to work.  Startups end up doing one thing and then have to shift direction.  If you take money from someone who wanted to see you do X because you said you would do X in that first Powerpoint, they may restrict your movement as you need to adapt.”  Miner says Google Ventures will avoid that pitfall.
If you are an entrepreneur trying to figure out how to navigate your way to a pitch session with them, below is a cheat sheet with the basics you should know.

A $100 million fund (that is the amount of capital allocated over the next 12 months).  “We don’t have to invest $100 million this year,” notes Maris, “it is what we want to do.”
It will focus on seed and early stage startups across any industry, but “won’t invest in a company that we don’t think we can properly vet and understand,” says Miner.
The first two portfolio investments are Pixazza (“AdSense for images”) and Silver Spring Networks (smart grid technology).
The sole limited partner is Google
All venture investing from the company will now be done through Google Ventures (for instance, Google.org will no longer be making venture investments)
Larger strategic investments in the range of hundreds of millions or billions of dollars will still be done by Google’s corporate development team led by David Lawee
One-way mirror policy to protect startups from prying eyes. “We  can look into Google, but Google can’t look into the companies without asking,” promises Miner.
Overriding investment criteria will be ROI, not strategic motivations.
But that doesn’t mean strategic considerations will be ignored either.  “If a company comes in the door and it looks like something important for Google to acquire,” says Maris, “we will defer to Google’s corporate development department to take a look.”

So where does that leave startups and can they really trust that one-way mirror?  Any startup related to the consumer Internet, search, or advertising would be well advised to be wary about revealing too much of themselves to Google Ventures. “This is a self-limiting process,” admits Maris.  “We are not going to know the group of people who do not want to talk to us.”  I’m sure they will have plenty of people knocking on their door regardless.

1059,Greenseng: A Green Search Engine That Actually Conserves Energy,https://techcrunch.com/2008/09/02/greenseng-a-green-search-engine-that-actually-conserves-energy/,2008/09/02,"
We’ve seen a few sites attempt to help turn the web green, but most of them have been little more than gimmicks.  Blackle purports to conserve energy by offering a “black” version of Google, which it says uses less energy than the engine’s standard white.  But Google has gone on to say that black may actually increase the amount of energy consumed by visitors (of course, this didn’t stop Google Israel from turning its site black in honor of Earth Hour).
Today, Y Combinator startup CO2Stats has launched a search engine that aspires to be truly green.  Greenseng (sounds like Ginseng) is a standard search engine, pulling results from Google’s Custom Search to produce results.  But instead of relying on a dubious method of energy conservation, CO2Stats measures the amount of energy used by its servers and the computers of its users and purchases renewable energy certificates (similar to carbon credits) to offset the environmental toll.
CO2Stats CTO Alex Wissner-Gross says that Greenseng isn’t meant to generate revenue though advertising.  Instead, the site is using proceeds from its certification business that allows websites to purchase renewable energy certificates in return for a badge that labels them as “Green Certified”.
But while Greenseng may not directly be earning any money, it may help CO2Stats pull in a slew of new customers.  In its next iteration, the site will be using Yahoo’s powerful BOSS search API to incorporate some of its own data.  Users will be able to see the environmental footprint of each site in their search results with data pulled from CO2Stats, which may give companies more of an incentive to get Green Certified.

Buying credits to offset seach engine usage isn’t a new idea.  In April we wrote about EcoCho, a search engine wrapper for Google and Yahoo that promises to plant “up to two trees” for every 1,000 searches on the site (we noted that zero could fall within that definition).  Only a week after launching, Google pulled the site from its advertising partnership – not a good sign, though it didn’t specify the details.

1060,Trilliant Raises $40 Million For Work On Smart Power Grid,https://techcrunch.com/2008/08/19/trilliant-raises-40-million-for-work-on-smart-power-grid/,2008/08/19,"
Trilliant, a company that works on the nation’s “Smart Grid“, has closed a $40 million funding round led by MissionPoint Capital Partners and zouk ventures.  As part of the deal, Mark J. Lewis of MissionPoint and Anthony Fox of zouk will be joining the company’s Board of Directors.
Smart Grid refers to the improved power grid being rolled out nationwide (and in some European countries) that makes use of computers and advanced sensors to more efficiently distribute power, saving money and cutting back on emissions.  Older power grids still rely on technology developed over a century ago, which has led the US Congress to pass the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, allotting $100M in funding every year between 2008-2012.
Earlier this year we saw another similarly large investment in more efficient power sources when Infinia raised $50 million for its renewable energy source, which combines a Stirling engine with a large solar collector.

1061,CO2Stats Compensates For Your Site's Pollution,https://techcrunch.com/2008/08/14/co2stats-compensates-for-your-sites-pollution/,2008/08/14,"Yesterday Y Combinator backed CO2Stats announced the launch of a fully functional version of their emissions measuring service for websites.  The launch comes nearly a year after the release of a prototype widget that was designed to test the market and gauge user response. The idea eventually attracted enough press and positive feedback for the founders to take their service and calculations to the next level.
CO2Stats makes a website “green” by calculating its environmental footprint and buying green power (i.e. wind, solar) elsewhere on the grid to compensate.  The service calculates not only the energy used to power a site’s server, but also the power used by client machines visiting the site.  It turns out that visitors actually consume more power than the servers themselves.

The methodology for calculating energy consumption is extremely rigorous, as it must be for something like this to be accepted.  The system takes into account geographic location of a site’s servers and visitors, time spent on a site, client device type (mobile, laptap, etc), and even the size of the page window on the user’s screen.
Sites supporting the service sport a clean energy badge that, when clicked on, displays CO2 emissions resulting from visitors, servers, and the network, along with a breakdown of the fuel types used to power the site and where the power was generated.
CO2Stats charges a flat rate that is dependent on the cumulative amount of power they spot their clients.  This ensures that sites aren’t punished for peaks in traffic, and makes the idea more attractive to sites with a large userbase. The service could make it big if it becomes standard practice for companies to maintain a “green” web site.  Electricity generation required for information and communication techologies is currently responsible for 2% of global CO2 emissions, and this number is only growing. Current clients include Gazelle, and a number of environmental awareness sites.

1062,Waste Management Launches a Social Network,https://techcrunch.com/2008/06/17/waste-management-launches-a-social-network/,2008/06/17,"Frankly this should just be an application on Facebook and MySpace, it would get better traction. But that’s not what the consultants told Waste Management (a $20 billion company that, well, manages waste), I’m guessing, since today they’ve launched Greenopolis, a social network for greenies.
They’re committed, they say, to connecting people and businesses on green issues, and teach people about ways to be more environmentally sound. Like other social networks, members can create profiles and add friends. Users also rack up Green Points and have a Green Profile, which shows just how much they care about the environment.
Greenopolis, I suspect, is designed to show that Waste Management cares about the environment more than anything else. So in a way, it’s like an advertisement. See ZeroFootprint, a Canadian company we’ve covered that also creates local social networks around carbon offsetting in partnership with cities.

1063,Going Green: Getting to work despite high gas prices,https://techcrunch.com/2008/04/29/going-green-getting-to-work-despite-high-gas-prices/,2008/04/29," Anybody feeling pinched by high gas prices? You should. Expensive gas not only hits us squarely in the pocketbook when we fill our gas tanks, but it makes everything else more expensive as well; air travel, shipping packages, groceries, you name it.
Aside from being expensive, gasoline is hard on the environment too. Here are a few viable alternatives (that are available now) if you decide that you’ve had enough with high gas prices and/or you’d like to go easier on the environment.

Public Transportation, Walking, Carpooling, Bicycling, Hourly Rentals
Yes, yes, these are all nice options. Look into them in your hometown. None of them are very geeky or gadgety and/or they all vary from place to place. I’d be remiss if I didn’t at least bring them up, though. I got rid of my car in October and now I walk, take the subway (Boston), or use Zipcar.com to get where I need to go. It’s easy!
Segway i2 Commuter
If you’d like to ditch your car altogether and you live in a relatively temperate climate, not too far from work, why not just bite the nerdly bullet and pick up a Segway? The i2 Commuter model starts at $5,460 and is good for almost 25 miles before it needs to be recharged.
Your friends will think you’re cool and environmentally conscious ladies will be all over you like patchouli on a Phish fan. Yum.

Zapino Electric Scooter
Hey there, Businesslady, I like your sassy summer ‘do and your fun Zapino electric scooter from ZAP Electric Cars.
This is one of your more expensive scooters at just under $4,000, but it’s all electric so you’ll save an ass-load on gas. Top speed is about 30MPH and the range is 30 miles so, again, make sure you live close to work.

Tesla Roadster

Far and away the most impressive car to date (in my opinion), the Tesla Roadster is all electric, yet sacrifices very little in the name of the environment. Well, except maybe that it costs over $100,000 and there’s a 15-month wait and $60,000 is due just to get on the list. However, if I had that kind of money, I’d definitely get one of these.
The Roadster is 100% electric, goes 0 to 60 in under four seconds, has a 13,000 rpm redline, gets the equivalent of 135 miles to the gallon, goes 220 miles on a single charge, and costs less than two cents per mile’s worth of energy.

Electric Vehicles versus Regular Vehicles
I’d jump at the chance to get any all-electric vehicle, actually, since the cost of “filling” them up is so much less than conventional cars.  Steve Heckeroth of the American Solar Energy Society says that electric cars cost roughly two cents per mile versus gas, bio-diesel, ethanol vehicles, which cost 20 to 30 cents per mile. Here’s a short video with more information.
For many of us, though, buying an all-electric vehicle or riding a goofy Segway to work just isn’t practical yet. So here’s a list of the most fuel-efficient cars, trucks, and SUVs on the road today. The numbers following each vehicle represent its city and highway mileage and clicking on the vehicle’s name will take you to its website.

1064,A Startup That Fights Global Warming,https://techcrunch.com/2007/06/06/startups-that-fight-global-warming/,2007/06/06,"I met with Canadian startup Zerofootprint during my trip to Toronto last week for the Mesh Conference. The company, which is a non-profit, was started and funded by Ron Dembo, formerly the founder of Algorithmics Incorporated.
Their chief goal, says the company, is to raise awareness among individuals and groups that everything we consume has some impact on the environment. The company is fighting global warming in two ways: encourage carbon reduction, and sell offsets for the remainder.
First, they are encouraging people and companies to be aware of how much carbon they are emitting into the atmosphere through consumption (cars, heating, food, etc.) and encouraging them to find ways to lower those emissions. For individuals this is done through their emissions calculator. The company also creates white label websites for companies, groups and cities. See, for example, Zerofootprint Toronto, a sort of social network for Toronto citizens to calculate their emissions and interact with other members.
Second, Zerofootprint offers individuals and entities the ability to purchase carbon offsets directly at their “Carbon Shop.”
When large companies like Yahoo go carbon neutral, they will usually purchase large amounts of offsets via one of the official exchanges, like the one in Chicago or Montreal. Those are good for large organizations or consultants who represent them; but smaller buyers need a way to buy smaller offsets easily. That’s where Zerofootprint comes in. Want to offset a cross country flight? Purchase a CA$10 offset and the company says you are neutral.
The big exchanges are are sometimes criticized for not properly monitoring sellers to ensure proper carbon reduction. Zerofootrpint says they do not buy offsets from exchanges because of these concerns. Instead they work directly with sellers, usually tree growers, and make sure they are legally bound to leave the trees in perpetuity.
The company charges 10% over their cost when selling offsets. They say this helps cover their operating costs. Also, they buy offsets in bulk and in advance, and they have some capital risk.
Zerofootprint is actively trying to do deals with companies as well. They’ve recently signed an agreement with Air Canada that went live just a week ago. The program encourages customers to buy an offset when purchasing a flight ticket on the airline. They say they are also negotiating with Virgin Atlantic and others, they say.
The company has twelve employees and is based in Toronto. Competitors include TerraPass and Native Energy.
After meeting with the company and hearing their story, we decided to do more than just write about them. We are working with Zerofootprint to ensure that our TechCrunch20 Conference in September is carbon neutral. They will consult with us on ways to keep emissions to a minimum, and we will be purchasing offsets for the remainder. More on the TechCrunch20 blog.
